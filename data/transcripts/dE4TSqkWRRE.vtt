this is a non-domain hearing um on uh
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment to senate bill 125. um i
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
assume everybody has a copy of it it has
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
my name on it
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
and the number is 1237. um
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
and what what i'll do a brief thing and
 
00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
and what what i'll do a brief thing and
then

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
um i will i will then um ask people to
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
speak who have signed up for it
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
um basically uh one of the reasons i did
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
this is the non-germanius are
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're still liquor related
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
everything's liquor related but the
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
non-germanius is uh there
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
are different rsas that were being
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
brought in then came in in the original
 
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.030 align:start position:0%
brought in then came in in the original
bill

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
um and but one thing that i was acutely
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
aware was that we are going to be
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
mending certain sections
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i really want to make i think i know
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
got a lot of new members in the
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
that this sometimes is a little
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
complicated so it's important
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know i figured this is a good
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity so everybody can
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
follow how we do how happens so when you
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
look at the bill
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
at the amendment that have you'll see on
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
line one
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's it talks about um amending uh by
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
section five so that means
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
section one two and three and four are
 
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
section one two and three and four are
untouched

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
untouched
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
in the original bill so if you were to
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
really follow along what we're passing
 
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.510 align:start position:0%
really follow along what we're passing
or

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
pass it it said you still need to have
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
the copy
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
from the senate of how senate bill 125
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
and have those sections so then you see
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be mending section 5
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
and then if you look on the next
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
page again then you have section 6 and
 
00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:50.310 align:start position:0%
page again then you have section 6 and
then

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
and this is this is a little confusing
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh some of it's important to follow
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
um if you get to the the last page page
 
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
um if you get to the the last page page
three

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it will say amend the bill by
 
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
and it will say amend the bill by
inserting

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
inserting
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
after section seven the following
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
in renumber sections eight to read as
 
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.309 align:start position:0%
in renumber sections eight to read as
12.

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
so you say oh my god well now what
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
happens okay so now we're going to stick
 
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.469 align:start position:0%
happens okay so now we're going to stick
some

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
new paragraphs in because we always want
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
the effective date to be the last line
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill okay why i don't know it's
 
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.469 align:start position:0%
in the bill okay why i don't know it's
just

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
just tradition but we don't like it in
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
the middle of a bill we want it always
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
so section eight which was if you were
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bill
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
the um effective date that is now number
 
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
the um effective date that is now number
12.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment does
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%

don't you could you do that pam
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
sure sure all right so let's um
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
senator gannon yep senator again i'm
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to now promote him up
 
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
going to now promote him up
and

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh oh
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
he disappeared okay so he's gonna have
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
to try to come back in again
 
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.490 align:start position:0%
probably uh
 
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.389 align:start position:0%
probably uh
[Music]

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
mr yes good morning uh will he be
 
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
mr yes good morning uh will he be
testifying

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
as the uh sponsor of this he is uh he's
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
detecting the sponsor anybody can you
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
know when this
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
this is technically i don't know this is
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
like a hearing but it's really a
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
so you know pretty much anybody who want
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
to weigh in we
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
will certainly entertain listen to them
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
but that um because uh he has seen the
 
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
but that um because uh he has seen the
amendment

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
and wanted to speak towards the
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment he wanted to assure everybody
 
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:14.949 align:start position:0%
amendment he wanted to assure everybody
that

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
he's in support that's the reason why he
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
signed up for it
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
um so you won't be doing an overview
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
of what you have so um my overview i'm
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
gonna let
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
aiden explain to you what the with the
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
overreview is
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
um simpson because he's the one who
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
really um and i
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
i i had all the ideas in my head but
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
he's the one that put it in paper and
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
put in the words that put the amendment
 
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.430 align:start position:0%
put in the words that put the amendment
together

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
so he was i was going to have him
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
explain it okay so there's senator
 
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
explain it okay so there's senator
gannon

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
gannon
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay and i'm going to promote the
 
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.230 align:start position:0%
okay and i'm going to promote the
panelists

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
panelists
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
then we just love computers
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
ah can't wait till we get back to normal
 
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.829 align:start position:0%
ah can't wait till we get back to normal
so

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
so mr chair while we're waiting yes
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
just perhaps save time later on do you
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
have to know what the science is behind
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
a maximum of 27 gallons in provision
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
hold on never mind okay there he is
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
so to answer just just a second bill uh
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
um pretty much all these numbers
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
that are in there are just uh statutory
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that we have created in the past
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
and say they were you know i would i
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
would be honest they were created out of
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
whole cloth
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes so but i mean i would say that
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to the eight the magic
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
number of eight percent in terms of
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
of other drinks that number was created
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
over time based upon what was in the
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
over time based upon what was in the
marketplace

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
but there's not necessarily any science
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
behind twenty there's no science on
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
anything everything the legislature it's
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
a settled sign
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
everything's everything is a rabbit
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay senator gannon you're on thank you
 
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.790 align:start position:0%
okay senator gannon you're on thank you
um

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
so where are we at so i read your bill
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing i had a question on
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh chairman hunt was um in line
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
22 through 26 of your amendment
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
i just didn't and it's probably because
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm a lawyer and i dwell on small
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
details it
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear to me that i could sell at
 
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.230 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear to me that i could sell at
where

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know my manufacturing plant is and
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
also at the
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
one specialty outlet is that clear
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
enough to you in the writing
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
so uh actually that would already uh be
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
in the current statute
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay so you know that's why it was never
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
addressed in the bill because that
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
was always it was always the opportunity
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
to sell in your
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing location okay um so
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise i thought your memo was really
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
good i wish i could draft so
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
which well me too so i'm not going to re
 
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.629 align:start position:0%
which well me too so i'm not going to re
rep

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
rep
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know i presented it a week ago um
 
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.670 align:start position:0%
you know i presented it a week ago um
i'm

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
relatively happy with what you've done
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
and um what was my one change i
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
suggested to on friday
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
you're wondering why uh nanos nanos
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't have another location
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh oh yeah so why are you because you're
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
thinking it's not a
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
bar and it shouldn't be at so many
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
places you're giving us the one well no
 
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.430 align:start position:0%
places you're giving us the one well no
no

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
the nano it's actually is there's
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
several several ideas of thoughts about
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on with nanos
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
um first of all the nano license is a
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
very very very very cheap license
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay as a matter of fact
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
that so you start off with simply saying
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's okay you get what you pay for so if
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
you really want to have an extra
 
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
you really want to have an extra
location

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
you should uh you know upgrade to the
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
big boy license
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
um and let alone the fact that you're
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to be a nano you're
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're actually supposed you know you're
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing this like in your
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
garage or
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know sort of sort of a hobby so uh
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
you really you know how can you
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
be stretching yourself to have two
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
locations when when it's just supposed
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be a hobby
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
um and third is that uh the dirty little
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
secret is is that
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
because their license is so cheap they
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
could open
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
three or four nanos for the price of one
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
custom brewer so uh there's really no
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
need and because the nanos are limited
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
to their production
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
anyway so so they're really you know the
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
idea of having
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
an extra location really doesn't make
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
any sense at this point can i ask you
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes um so why can't i team up with if i
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
own one of these small
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
nanos why what's the problem with me
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
teaming up with another
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
nano and having it like an outlet on
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
portsmouth so we get exposure
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
but i'm cutting the cost in half i'd say
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's a concept we should be thinking
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
about in terms of going future years
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
about how
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
multiple locations can have a joint
 
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.629 align:start position:0%
multiple locations can have a joint
location

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
um it notwithstanding that it
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
technically is a violation of the
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
three-tier system because what they
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
would really
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
want is that location that's being
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
opened up
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
is be a uh carrying of carrying all
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
these different beers
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
should really be a an off-premise
 
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
should really be a an off-premise
licensee

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
and and that's you know not they should
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
a beverage location there should be an
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
so the question is does the three-tier
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
uh you know language we
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
bar them from having some joint
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
ownership or join
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
things but theoretically there's nothing
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
stopping anybody to
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
say okay i'm going to open up an
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to carry all these local
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
local beers and everything like that
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's nothing
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
stopping them from doing that now
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the issue is is it ownership and
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
who's it ownership and how many people i
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly discuss that but
 
00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.269 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly discuss that but
um

00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
at this point anybody can start an
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee and
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
and carry all the beers they want you
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
know and
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
have it all self-distributed by all
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
these new all these different
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturers which i would hope
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
somebody would do that frankly but
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know how much of
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
our market is for that other than that
 
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.550 align:start position:0%
our market is for that other than that
i'm

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
very very happy with your amendment okay
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
great uh representative burroughs has a
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
question yes um i do have a question
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
um in um section
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
three um we're talking about section
 
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:31.829 align:start position:0%
three um we're talking about section
three

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
talking about the names of addresses of
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
purchasers to whom the alcoholic
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
beverages are shipped
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
i i'm i don't i didn't see this in the
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
original bill and
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
what is what is the purpose for that why
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
do they need to have the
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
names and addresses of the um consumer
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh so section three
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
number two the proof uh in the amendment
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
your time out
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so there is it's a three
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
nine four i'm sorry i'm sorry it's in
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
four it's in four number two okay number
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
four okay this is direct shipping
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so direct shipping means that
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody is shipping
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
from their location to um to
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
somebody in their residence
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes so they report to the state
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um that so that we we
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
collected eight percent tax
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
um we actually have a cross-checking
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
system which is if they use
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
ups or fedex we can cross check to see
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
that that that was properly booked and
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
entered in and that's the reason why you
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
have the name and address of where it
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
was shipped to
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
follow up please further questions um
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
how onerous
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
is that going to be for these companies
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's been the law for 25 years
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative mclair um thank you mr
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
chairman i had that same objection that
 
00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
chairman i had that same objection that
anita

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
anita
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
has but if it's been the law i don't
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
see that uh we can change it right now
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
but i do have another
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
question and that's on it's the second
 
00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.470 align:start position:0%
question and that's on it's the second
page

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's number 32 on page two
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i go into one of these these places
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
and i can order
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
one beer and then if i want to order
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
another beer
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
i gotta have something to eat and i'm
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
out of there that
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
i i don't quite understand that why the
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
one beer limit
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
well okay well that's still kind of the
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
heart of this legislation so i guess we
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
we should address this all right
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
so um it it goes back to
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
at one point in time in history uh if
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
you were a beverage manufacturer
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
um you didn't uh you didn't have any
 
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
um you didn't uh you didn't have any
tastings

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
tastings
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay you you didn't nobody came nobody
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
came into your location at all
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
and so then we said well we should allow
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
them to have taste
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the first question is um that
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
we came up with uh how much can they
 
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.950 align:start position:0%
we came up with uh how much can they
taste

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
taste
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
so the idea of this tasting the original
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
taste of tastings
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
was just the samplers was just four
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
ounces okay
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
and you're gonna have four ounces of
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
whatever they have available for
 
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.110 align:start position:0%
whatever they have available for
tastings

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
tastings
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
so that could be more than 16 ounces if
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
they have more than four beers let's say
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
they had six beers so now
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
that could be six times four but then
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
some people say no
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
what people really want is they want to
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
come in and just have a pint i just want
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
to have a pint of here
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
so then we change the legislation to a
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
pint and at the same time we also
 
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
pint and at the same time we also
clarified

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
that whether they could sell this beer
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
because before those samples were given
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
away free the law actually
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
fired that beer and wine and everything
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
had to be given away free
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
and so so they'll say well we're giving
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and this is only
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
so some people say well we really want
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to charge for that pint we
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
want that full point we want to charge
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
and that was fine and then the next
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
debate was to make sure we clarified
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
if they're selling that pint of beer
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
they need to collect the meals tax
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know the old rooms and meals tax so
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
that was so what you're seeing is
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
every year we've done these different
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
steps we could
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
go down this pipeline now the ultimate
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
question is well then
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
gee you see in other states you can have
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
as many pints as
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
well you can't have as many as you want
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
because you might have too many and that
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
can't they're not allowed to overserve
 
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.830 align:start position:0%
can't they're not allowed to overserve
you

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
but uh in new hampshire we've always had
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
this require a food requirement in other
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
words we're the only state and
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly in new england and i don't
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
i don't i really don't know
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh how many different states but we're
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
really could be the only state in the
 
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.029 align:start position:0%
really could be the only state in the
union

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
union
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
that requires that uh we don't have bars
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay we just don't have bars you know
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're you know i mean i in my
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
memory from pittsburgh or even when i
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
was in college and you know or prep
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
school at deerfield
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
when i was actually legal and drink at
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
18 i'd go into greenville mass and there
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
was this hole in the wall bar and all it
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
sold was 50 cent
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
beers you know and but they would sell
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
they had no food requirement now in new
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire we don't have
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
that every every facility that sells
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol has to have a food requirement
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
so at what point um when you're talking
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
about a beverage manufacturer report
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
how far are we going to go down this
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
line without this food requirement
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
so uh what the the compromise and the
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
way we have kind of negotiated and my
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
that the um the the the brewers these
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
custom brewers and certainly the neos
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're okay with what we have come up
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
with what the compromise has been
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
which is that you can get that one pint
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay you can
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'll get the full pint you get a pint
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
now if you want that second pint now
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
they have to be a nano plus then did you
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
get that little spreadsheet of all the
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
different that aiden send out it was
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
very handy and everyone i probably
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
should have meant to send it out again
 
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.789 align:start position:0%
should have meant to send it out again
but

00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
it was a little handy that it shows you
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
all the different licenses
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
and all the different things that
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
they're required to do so we do have
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
this nano
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
plus but the nano plus was not not that
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
much more in license fee
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
and but that it did allow to
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
have that second plane but under the
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
condition that
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturer would have
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
somebody there
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
selling food and so since we know that
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
that nano shouldn't be in the food
 
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.870 align:start position:0%
that nano shouldn't be in the food
business

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
so we did allow for food trucks for
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
instance that you can or you can have
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know bring anybody and
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
bring someone in who can make food or
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
sell food um
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so we have that is where the the
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
political compromise has been over the
 
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.310 align:start position:0%
political compromise has been over the
years

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh the last couple years is that why we
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
do it now
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
at some point you say is well you know
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
should go beyond two pints and go to the
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
sky's limit
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
but i think we're really at the edge now
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
where we pretty much have got the
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
um this is a reasonable compromise
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
they're not restaurants they're not
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to go forward and get the full
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
restaurant license
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to be in that
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
business right they're beverage
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
okay and i see connie has a hand her
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
hand up yes
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
i was trying the space bar and that
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
didn't work i'm sorry yeah that just
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
works randomly
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
i would love to have aiden send that out
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
again it was really an incredible
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
resource i'm sure i have one someplace
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
but if he would send it out again that
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
would be fantastic
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i'd just like to follow up with what
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying because i was around for a
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
lot of that legislation
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
and um it it just always kind of
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
wrinkles my my sensitivities that with
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
the nano plus you can actually go in and
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
get a quart of beer and have a bag of
 
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
get a quart of beer and have a bag of
peanuts

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
peanuts
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
um it's um i think we
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then no you can't have a bag of
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
peanuts all right a couple of bags of
 
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.269 align:start position:0%
peanuts all right a couple of bags of
peanuts

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
peanuts
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
and peanut butter on this piece of bread
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh nonetheless food does not have to be
 
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
uh nonetheless food does not have to be
a

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
staple or a meal or something of that
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
sort um
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and i would like to just reiterate what
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
i've said before
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
um and again i've worked on the liquor
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
bills as you know i
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
chaired the subcommittee on liquor last
 
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
chaired the subcommittee on liquor last
session

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
and i i really wonder how much we're
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
putting band-aids on band-aids
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
and and um given that we had
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
um we had some recent concerns with the
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
audit and some changes because of the
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
audit some changes
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
outside the audit i really think we have
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
to start to look at
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
getting the structure of the three-tier
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
system intact
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
before we keep putting band-aids and
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
band-aids and band-aids and i'm not
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying that i'm opposed to
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
some of these things
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
i like many people enjoy a glass of wine
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
with my peanuts
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
however um i i am getting concerned
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
about that and um
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know once we look at this and start
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
to say you can have a quart of beer with
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit of food
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
are we are we pushing the limits and
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
if we don't like the three-tier system
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
if that needs to be jettisoned
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
i really think it's time to take a look
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
at that we've evolved in terms of our
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
liquor we've evolved in terms of our
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
economy on the basis of liquor uh we
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
have restaurants that
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
that are very supportive of liquor
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that helps them to prosper
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and bring tourists
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh to our state i worked with john
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
paduck on a commission for tourism
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
as it relates to liquor there's so much
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
out there and and it's no wonder that we
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
have little questions as we go forward
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you for giving me a second for
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
that little bit of a soapbox but i do
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
think that there needs to be
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
something more than just peace peace
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
peace let's let's get this
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
fleshed out um and put together so that
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's best for our state
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
right well i i well one piece i want to
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
over a is that
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh even before i got involved in the
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
ever that this issue ever came to
 
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.029 align:start position:0%
ever that this issue ever came to
commerce

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay um the three-tier system was
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
already thrown in the trash can when it
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
came to
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh brew pups and uh so that
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
obviously everything we do because it's
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
mother may i
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
everything is every step has to be we
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
have to decide what we're going to allow
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
and how we rationalize how we allow it
 
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.789 align:start position:0%
and how we rationalize how we allow it
okay

00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
i would say when it comes to the food
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
requirement and as i've mentioned before
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you've heard me say um i
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
food requirement was something
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
that when initially how did they really
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
think it was that important or was
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
everybody really conscious of it i don't
 
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.350 align:start position:0%
everybody really conscious of it i don't
know

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
but i think when when you look at
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative abramson's bill what he's
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know all right is it do we really
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
want bacon and eggs and
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know and bread is you know at the at
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
the convenience store
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
is that really a judge of what we mean
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
by the food requirement
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
so i say almost everything we do with
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
the liquor law
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
is is is a progression it changes all
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
right we have to
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
way we look at it way we're handling it
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
way we perceive it
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i certainly i'm gonna say is that
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
i've tried before
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
to actually have bars in new hampshire
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i was gonna it was gonna be a
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
whopping fee but you know if they really
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
we were gonna have one but uh you know
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
the bill died and
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and and uh and i did another one it was
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
sort of like to
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
change the licenses and that bill died
 
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.110 align:start position:0%
change the licenses and that bill died
so

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
um i would say at this point um i i
 
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.549 align:start position:0%
um i would say at this point um i i
certainly

00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense and this is just my
 
00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense and this is just my
opinion

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and obviously everybody's entitled their
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
own opinion that
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that this food
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
requirement is not peanuts it's not
 
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.750 align:start position:0%
requirement is not peanuts it's not
chips

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
chips
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's anything that rooms and meat room
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
meals tax
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
is taxing so if meals tax is very
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
that statue is very distinctive and very
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
big and i'll never forget it because i
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
was around i was in the house at the
 
00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
was around i was in the house at the
time

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
when we were debating what they called
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
the snack tax
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay that what was going to be in the
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
middle tax and was snacks like when you
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
buy from a machine or it was a you know
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the peanut butter and crackers or
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
peanuts and stuff
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
and that was the clear decision that um
 
00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
and that was the clear decision that um
those

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
are not meals they're not
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily healthy foods right that and
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that was never
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
that was not included in the meals tax
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
but that the meals tax really
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
was going to be as well distinctive it
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
it had there had to be a little bit of
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
cooking involved there had to be some
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
heating things up and then
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
and that like i say that um to me is the
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
direction i think we should go
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
in in firming up that uh you know that
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
people um you know have some kind of
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
foods and
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that uh that
 
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that uh that
tuckerman's

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
tuckerman's
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
is is now you know they're they're
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing paninis
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
which is really easy piece of bread you
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
get the cheese you squeeze it
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
stick it in and voila they got a nice
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
sandwich and it's healthy for you and
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good sandwich and i think that's
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
shows that we're making progress on this
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
issue so i'm not overly worried about
 
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:28.710 align:start position:0%
issue so i'm not overly worried about
the

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
food concern but in terms of the
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
three-tier and what the you know
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
how does three tier really mean much in
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
this whole scheme of things um
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's uh it's a concept but
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know we've obviously have we've got
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
we've worked so many
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
loopholes around around it and so many
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
things around it i'm
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i would say that we i
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
would fall um i swear on defending
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
defending the three-tier uh i think max
 
00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:55.110 align:start position:0%
defending the three-tier uh i think max
had

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
the next one to have his hand up so
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative abramson i was just going
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
to make a quick comment on this
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
three-tiered system
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
i thought of putting together a study
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee bill on that but i think it
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be i would i would rather go back
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
to your original idea
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
of splitting the commerce committee into
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
three you know i have the liquor
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know alcohol related laws group but
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if we could have that
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
group meet over the summer and review
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
all the three-tier issue problems um
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
and and take input from members and see
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with the food
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
requirement if they want to keep the
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
three-tier system or go to something
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
proportionate or what have you
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
yeah you know that's absolutely
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely what my plan is that we'll
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
we'll have our divisions the three
 
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.470 align:start position:0%
we'll have our divisions the three
divisions

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
and so we'll go forward come next fall
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
based on those three divisions
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and and the liquor one is free to
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
talk about whatever they want to talk
 
00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.310 align:start position:0%
talk about whatever they want to talk
about

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh and so yes no that that's absolutely
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking about doing max thank
 
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.310 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking about doing max thank
you

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
did you have a date or uh or not a date
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
but a
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
general ballpark of when and how often
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
do you want to meet
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
again i'm i'm i'm assuming that you know
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
that i don't know what you know again
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
july and august we've always
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
stayed out of the house so i'm assuming
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
that come september
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
we'll all be back and then i'll have
 
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.110 align:start position:0%
we'll all be back and then i'll have
they'll

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
they'll
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
each each division will have its own
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
we'll call the meetings work with the
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
people to in terms of calling meetings i
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
know some people want to take vacations
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
in september and october so we obviously
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
want to be flexible with that when
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
which each subcommittee and uh and what
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing on vacation time but
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so so but yes i would say i
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be in person come september i'd
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have at least one or two
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
meetings before that because uh
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
in order to introduce bills for next
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
year i'm also one of the co-chairs on
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
the vegas caucus which proposes uh
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know repealing certain laws and
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
legalizing certain things
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
um so i'd like to have some meetings and
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
and and have some input and discuss
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
ideas rather than introduce a bill
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
find out if there's actually any
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
interest from the committee in putting
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
some of these bills in okay well i'll
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
start working on it right now and get it
 
00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
start working on it right now and get it
together

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative bilo yeah thank you
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if the restaurant and
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
lodging association um
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
are they around today so they did not
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
sign up
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
um i see henry is there so and i don't
 
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.430 align:start position:0%
um i see henry is there so and i don't
know

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
the summers is there so um i can sure we
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
can get we can get henry to
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
maybe convince him to speak yeah because
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um i think they really should
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
be speaking up because it will affect
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
the restaurant lodging association
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that they did
 
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that they did
wave

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
wave
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
i've crafted this amendment and working
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
working with the commission that they
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
are they are this
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
follows with the guidelines it doesn't
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
change anything from what they're doing
 
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.630 align:start position:0%
change anything from what they're doing
and

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
and actually gives them a new
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually get direct
 
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:52.950 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually get direct
shipping

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
to them so so it actually gives them
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
something that they didn't have before
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
but okay is that's it for the committee
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
all right so i will now
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
call the next person and sign up was i
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
was going to call
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
well i don't know henry uh you know
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh henry rave your hand if you want to
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
talk otherwise if you feel like you
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to say don't bother
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%

and be part of this
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that um i've been
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
following this uh
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
all morning long and i think that it's a
 
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.509 align:start position:0%
all morning long and i think that it's a
very

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
informative discussion you're having
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
especially on the three-tier system
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i think it everyone understands that
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
the three-tier system
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
started back with the end of prohibition
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
the reason for prohibition was that
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was a lot of bootlegging that
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
was going on and it was just a wild west
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
of everything
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
and when they decided to repeal
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
prohibition they came up with the
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
concept of the three-tier system to
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
protect the fact that a manufacturer
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
could would not be a wholesaler
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
and a wholesaler would not be a retailer
 
00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
and a wholesaler would not be a retailer
therefore

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
having certain chinese walls if you want
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
to call it that between the different
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
factions of a production and
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
distribution of alcoholic beverages
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that's that's served us well for all
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
these years
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason why there's a
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
three-tier system
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
and and so we would certainly support
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we always have supported that
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
our association was formed back in 1933
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh when we saw this coming and it was a
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
concern that we wanted to see the 3g
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
system to protect
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
all three entities in in the process of
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
doing that going forward
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
i also want to just thanks well i have
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
the time to do this to thank
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and members of the
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
committee for the work you've done
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
on this amendment and this other part uh
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
we are very much supportive of
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
everything you're doing with this
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what we would like to see
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
happen to protect that
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
the other part is talk about the food
 
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
the other part is talk about the food
requirement

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
there's a concern with that that
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant lodging is has
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
issued as long as we have too that we're
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about drinking
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
without any food consumption and that
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
when you take food into consideration
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
absorbing some of that you're having
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
less likely
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
being being impaired during the process
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
so there is a reason for it's not
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
protecting anything in particular it's
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
more of protecting the public from
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
great um are you willing to take a
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
question because i absolutely
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
represented van gaal do you have a
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
question for actually
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
not i have a comment that i would like
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
to address to you
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
two issues um again you know my
 
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:15.990 align:start position:0%
two issues um again you know my
attention

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to uh language detail and um
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the amendment in line seven on page
 
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.349 align:start position:0%
in the amendment in line seven on page
one

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
the permit shall authorize the holder to
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
sell and delivery
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol beverages i believe the word
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
in order to make the amendment correct
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is line seven line seven page one
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
to sell in the deliver
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
and while i'm at it on page two line
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
four i would just like to
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
mention a um something that i often um
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
comment about because it is bothersome
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
the words in a timely manner i never
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
know how we define that
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
is a timely manner one day one year one
 
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
is a timely manner one day one year one
month

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh how does one define that i realize
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's a very difficult concept to deal
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
with but leaving something open-ended
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
like that has always been um
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh i think in timely matter is the
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
eyes of the beholder
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
so but okay and then deliver versus
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
delivery um
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know theoretically we should correct
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
that but uh just so for everybody knows
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
there is another entity a step
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh before bills go get signed by the
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
governor and it's called enrolled bills
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's a part of the legislative
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
administration committee
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
which i i did have the
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
fortune to be the chair for one term in
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
which the enrolled committee
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh would go through anything that of
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
those kind of typos
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and correct them so there is a process
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
but i i would i yes we would try to
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
correct it and while i'm aware of that
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
our integrity is our as a committee is
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
always on the line and we want to be the
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
best that we can be
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
we want to be good wordsmiths
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh so
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh henry did not put his hand up so i
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
guess he doesn't
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to share so i will ask
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
aiden moore to
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
go through um the amendment and uh
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
and be able to answer any specific
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody might have
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
so you are you're on a oh look at that
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
fancy library
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
path here um thank you chairman for
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
explaining that your amendment one two
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
three seven
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
lies on top of senator gannon's
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
amendment zero seven four five which i
 
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
amendment zero seven four five which i
think

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
will help in case anyone has any
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
if these parts need to be looked at in a
 
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.349 align:start position:0%
if these parts need to be looked at in a
whole

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
as in the whole fashion um
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
on the amendment your amendment one two
 
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.270 align:start position:0%
on the amendment your amendment one two
three

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
seven uh mr chairman hud um
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking at page three excuse me
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
line three where we now have established
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
a new provision in statute
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
called the direct to consumer shipments
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
of alcohol
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
now to have this make any sense
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee you need to
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
know that rsa 178 27
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
is the direct shipping statute and we
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about trying to
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
fit the ability for
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
licensees in new hampshire to send
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
products to
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire consumers by amending
 
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.349 align:start position:0%
new hampshire consumers by amending
178.27

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
178.27
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that didn't really make it make much
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
sense it would it would have created
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
some type of a
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
colossus statute and so therefore the
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
approach that we took was to
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
take the pieces out of 178.27
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
and i forget which representative asked
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
of why the i think it might have been
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
who was asking the question about
 
00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
who was asking the question about
reporting

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
and keeping names etc and
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
what you see in this provision
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
which starts and ends
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
on page 2 line 16
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
is is essentially an incorporation of
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
much of the language from 178.27
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
into this new statute all the reporting
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirements all the
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
packaging requirements all the signature
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that exist
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the law which applies to businesses
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.190 align:start position:0%
in the law which applies to businesses
who

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
are existing out of state and ship into
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
would now apply to businesses located in
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
shipping to new hampshire consumers so
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
we've we've brought all those pieces
 
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
we've we've brought all those pieces
across

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
often times when legislation and alcohol
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
is introduced there are questions about
 
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.710 align:start position:0%
is introduced there are questions about
parity

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
parity
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
and is is is it equal
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so therefore what we've proposed
 
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.589 align:start position:0%
and so therefore what we've proposed
here

00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
in this amendment is to bring all the
 
00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.270 align:start position:0%
in this amendment is to bring all the
limitations

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i think in the executive
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
summary you see the limitations on
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
quantity and
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
those quantity limitations which exist
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
in the direct shipping law
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
have also been brought across and
 
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.589 align:start position:0%
have also been brought across and
applied

00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
in the direct-to-consumer piece that's
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
being proposed
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
in the 178-27b section
 
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.589 align:start position:0%
in the 178-27b section
[Music]

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
so with that i guess mr chairman
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
i if you'd like i can pause and take any
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions from members about this
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
particular piece
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
um or just wait to the end um
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that's we'll say any questions
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
so uh representative bartlett did you
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
i do and i'm sorry to interrupt but um i
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
was looking at the executive summary
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and mr moore it it refers to
 
00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
um and mr moore it it refers to
amendment

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
um 1191 but the
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're looking at is 12 37
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
correct that that's correct and i think
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
the that's
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
part of the flurry of emails i sent this
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
morning which i the last one you
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
received from me was the correct one and
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
i apologize for
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
any inconvenience i've caused you i'm
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
sorry then i
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'll go back and and print it out sorry
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay my apologies ma'am
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes yeah there wasn't wasn't a big
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
change between the two
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representative burroughs
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes mr moore thanks for taking my
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
question um i understand what you're
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying about parity between
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
out of state and and the in-state um
 
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.270 align:start position:0%
out of state and and the in-state um
shipping

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
my question is i'm i'm i'm i'm just kind
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
of trying to understand
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
why the limitations of say 60 individual
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
containers in a calendar year
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
because i'm thinking of a scenario where
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
somebody's having a home wedding
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
um which is pretty common and that
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a lot of liquor if
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
you're having
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
over 100 people for for a home wedding
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
oh thanks for your question
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative i i think
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing in this amendment is
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
a a gap filler there's there's no
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
limitation on the
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
person that you've described in your in
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
your scenario
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
who can go to uh for example a
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
purchase as much as they wish they could
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
go to a beverage wholesaler
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
versus purchase as much as they wish
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment 0745
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
from senator gannon we've removed
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
the limitations that were imposed upon a
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
which up to this point in time was
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
limited to selling an individual case or
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
a 15.5 gallon
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
keg that's been removed in the bill
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
so we've essentially stripped the
 
00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:38.829 align:start position:0%
so we've essentially stripped the
limitations

00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
away and and if you think of
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
178 27b as really
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
rounding out the entire process this
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
this was kind of an area that was really
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
not touched uh mr dumas and his members
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
could deliver any of one of his members
 
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.710 align:start position:0%
could deliver any of one of his members
can

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh deliver to a consumer and and has
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
had that ability and to just kind of
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
reference who this applies to if you
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
look on page one of the amendment
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
lines five and six that
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
this direct-to-consumer piece is really
 
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
this direct-to-consumer piece is really
now

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
applicable to manufacturers nano brewers
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
brew pubs wine manufacturers liquor
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and beverage distributors
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
so these are the class of licensees now
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
who will be allowed to
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
proceed to ship directly to consumers
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
following the provisions below regarding
 
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.750 align:start position:0%
following the provisions below regarding
the

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
time place and manner that this is
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
so i i hope i hope i've answered your
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
question representative if not i'll be
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
happy to try
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
to do it again um yeah i don't i don't
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to belabor it but i'm just
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
again i'm still struggling to understand
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
i understand that it's okay
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i i can answer this question
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is very simple actually and
 
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
the answer is very simple actually and
and

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
and aiden was probably would not if he
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
want to say this but
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
this was the political compromise for me
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
to get the direct shipping pass
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't you know the liquor
 
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.430 align:start position:0%
because we don't you know the liquor
commission

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't want you to be buying wine
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
directly from california
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
they want you to come to our liquor
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
stores and and buy it from us
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
so the issue was at how much can they
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
ship to you as the consumer and
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
and and be reasonable you know not not
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
dent in our overall revenue source which
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
is the liquor commission
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
so these numbers were are set really
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
where was that it was a balancing add to
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
how much is appropriate how much is
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
enough yeah it is true if you plan to
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
have a big old wedding
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
and you want to have certain beer that
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
get in new hampshire um and you want to
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
take advantage of you know the 60 year
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
i guess you would just have to have
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
family members somebody else also
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
with a different address also order it
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
so enough you order
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
definitely maybe you can get enough but
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
the idea was that we didn't want
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't want any any outside
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer outside the state and to
 
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.109 align:start position:0%
manufacturer outside the state and to
think

00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
that this is an opportunity to bypass
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
their our distribution system or our
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the real thank you
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
that makes total sense now thank you
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative mcaleer
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i'm i'm looking
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't see anything maybe i'm
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
missing it about
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire brewers etc shipping
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's potential that's exactly what
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
this section is
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh is is this intra state shipment is uh
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
which well actually put this away the
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
is is uh limit is currently
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
being used by beverage manufacturers
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
so a beverage manufacturer right now can
 
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
so a beverage manufacturer right now can
ship

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
ship
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
beer or anything out of state
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that's using the direct shipping law
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
with this statue
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
is what you're seeing here is just
 
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.349 align:start position:0%
is what you're seeing here is just
interstate

00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
and that that was a uh you know uh i
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
guess you could say a loophole
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
but that um and but we could have just
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
simply said okay fine we'll allow them
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
be this in the same direct shipping law
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
but then i didn't really want double
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
taxation i mean i
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
i want be able to if a new hampshire
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
citizen to be able to
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
get beer or get a wine or beer having
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
shipped to them and not have to pay the
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
eight percent tax
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
so but the question you're asking is can
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
they now ship out of state
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
and yes they can but that's in the
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
direct shipping law which is not
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's not in this bill
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
my point is can they ship more out of
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
state than they can ship
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
interstate there's no limitation
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
mr chairman may i follow up with that
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes the the representative mclear the
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
the businesses in new hampshire can ship
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
out of state so long as they
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh follow the requirements in those
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
existing states to which they ship
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
who may have their own the other state
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's the problem similar
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
so for example while we have rsa 178 27
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
for businesses who
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
ship into new hampshire other states may
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
have similar legislation
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
prescribing how a business located
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
outside of their
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
state lines what they must do
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
to ship to consumers within their state
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
so this is a this is a state by state
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
issue and our direct shipping
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
really only addresses people shipping
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
within into the state
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
and 178 27 b
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
kind of rounds out that piece as it
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
relates to businesses
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right great
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative emman uh thank you mr
 
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh representative emman uh thank you mr
chair

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you uh mr moore for taking
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
our questions and
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
listening to our concerns um
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised to hear uh that the state
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
is collecting
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
names and addresses of people receiving
 
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
names and addresses of people receiving
shipments

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
shipments
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
and you know thinking about privacy
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
aspect of this
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
i understand that it might be uh a way
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
to enforce this
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
60 container limit is that correct no
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
the enforce a is that the person is
 
00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
the enforce a is that the person is
actually

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
who the person is who's getting it and
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that they really
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
are over 21
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
but more importantly we also want to
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that the tax is getting paid
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we actually get this information also
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
from ups fedex
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
when they deliver it they're going gonna
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
they'll report back to us
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
so we can match up that with the
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
corp the businesses who are collecting
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
the eight percent so we can make sure
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
that the eight percent actually got
 
00:50:07.359 --> 00:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
that the eight percent actually got
collected

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
will you follow up yes follow further
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
question inquire so
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
what what data exactly is collected how
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
is it stored
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
what's the security around it and how is
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh well we don't have any credit card
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
numbers all we would have
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the person's name and address but i
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know hayden do we know how the
 
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.069 align:start position:0%
i don't know hayden do we know how the
the

00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
security is transactional information is
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
really between the consumer
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
and the licensee so we don't keep
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
that as representative fund indicated
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
this is information is requested to
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
provide us with an opportunity to
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
investigate if we need to
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
on enforcing for example the limits so
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh direct shipping 178.27
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh imposes limits and imposes a tax as
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative hunt said
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
so if if we were finding that businesses
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
were shipping into the state
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
there are two concerns first are they
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
paying us what their
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
oh what we what we are owed based upon
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
these transactions
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
and secondly by the numbers that are
 
00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:20.549 align:start position:0%
and secondly by the numbers that are
involved

00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
there are provisions in 178.27 that tell
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
as chairman hunt said we want consumers
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to buy from the state
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
but if there's a product that they can't
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
get that is shipped into the state
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
these uh limitations are imposed to
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
essentially say to the commission
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um hey you know we didn't know that this
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
was going to be that popular
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
so if you're shipping enough of it into
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
the state that it's creating a demand
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
then you need to sell it to us too and
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
now we're going to put it on our shelves
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
so that is kind of a hook in there to
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
to allow the businesses to ship in but
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
also to give the commission the
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to acquire the product to
 
00:52:06.319 --> 00:52:06.710 align:start position:0%
opportunity to acquire the product to
sell

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
yes so so in order to
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to police the businesses
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
you're surreptitiously collecting data
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
on private citizens
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm hearing you saying it
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be stereotypicious because we
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
asking them for the information if there
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
wer if there was an inkling that there
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
was a problem going on you're asking the
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
business the consumer doesn't know
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
the data is being collected and i'm
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
assuming it's being stored in some kind
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
of database that you could search later
 
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.069 align:start position:0%
of database that you could search later
right

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct no well no there would
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
be the business has it it would be
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
the commission would then is requiring
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
them to hold on to that information so
 
00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
them to hold on to that information so
that

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
the commission can ask for it if they um
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
if they need to do an audit or some have
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
have some reason to
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
investigate i mean this is what you know
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
so it is it's you know we don't we're
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
not getting it automatically
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're not that that would we
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
certainly our computers would never be
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
able to handle that
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
now we're we we're only using upon
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
requests if there was an issue
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
situation audited and you know that and
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
but like you say that they
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
the deal the other thing that aiden
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out was really important to the
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
liquor commission was
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't want you know
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
like opus one
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know to suddenly say well because we
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
only sell so much of it
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll sell it directly we'll bypass the
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
liquor commission completely
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
and that that that they didn't that
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
that defeat the whole purpose of the
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
bill which was was not was was supposed
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
to find things that
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
not people that we didn't know we we
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know that people want
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so therefore this is a way to test
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
market and see if there is an interest
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
in the product and if there is
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
then of course we want the commission to
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
be able to get it so one last follow-up
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
i know this is my
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
my fourth or fifth is that okay yeah
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's fine
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh so how do they know how does the
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
know the demand for a product they're
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
not carrying
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
if they're not accessing that data
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're getting a report from fedex and
 
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.270 align:start position:0%
we're getting a report from fedex and
ups

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
ups
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have the names and addresses
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
on it they're telling us what they're
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
what they're delivering
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
we get i think we get the invoices don't
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
we we get the inventory
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
the the direct shippers are required to
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
file a monthly report
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
um as is required here in the amendment
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
for 17827b
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
where they would file monthly and tell
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
who they're shipping to in new hampshire
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the limitations are again imposed
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
largely for the commercial purposes of
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not this is a
 
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not this is a
product

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
the commission wants to put on its
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
shelves if it doesn't have it on it now
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
so monthly you're getting names and
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
addresses of
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
from every shipper for everything they
 
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:53.750 align:start position:0%
from every shipper for everything they
ship

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
ship
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they're supposed to report
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
to the commission that's correct
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
so if you don't want pers you don't want
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
anybody to know that don't
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
buy don't don't buy up the internet
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
anyways right so my initial supposition
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
was correct
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
yes i would say yes now that i now i
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
hear that i i would say you're
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're correct that yes we actually have
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
the names and addresses to all those new
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
so that means neil kirk mr privacy
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
because i know
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
he'd like to buy the wine you know off
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
the new york times or the the wall
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
street journal
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
so yes that we would have their names
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
and names and addresses
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is true so
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
if you if you want privacy don't don't
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
order to the through the mail
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't internet so
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative uh let's see uh
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
greece in your this is new for you to
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman i guess it
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
goes to the to the privacy issue there
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to add something
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
into the bill that says that the
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner has to destroy the
 
00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:02.549 align:start position:0%
commissioner has to destroy the
information

00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
after it's verified that taxes have been
 
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.309 align:start position:0%
after it's verified that taxes have been
collected

00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
um i i would assume that they they would
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
destroy the evidence after
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
what if they wouldn't call this habit
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
they would destroy this data after a
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
certain point in time but
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can find that out right aidan we can
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
find out how long we'll hold on to that
 
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
find out how long we'll hold on to that
information

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
oh yes yes we can so we we get that for
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
you but i i mean i'm
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they're not stacking it all in
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
warehouses well you know
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
intentionally that would be it it's it's
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
computerized so it would be
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
well i i can't say it's computerized
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
because not all of the alcohol industry
 
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
because not all of the alcohol industry
is

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
computerized so we may get faxes we may
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
get emails
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
but that information is compiled by the
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
commission's examiner unit
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of um doing a
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
comparison to ensure the revenues are
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay so you all said jeff
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
i guess so i guess i live under the fear
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
of my principle still having my
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
record as a kid but i guess not i i like
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
best advice
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
is if you're if you're worried about
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
that your name and address being
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere i would not be buying anything
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
off the internet
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand that but if we just
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
put a clause in there that they have to
 
00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:14.470 align:start position:0%
put a clause in there that they have to
to

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
destroy it after sorry but let's find
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
out let's find out how long they hold on
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're not muted chris so it's obviously
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
your volume or where's your microphone
 
00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:42.710 align:start position:0%
your volume or where's your microphone
or

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
would you please his earpiece doesn't
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
look like he has a microphone in it
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
which might be the problem
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
does he have an earpiece oh yeah i guess
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
you got headphones on there
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
chris yeah so unplug those things
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:58:03.190 align:start position:0%
chris yeah so unplug those things
unplugged

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
does this make a difference yes now it
 
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.230 align:start position:0%
does this make a difference yes now it
works

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay that's absolutely what it was it's
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
a problem you have no microphone in your
 
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.150 align:start position:0%
a problem you have no microphone in your
headset

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
headset
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh the reason i uh i'm i'm uh
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
talking is the issue of
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
the shippers giving information to
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
the state in regards to is it just
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
liquor shipments or is it every shipment
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
thicker yeah this is just liquor okay so
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'd well you would say liquor it's a
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
beer and wine i don't know what you mean
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
by well alcohol i
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
i just uh the way it was stated is
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
almost as though
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
fedex and ups had to give you their
 
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
fedex and ups had to give you their
daily

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
daily
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
shipment whatever and i'm going well
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's nuts
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
all we care about is alcohol well yeah i
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
all right representing back later um
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
just thank you uh
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
mr moore how often are these violations
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
of how commonplace
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
we are constantly looking to make sure
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
the revenues provided by the
 
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.470 align:start position:0%
the revenues provided by the
out-of-state

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
direct shippers are
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
where they're supposed to be um and
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
because i think there are over a
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
thousand direct shippers that are
 
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:32.309 align:start position:0%
thousand direct shippers that are
currently

00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
licensed and authorized to ship into new
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire you can well imagine
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and especially those who are
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
relatively small
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
don't ship a lot of quantity might say
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to skip this we're not going
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
to we're not going to identify this so
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
we're in a constant process of of
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
checking so actual violations
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense that um let's say for
 
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
in the sense that um let's say for
example

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
the aside from the revenue piece the
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
other consideration
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
are that alcohol is shipped to people
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
who are of appropriate
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
age and so therefore
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
our enforcement unit will periodically
 
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
our enforcement unit will periodically
audit

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
those records to make sure that the
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol is being properly shipped
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
to those consumers who are of 21 or
 
01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:21.030 align:start position:0%
to those consumers who are of 21 or
older

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
older
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so i can't give you a
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
precise number of how many
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
violations occur each year sir but i can
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
it is uh regularly monitored
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the businesses who are
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
licensed aren't compliant
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
and uh i do have some information mr
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
chairman that
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
the direct the shipping information
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's provided
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
is kept for the current uh year
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
plus one in house and then those records
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
then go to uh
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
archives uh state archives for five
 
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
archives uh state archives for five
years

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.309 align:start position:0%
years
okay

01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
all right uh any other
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions all right so we're on to
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um section two
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the amendment 12
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
on page two it's number six on line 20.
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
and in this it uh
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
as the chairman explained the the
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
sampling piece here is not the new piece
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
the new piece
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that uh under this amendment
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
provision a beverage
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer would be allowed for a fee
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
of 336 dollars to acquire
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
a single
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer retail outlet
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
so with that and at the
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer's retail outlet
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
the consumer who came in to visit
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
could have a sample the sample of their
 
01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.029 align:start position:0%
could have a sample the sample of their
product

01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
could be a four ounce sample per
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
label it could be a single
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
16 ounce pint of their product
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
and if the location were to provide
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
food then they could have a second
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
16 ounce pint as a part of their
 
01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
16 ounce pint as a part of their
sampling

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
sampling
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturer would only be
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
their products they could not sell
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
products from any other business
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the food that is provided could come
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
and be made in-house or it could be
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
purchased from
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
another source and made available
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to allow consumers to
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
so there is a definition
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
of what a beverage manufacturer
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
retail outlet is and
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
that exists on senator gannon's
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
amendment 745 s
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
on page 4 line 31
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
which defines a beverage manufacturer
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
retail outlet as an outlet for the sale
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
sampling production or manufacturing
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
and promotion of beverages and products
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured by the beverage
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer licensee
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the way this is written it requires
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturer who applies
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
for a beverage manufacturer retail
 
01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:43.990 align:start position:0%
for a beverage manufacturer retail
outlet

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
outlet
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
to produce beverages
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
on the facility at the facility site of
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
so there is a production requirement
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
exists in the definition
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
which would be required
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
and applied under the amendment
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%

brewpub
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
representative to to help um
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
make this as clear as i can from a
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturing and when i say
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
beverage it's
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's beer it's something called a
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
specialty beverage which
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
hasn't it's a a whole definitional issue
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
but we have essentially for the purposes
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
of beer there are three different
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
categories of license that one can
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
acquire right
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
right a beverage manufacturer license
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
which is the title
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
of that license a
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
smaller incubator type of business is a
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
nano brewery and then the third type
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
of manufacturer would be a brewpub
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
so when we speak of beverage
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer we're speaking specifically
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
of the license under rsa 178
 
01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:41.029 align:start position:0%
of the license under rsa 178
12.

01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
the businesses that hold that type of
 
01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
the businesses that hold that type of
license

01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
a nano brewer for example would hold a
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
license under 178 12
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
a so the the beverage manufacturer
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
phrase is actually term of art as
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
a term of art it has a specific meaning
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's not used generically beverage
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are defined in
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the law under rsa 178.1 excuse me 175
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
colon one
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the provisions that
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
are contained in the amendment allowing
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
for a beverage manufacturer retail
 
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.589 align:start position:0%
for a beverage manufacturer retail
outlet

01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
outlet
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
only apply to that type of business
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
so if they're going to be selling food
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
um will they need to get a license from
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
the department of health if they're
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to sell it
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
um yes i mean we're we're looking at
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
this for example that the
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh third-party vendor who sells them has
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
to be a properly licensed vendor
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
so if uh i'll try to use this
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh explain us through an example uh i'm
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
a beverage i'm manufacturer abc i take
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
advantage of this
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity i pay my 336 dollars
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
i go and find a location for my retail
 
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
i go and find a location for my retail
outlet

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
outlet
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
i open it up i have production capacity
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh initially i decide i want to do four
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
ounce samples
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
which they can do they can give it away
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
as the chairman mentioned
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
or sell it if they decide i want to
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
do pints as well well they could do that
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
if they decide they want to go further
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
into the sense of providing a second
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
16 ounce beverage then they have to
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
provide food
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that goes to the discussion that the
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
chairman had with you all about
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh the importance of food in the process
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
and that it's important to try to
 
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
and that it's important to try to
prevent

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
over service and that food oftentimes
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
tempers the effects of alcohol so
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the food that they provide can be
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
produced by them
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
and if so depending upon the type of
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
food that they offer
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
if they make it there then they would
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
have to require
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
and comply with the health requirements
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
for that community
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
if it's pre-packaged then they probably
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
would not
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
um but they could also acquire their
 
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.309 align:start position:0%
um but they could also acquire their
products

01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
for example from a third party so maybe
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
caterer down the street who they have
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
developed a rapport with who says i'd
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to sell my stuff here and
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
then if if that goes over well they can
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
come down the street and buy it from me
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
so there's an opportunity here for
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
for the business to sell products that
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
are already produced
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
outside of their facility or produced
 
01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.789 align:start position:0%
outside of their facility or produced
inside

01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
inside
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
or prepackaged materials
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
wow okay
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
all right representative johnson do you
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm i'm just trying i'm new to
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for taking my
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
question so i'm just trying to wrap my
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
head around all of this
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
i've been listening so intently so my
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
so if i am a buisso example
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
let somebody put my beer out there i can
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
only let
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
one retail outlet sell my beer i can't
 
01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
one retail outlet sell my beer i can't

01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
no okay you can you can have anybody
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
anybody who's an
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh off-premise licensee can sell your
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
beer for you
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
what this is you want to own
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
that location okay and the three-tier
 
01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
that location okay and the three-tier
remember

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
the magic of the three-tier for what it
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
was worth was you that was these chinese
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
walls between
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing distribution and retail
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
and how it's sold so what that this is a
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know slight trampling of the system
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
which we're going to say
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
if you're a manufacturer you can
 
01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:02.070 align:start position:0%
if you're a manufacturer you can
actually

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
own a retail location an off-premise
 
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
own a retail location an off-premise
license

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
and uh but that you know they're
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
obviously if you have food you're going
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
to have to make sure that you know the
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
food is
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
whoever's providing the food or whatever
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're doing is properly licensed in
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
that town whatever the zoning is in that
 
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.470 align:start position:0%
that town whatever the zoning is in that
town

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
about that food but no you can sell your
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
beer to anybody
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's if you want to own that satellite
 
01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:26.229 align:start position:0%
it's if you want to own that satellite
location

01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was i was getting
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%

is that is the nuts and bolts the guts
 
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.790 align:start position:0%
is that is the nuts and bolts the guts
around

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
having those licensees who are listed
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
there shipped directly
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire consumers this
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
particular section
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
would now enable a business
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh it creates a business opportunity
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
quite frankly for anyone who might want
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
to engage in this
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
but it does require that the shipment
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is made to the consumer
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
be made by a licensed carrier
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
the commission issues a carrier's
 
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:37.990 align:start position:0%
the commission issues a carrier's
license

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i guess most commonly you might look
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
at it from the standpoint of
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you see the beer trucks going down
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
each of those beer trucks is issued a
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
carrier's license
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
from the liquor commission um so
 
01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.149 align:start position:0%
from the liquor commission um so
therefore

01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
the decision was made that
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
for the businesses who choose to engage
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
direct to consumer shipping within the
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
state must
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
do so by using a licensed carrier
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay and they're all pretty much used to
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
that anyways because if they were doing
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
um self distribution they would have
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
already had the number
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
already gotten registered their vehicles
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
right sure correct
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay any questions there
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
all right that's an easy one um the next
 
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:30.870 align:start position:0%
all right that's an easy one um the next
issue

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
is uh on page three number nine
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
and you'll see this is a new provision
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
which is not
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the amendment 745 s
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
um this changes and expands the
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
definition of a beverage
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
um this is a very
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
convoluted area um and
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
one that has seen uh
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
revision probably uh over the last few
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
years almost every year
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
static issues that existed within the
 
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
static issues that existed within the
law

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
obviously as legislators you create a
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
law it's a snapshot in time it
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
addresses an issue as it exists today
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
businesses who are in the process of
 
01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.350 align:start position:0%
businesses who are in the process of
manufacturing

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
beverages wine liquor beer
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
are constantly experimenting
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
developing new products new methods of
 
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
developing new products new methods of
manufacturing

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
and it's somewhat difficult for the
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
laws to keep up with the businesses that
 
01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
laws to keep up with the businesses that
are

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the business of producing alcohol so
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
this change is uh brought about
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
by a change in the manufacturing process
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh where manufacturers now are producing
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
a beverage not necessarily
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
um using the traditional
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
malt products but fermenting it or
 
01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
malt products but fermenting it or
brewing

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
brewing
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
these products now with other
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
ingredients such as
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
sugar this change
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
will now allow those products which up
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
to this point in time have not been
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for the new hampshire
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
marketplace to come in
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
and these products would come to the
 
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.669 align:start position:0%
and these products would come to the
retailer

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire consumer by means
 
01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:26.870 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire consumer by means
of

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire beverage wholesalers so
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's how the product would come in
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
the vendor would sell it and and again
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
this applies to
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
any of our licensees who are eligible to
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
produce this so it's not necessarily
 
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
produce this so it's not necessarily
just

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
people who are exist out of state this
 
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
people who are exist out of state this
is

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh applies to our new hampshire beverage
 
01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.149 align:start position:0%
uh applies to our new hampshire beverage
manufacturer

01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
it applies to the nano brewer it applies
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
to the brew pub
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
all of them now are able to produce
 
01:14:57.199 --> 01:14:58.470 align:start position:0%
all of them now are able to produce
products

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
based on this definition and get them
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh either by self-distribution or moving
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
them to the beverage wholesaler
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
that may be a little more convoluted
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's almost as common as a definition
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay we have
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
we have two different tax rates out
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
there and we have
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the the beer tax which is 30 cents a
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
gallon and then we have those things
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
that are distilled
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh or wine based that uh potentially
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
are are five percent of the wholesale
 
01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
are are five percent of the wholesale
price

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so what we're having is a this is a
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
particular product
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a spritzer and um it
 
01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.189 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a spritzer and um it
basically

01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
they we already did it with mike's hard
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
lemonade well we went to the eight
 
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.270 align:start position:0%
lemonade well we went to the eight
percent

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
so this is a spritzer that's now going
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
to eight percent um
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
it theoretically could have been treated
 
01:15:59.440 --> 01:15:59.830 align:start position:0%
it theoretically could have been treated
as

01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
a as a sort of as a distilled uh type
 
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.270 align:start position:0%
a as a sort of as a distilled uh type
product

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is we're expanding
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
our definition of
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
exactly who is under the eight percent
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
who you know
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
is originally was just flavored malt
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
beverages and we thought we were all set
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
with the malls
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
but it turns out that there's always a
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
new way to
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
mix up something and so this is going to
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
help address that
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
but just keeps the channels consistent
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
to what we have right now in terms of
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
the the beer distributors uh this is the
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
product that the beer distributors can
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
distribute at the 30 cents a gallon
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
rather than worried about the five
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
percent tax
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
so any questions on this one so this is
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
this piece is part of the reason why
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
this i'm calling this a non-germain
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
hearing because
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
this was not and really in the bills but
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
it really is also the same
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
subject of what we're trying to do here
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is to get more product in the
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
hands of
 
01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.270 align:start position:0%
hands of
retailers

01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
okay on to the next section thank you mr
 
01:16:58.719 --> 01:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
okay on to the next section thank you mr
chairman

01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
on page three line twenty
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
number ten uh as as the chairman
 
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
number ten uh as as the chairman
mentioned

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
um in the discussion earlier
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
the sampling issue has kind of evolved
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
and he did a very nice job of describing
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
one of the this bill this section
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
proposes to
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
provide nano brewers with the same
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
privileges that
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
if you recall the beverage manufacturer
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
can serve either
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
four ounce samples or a 16 ounce pint
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
if they wish then to serve a second
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
16 ounce pint they must have food
 
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.709 align:start position:0%
16 ounce pint they must have food
available

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
nano brewers under the current law
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
are limited to four ounce samples only
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
and this amendment would propose to
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
change that so that
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
all of the manufacturers would be able
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
to serve the same
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
and that's right four and five
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
um this would be lines 20 through 25.
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay and the last piece mr chairman
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
is line 26 number 11.
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
um under the direct shipping
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
provisions of 178.27
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman i think
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
represented herbert do you have a
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
question on a previous section
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir um just to
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
clarify the uh under the same conditions
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh chairman hunt uh said uh parody
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm wondering is there a uh
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
i mean in the restaurant business
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's like what that 10 percent rule
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh you have to have so much uh food if
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're selling food
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh per um
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know it it's it's a rule you have to
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
have the food there at 10
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
or more so is that is that the measure
 
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
or more so is that is that the measure
10

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about here uh no sir
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay um a a nano brewer
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
has a couple of options they under the
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
they can serve four ounce samples to
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
consumers who come in
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
try their product and
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to then uh allow the
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
consumer to sit down
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
and consume alcohol just like they would
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
in any other facility
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
they have to acquire a
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
another license which is built into
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
their statute
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
that gives them the eligibility to apply
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
for a license under 178.20 which is a
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant license that serves
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
beer and wine and if they acquire that
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
for 240 which is half the price
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
of any other business that were to
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
acquire that license
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
then they could now sell
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
um with food
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
with with the um
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
anything that would could be considered
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
food uh
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
a products to their consumer so
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
what rather than we've kind of
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
introduced in this particular section
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
that middle ground which would allow a
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
nano brewer to say
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not ready to acquire i
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily want to get into the
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
food area but i still want people to be
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
able to have that experience of sitting
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
down drinking a pint
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and maybe even a second pint so
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
with this change they would be allowed
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
to do that moving forward
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to have that person have
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
a third pint
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
then they would still need to acquire
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
that license under 178.20
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve that uh result
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of incremental
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
depending upon where they see their
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
business going how they want their
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
business to evolve
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
if they want to just provide samples
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
they can do that
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
if they want to create more of a
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
sit-down experience where someone can
 
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.510 align:start position:0%
sit-down experience where someone can
have

01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
one maybe two then food needs to be
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
present and if they really want to
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
create that
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
pub type environment then they can
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
acquire that restaurant license under
 
01:21:45.239 --> 01:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
acquire that restaurant license under
178.20

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
178.20
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me which would allow them to
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
operate as any other restaurant would
 
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.910 align:start position:0%
operate as any other restaurant would
operate

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
so if they acquired that other license
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
they would
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry further question chairman
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
so um i haven't heard you say anything
 
01:22:05.199 --> 01:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
so um i haven't heard you say anything
about

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
a ratio of food to alcohol
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
and that's does that not exist
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
that does not exist sir um if
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
if you in way back when uh
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
i it did um i i
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
first came to work for the commission
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
1981 and uh
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
that existed at that time uh
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are obligated to sell
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
any type of
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh limit are subject to limitations
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
are licenses that licensees that sell
 
01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.629 align:start position:0%
are licenses that licensees that sell
liquor

01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
so they need to be able to sell
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate to the commission
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
annually that they sell
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
seventy five thousand dollars worth of
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
food to be eligible to hold a license
 
01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:52.629 align:start position:0%
food to be eligible to hold a license
that

01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
correct but but there is but there is no
 
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.189 align:start position:0%
correct but but there is but there is no
ratio

01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
in the law and hasn't been for something
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
right okay joel joel winters and if you
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
remember joel winters he sponsored that
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
fix that problem many many moons ago
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay last but not least
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman the last piece
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
is to repeal
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
a limitation that existed in the law for
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
direct shippers
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
under 178.27 and again direct shippers
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
are those who businesses license who
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
exist out of state who are shipping in
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and in the law there was a limitation
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
that prevented these out-of-state
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
shippers from shipping
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
beer to new hampshire licensees
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
and this amendment changes that
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
and allows now
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
these licensees to order beer
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
from out-of-state direct shippers if
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
they want to maybe there's a product
 
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.669 align:start position:0%
they want to maybe there's a product
that

01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
they can't get in new hampshire that
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
exists out of state they could order it
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
so this this would be removing the
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
limitation that exists now
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
and allowing licensees to be able to
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
purchase out of state just as any
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
consumer would
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
with the limitations with the
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
all right um great thank you very much
 
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.270 align:start position:0%
all right um great thank you very much
aidan

01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
aidan
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
um so just to wrap up everyone um one of
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
the things i have also been kind of
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know thinking about is uh we have
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
another liquor bill
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
that has two items in it that's also
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
in this bill as it came over from the
 
01:24:54.159 --> 01:24:55.030 align:start position:0%
in this bill as it came over from the
senate

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what's that other senate
 
01:24:57.679 --> 01:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what's that other senate
bill

01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the uh one amendment one zero seven
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
four five s
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
no no i'm saying the um the other senate
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
bill that's got the has the dollar oh
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry eighteen i believe
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
so that has the doggies but it also has
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
these other two sections already in this
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill which is the
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
um uh tenant tenant brewer and the
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
contract brewing for uh excuse me uh mr
 
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
contract brewing for uh excuse me uh mr
chairs

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 17 i believe 17. okay so
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
that bill has the the other two issues
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the contract brew
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
and the tenant brew are in this bill so
 
01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:35.030 align:start position:0%
and the tenant brew are in this bill so
i'm

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to point out to think
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
that the doggy issue
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we have seen the ends of
 
01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:41.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we have seen the ends of
dogs

01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
and this it's really um there's all
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of things out
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
my attitude would be is that bill we
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
would just uh retain that bill
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
so that the liquor committee can talk
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
about dogs until they're blue in their
 
01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.030 align:start position:0%
about dogs until they're blue in their
face

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
face
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
and then um and then we'll just make
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
sure that both the tenant and
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the contract is also still in this
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
build and we'll leave it right in there
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and that way this can be our omnibus
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
liquor bill for this session so which
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the senate will just love
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
but all right other than that anybody
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
have any other questions so um
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
based upon a little bit of a survey we
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
had here it sounds like people are a
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
little busy in the first couple of days
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
of next week
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to aim thinking that i'm
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
going to have a exec session on
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
thursday does anybody have a problem
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
with doing
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
thursdays will the senators don't need
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
to see see
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
what we're doing they'll be busy having
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
their own session so they don't need to
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
see us
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
so um i will so uh stay tuned for
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
getting that notice
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and we'll go go from there uh yes
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative abramson um i'm fine with
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh thursday but
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm working on an amendment or i'm
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
having legislative services work on an
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
amendment for senate bill
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
97 uh and i don't know what the language
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be for that
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh they said that they were going to try
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
and get it over to today but i don't
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
have it yet
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
um so as soon as i have it i'll send it
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
out um
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh to the rest of the committee members
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be great
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh and then i do have a hint okay try
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
there she is hi kate good morning kay
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yes we can um i'm
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
sorry i signed up earlier to testify so
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
did not see that sorry okay um sorry
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
so i guess i i i had testimony
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
planned and i am so confused by the
 
01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
planned and i am so confused by the
description

01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
description
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
by um mr moore of this amendment
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
that i just have more questions and i
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
guess my first question is
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
what amendment are we working from
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
because the one that was posted in the
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
general court website was
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
1237 h do i understand that is correct
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
that is the number okay it is the same
 
01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
that is the number okay it is the same
one

01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like mr moore made
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
additional changes
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
no what happened was there was a a
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
mistake that was made
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so the previous number was 1191
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
that so members had seen that that was
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
not made to the public and no you never
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
saw that one so
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
but 37 is the one where we're looking at
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
so the way i understand it now is that
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
it completely changes the direct
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
shipping law
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
and now i'm reading it in a very
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
different context than i was before so a
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
couple questions i have there was a fee
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
previously and it looks like there's no
 
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
previously and it looks like there's no
longer

01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
in fact it says there won't be a fee um
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
going forward um is that
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
is that because what we're doing is
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're creating a new entity called
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh direct to the consumer
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
and um this might be confusing but we'll
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
just simply the best way we can describe
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
it is the direct shipper
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
is um for anybody who is not
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
licensed in new hampshire but is selling
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol outside of the state
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the direct shipping law was
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
and yes there was the eight percent tax
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
this section this direct to the consumer
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
is only for new hampshire licensees and
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire licensees
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
they can ship directly to a consumer
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
they're already paying their taxes
 
01:29:33.199 --> 01:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
they're already paying their taxes
whatever

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
if it's 30 cents a gallon or you know
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
wine the five percent
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
so they're already paying the tax so
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
there's no need for us to collect
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
another tax
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
and this is only for new hampshire
 
01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.390 align:start position:0%
and this is only for new hampshire
licensees

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
who are shipping to new hampshire
 
01:29:46.159 --> 01:29:47.590 align:start position:0%
who are shipping to new hampshire
citizens

01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.270 align:start position:0%
citizens
i

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're understand going to double tax
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
but it isn't everything
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not double taxing nobody isn't there
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
a fee for the out of state
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't license them okay so
 
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:03.910 align:start position:0%
because we don't license them okay so
these

01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
there but there's already licensed all
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
these people
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay currently okay um
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
all right so the other question i have i
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
got really confused about the discussion
 
01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:15.270 align:start position:0%
got really confused about the discussion
of

01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
tracking um names and all of that
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and the concern around that and so i
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
pulled out the form
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
and it looks like now the liquor
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't even
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
require um
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh shipment reports are no longer
 
01:30:34.239 --> 01:30:35.590 align:start position:0%
uh shipment reports are no longer
required

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
when you apply for a direct shipper
 
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.270 align:start position:0%
when you apply for a direct shipper
license

01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm wondering how you can even
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
figure any of this information out
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
if these reports are now saying you
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
don't even need to send a shipment
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
report you just need to put in the
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
um approximate the cost okay
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so i i'm pretty sure aidan's not
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
answer that question but i know mark
 
01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.709 align:start position:0%
answer that question but i know mark
armageddon

01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
armageddon
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
is on and he hears that question
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
and um and i'll make sure that mark
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
follows up and we get an answer to that
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
for you so i mean the question it would
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
be there is how would you even track
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
the tax at this point because you don't
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
even you're not even listing it out
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah what form are you looking at do you
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
have i'm looking at the one right on the
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
website when you look up direct shipping
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
it says direct shipper form and in
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
red says very clearly
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
shipment reports are no longer required
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay i will we'll get an answer for you
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's going to be a big
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
question because
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know how do you even estimate it at
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
this point um
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the let's see the other question i have
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that this
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
is a new basically i understand what
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do but it's somewhat of
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
a new licensing category with therefore
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
more demands
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
so regarding the compliance checks that
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it's somewhat limited because it's
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
does the liquor commission have enough
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh staff and resources to
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
um do the compliance check now that
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
basically it's open to anyone in new
 
01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.149 align:start position:0%
basically it's open to anyone in new
hampshire

01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
you'll have to ask the senate finance
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
and health finance how they're
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
how they want to get rid of all those
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
auditors all the enforcement so
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
i cannot answer to that question of
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
whether you know i
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't know i mean i think that
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of i mean if they get rid of
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
the 21 positions and they're really
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to be in trouble
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
but at least as is now i'd just like to
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
know the answer if they will have
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
an additional um demand for
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement i i would say no
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
so is that the state the statement from
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's my statement i'm saying in the
 
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.709 align:start position:0%
that's my statement i'm saying in the
commission

01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
i have no doubt in my mind that the
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
commission is always going in front of
 
01:32:58.239 --> 01:32:58.950 align:start position:0%
commission is always going in front of
the

01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and say they need more
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement and they need more people
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they always say that but you
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
know that that
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's not our responsibility
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
commerce is responsibility our con we're
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of how well the departments do
 
01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.470 align:start position:0%
in terms of how well the departments do
this

01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
evidently the the our house finance
 
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
evidently the the our house finance
committee

01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
thinks that that there that uh
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
that they can be done without
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement so well i guess that breaks
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
the question answer that question i
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
can't i cannot answer that for you
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there's a revised
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
special note on that too
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
because along with that question too i
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
just wonder about the changes in the
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
taxes with the definition of the
 
01:33:38.159 --> 01:33:39.430 align:start position:0%
taxes with the definition of the
specialty

01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
um sorry with the new definition of
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer i'm not sure where
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
that came from that
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
was not in any previous discussion but
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
my question now is is this spirits as
 
01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.189 align:start position:0%
my question now is is this spirits as
well

01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
so you can um shift around
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
your um categories now because you all
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
fall under beverage what happens to the
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
specialty beverage
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
from last year and these are
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
these are i i i hear where you're going
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i understand your confusion and i
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
understand you're trying to create
 
01:34:12.159 --> 01:34:13.030 align:start position:0%
understand you're trying to create
confusion

01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
but i will have to assure you that uh
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
that that this is all well thought out
 
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.310 align:start position:0%
that that this is all well thought out
um

01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
that you know and and i can certainly
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
talk you offline
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
and help walk you through each one of
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's you know it's just
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
difficult because this
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh these amendments really haven't some
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
of these haven't been discussed at all
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and so this would just
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
be another reason to remember
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders i've absolutely
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
been here i realized that a new future
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
is a stakeholder
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
and last time i checked your your
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholder is that you're opposed to
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
so um so i'm not sure how much more i
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
can include you
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
in the process and feeling comfortable
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
with it but the whole reason i'm
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
held this hearing today and why we're
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
doing this is that that had everyone had
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
to come in and and i can assure you that
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
all stakeholders
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
barring new futures position uh are
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
are are in support of what we're doing
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
here so it wasn't
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated that way to work with the
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
it was anticipated and they were
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated and they were invited to
 
01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.070 align:start position:0%
anticipated and they were invited to
testify

01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay so if you've got if you know
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
somebody else who has a problem with
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
this build please
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
let them know contact me and i'll
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
certainly i'll hold another one if you
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
want another hearing you'll have another
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
one of these hearings we can do that if
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who needs more detail
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
more information or understanding but
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
like i said if you
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
um i mean i can see the attendees list
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know obviously i guess you can't see
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
it but
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
i pretty much everybody and anybody he
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
is he's they're there
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're all there they're all they know
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
this is happening and
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're all in in accordance with it
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
i guess my point is it's you know if
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
some people saw this
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
and got agreement before others then
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's just too bad there wasn't an
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
us to weigh in as well i think there are
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
parts of the amendment we don't have any
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
well let me pose the question to you is
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
there anything in this build this
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that you agree with
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i think as the form that i saw
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
last week i actually was feeling much
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
better about it
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
and now i saw this and it's so different
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
from the bill that was
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
um last week but we think we made it
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
better here so
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
so okay well i would just encourage the
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee to look closely at some of
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
these questions and i'll be curious to
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
get a response from the liquor
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
commission on my questions
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
fair enough uh representative anthony do
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh i do thank you mark i'm sorry i was
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
going to check this myself and and i
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
real i wanted to hear kate's
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
um kate's queries and and comments
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
because i do respect what she has to say
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh so my question is a nuts and bolts
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
question sb14 does anyone recall
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's uh senator sanders i believe it
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
was direct shipping
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
was that rolled into this and i couldn't
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
that is the separate issue because
 
01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.189 align:start position:0%
that is the separate issue because
that's

01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
direct dealing with just the liquor
 
01:36:59.119 --> 01:37:00.229 align:start position:0%
direct dealing with just the liquor
commission

01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
getting into the direct shipping and so
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have anything to do with any
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
these these okay thank you i was going
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
to check it myself as i said i
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to listen so thank you yeah fair
 
01:37:10.719 --> 01:37:11.590 align:start position:0%
wanted to listen so thank you yeah fair
enough

01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt um this is uh
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
the finance committee uh if i understand
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
you correctly
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
has basically gutted the uh
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
investigative force over at liberty
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement division yes
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division um
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
i find that very troublesome yeah i and
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
especially from a standing committee
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
that supposedly
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
is uh trying to make uh
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know laws in reference to
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh that have big revenue impacts
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know you can i can assure
 
01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know you can i can assure
you

01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
that they know that uh i have let let
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
are going down does not make any sense
 
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
to me that the enforcement plays a very
 
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.149 align:start position:0%
to me that the enforcement plays a very
important

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
role in um our making the liquor
 
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.229 align:start position:0%
role in um our making the liquor
commission

01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
work they were hanging their hat
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
on the audit um and i have a lot of
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
problems with that audit
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
and and i've pointed out to them for
 
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
and and i've pointed out to them for
example

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
one of the issues they were very
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about as they talk about
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
how um how you know some businesses
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
never have never don't get audited
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know how how can we
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
be doing this if we don't audit
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
everybody and i pointed out to them that
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
um another uh new hampshire tax you know
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
other than
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
like we have a rooms and meals tax and i
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
have been in the vacation rental
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:48.470 align:start position:0%
have been in the vacation rental
business

01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
for almost 15 years now and
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh i have never been audited so uh the
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
idea to
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the auditing department
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
because they haven't used it
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem you know doesn't make any
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
sense to me but you know that
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
is their position um and we can only
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
hope that when the bill comes
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
out you know when the one and two come
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
out of the senate
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
um this section will have been removed
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
so keep up the good work make sure they
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
put some people back in there to enforce
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
your law
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely i said to him so are you
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
going to put in more auditors you know
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
if you're going to get rid of the
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement and they said
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
they just shrugged their shoulders so i
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not you know i'm not going to get
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
into you know picking a fight with
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
another committee but
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that i my personal i
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
have let them know my personal feelings
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that they have gone down the wrong
 
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
that that they have gone down the wrong
path

01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
path
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
with this but thank you yes
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
keith did you wanna weigh in yeah i was
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
just gonna say why would you
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
why would you say publicly that you
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
well if you're not doing anything
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
illegal then there's no problem i
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
i have no need to be on it and i
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainly don't look forward to being
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
audited or having
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
it but i'm just i'm just saying that you
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
know if if audit
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
is so important to the the
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee they might be
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
questioning whether the other
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
even bigger department of revenue are
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
they doing their audits too
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
so but i don't know so i guess that
 
01:40:24.639 --> 01:40:25.109 align:start position:0%
so but i don't know so i guess that
hasn't

01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
had they haven't gone and drilled down
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals but
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
but i do think this whole thing with the
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
with the tax the same using that same
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
tax on
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
on car rental companies i think we
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
should just get rid of that tax all
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
together and
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
i think i think that the car rental tax
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
was created as a short term when our
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
time when times were tough and
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think it brings in a lot of
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
money and i think we should just
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
repeal the tax all together and that
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
would solve without
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
bill problem so if we just keep reducing
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
and um over year after year um where are
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
we going to meet our obligations
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
and meals revenue has gone through the
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
roof and you know the liquor commission
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
is delivering plenty of money
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i you know i mean like i say for
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
myself i mean i
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know i i you know i pay
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
over fifteen thousand dollars a year in
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
in rooms tax you know
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
so they're they're you know the only
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
paychecks if you make money

the tax is direct it doesn't have any
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether i make money or not
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
