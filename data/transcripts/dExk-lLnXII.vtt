foreign

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
your mind's working
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we we currently do direct
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
certification with a lot of dhhs
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
programs like tanf snap
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
and so to talk about the privacy issue
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
it would be uh no different than
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
those existing programs we'd follow a
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
similar process and that process is
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
essentially dhs owns that data um
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know all the details about the
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
data but there is mostly automation
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
where it's trying to match
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
all of those students using
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
computers not using human eyes so and
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
that keeps basically dhs's owns the data
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
they're getting our student data not d
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
now we're getting dhs data but it's
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to dhhs they're doing the matching
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
through an automated fashion and it's
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's pretty effective sometimes it's not
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
100 effective in a sense that there's uh
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions that pop out and then that
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
requires some
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
eyes from doe to look at some of the
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
data look at the student data look at
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
the direct certification and see if
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's matching but for the most part
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that is an existing process so if
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
we were to enter this program
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
um it would follow those same processes
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
so the same
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
privacy controls we have
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
with our existing programs that interact
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
with dhs would also
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
be used for this program so it would be
 
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
be used for this program so it would be
um

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
as far as the privacy concern that would
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
be how that would play out
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
just about title one
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
it would change
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
so our title one allocation is and i
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't know all the details about title
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
one because that's not my program
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire gets kind of the uh
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're called the bare minimum state we
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
get the bare minimum from the feds so i
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it would change i don't
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
think entering this medicaid direct
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
store program would change the amount of
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
money we get through title 1.
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
it would change
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
we use fnr data to allocate it out so if
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
we get a lump sum of
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
40 million we allocate it out based on
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
fnr data so it would change potentially
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
how it's allocated out but the 40
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath thank you mark
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
so it would mean that the manner in
 
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:11.190 align:start position:0%
so it would mean that the manner in
which

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
the funds go to school districts would
 
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
the funds go to school districts would
become

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
more accurate
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
if we went into this system
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
because right now we know that
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
especially high school children and
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
middle school children are apt to not
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
apply for free and reduced lunches
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
but in fact if their families are are
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
eligible then it would be noted as such
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
correct so it would um it would be less
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
contingent upon people filling out the
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
application and more contingent upon
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
what eligibility what means tested
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
programs are they currently enrolled in
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
including medicaid which is a very
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
popular program
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
so it would increase the fnr numbers we
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't know by what amount but it would
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of
 
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.750 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of
uh

00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
students in poverty that we are able to
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
identify using that automated system so
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
it would ultimately find more students
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
in in theory you could have 100 of
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
students fill out the application but we
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
suspect that's we know that's not
 
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.550 align:start position:0%
suspect that's we know that's not
happening

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
so yes it would likely improve the
 
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.910 align:start position:0%
so yes it would likely improve the
accuracy

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks mark for being with us uh
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
this morning um when you say um
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid school is a very popular
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
program how how does that
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
um i mean i think what you mean is it's
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
a a a highly accurate it accurately
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
reflects a a population
 
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
reflects a a population
um

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.069 align:start position:0%
um
how

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
how much more accurate is medicaid to
 
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.829 align:start position:0%
how much more accurate is medicaid to
schools

00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
as a proxy for low income families than
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
let's say free and reduced price lunch
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
um so let me um i'll just be i think i
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
said meditated to schools and that's a
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
whole other thing i'm just talking i'm
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
sorry and i i think i misspoke um so
 
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
sorry and i i think i misspoke um so
students

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
um enrolled in medicaid is what kind of
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
just one of the term i was using yeah
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
and by popular i just mean um uh
 
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.110 align:start position:0%
and by popular i just mean um uh
uh

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's a larger number of students so we
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
we currently direct sir so we have
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
around 40 000 fnr students and we using
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
our direct search system um almost i
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number but a large
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
majority are those direct our direct
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
cert um and we use direct cert as a
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
validation so some people fill out an
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
application and at the same time they
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
direct cert so we kind of catch them on
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
on belts and suspenders catch them twice
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the data set
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
i just believe medicaid since we have
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
and here's the number we got from dhs we
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
have 70 000
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh children ages 5 to 17
 
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.910 align:start position:0%
uh children ages 5 to 17
um

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in our medicaid program that
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
and then i think we we got the data from
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
director lipman with uh dhhs and i think
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
he used 196 percent of the poverty
 
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.350 align:start position:0%
he used 196 percent of the poverty
guideline

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
um def in our program is 185 so just
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
using the data he had he could get us
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
within 196. so we got us pretty close so
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
what that tells me is there's
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of children ages 5 to 17 on
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid but they're not necessarily
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
filling out applications they're not
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily in tanf snap or some of the
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
other programs so that's all the only
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
insights we can glean from that from
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative vlad
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
medicaid to school is a whole different
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
program and we don't want to go there we
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
we've gone through that in the last
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
three four years here um i was i was
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
concerned though when you talk about
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
title one
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and how that's impacted by free and
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
reduced we also have other federal
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.829 align:start position:0%
reduced we also have other federal
programs

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
which also are contingent upon
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
federal dollars based upon poverty
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
and carl perkins is one of them
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
is the carl perkins
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for those dollars
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
are there programs or states which are
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
using the medicaid approach to
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
identifying poverty other other than fnr
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'd be curious to know so that we if we
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
go this direction we're not going to
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
lose revenue on another side the coin
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking now career technical
 
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.510 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking now career technical
education

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i can't speak to the uh details of
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
the that that federal grant for cte um
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure unsure how it would
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
potentially risk federal dollars there
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
well jeff bearden probably would have
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
if we could just make sure we get that
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
clarified for us before we step off the
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
i can pose that question to jeff thank
 
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
i can pose that question to jeff thank
you

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
are you sure
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
are you sure poverty feels well yes on
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
that side not in the program we have not
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
in our state appropriations but on the
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
federal dollar we get from carl perkins
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is based upon part of that formula is
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes represent murray thank you madam
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
chair um two questions
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for explaining about the
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
automation for the privacy issue i think
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know you did a nice job moving the
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
human element out of it but someone is
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to ask what happens if someone
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
gets into that program you know if a
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
human person has to go into it for some
 
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.630 align:start position:0%
human person has to go into it for some
reason

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
can you say what it is that actually see
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
because this is you know pertaining to
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the privacy and whether or not mary jo
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
is in the program or not
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
um and the second thing can someone just
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
for my own education
 
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:43.830 align:start position:0%
for my own education
why

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh so as far as the privacy what they
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
would see they would not see so the
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
department of education uses acid which
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
is a unique identifier for students uh
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
other programs i believe dhhs is using
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
something like a social security so um
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't think they would
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh i whenever whenever someone at doe
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
sees the social security numbers they
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
immediately like they should never be
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
seeing that so um i i don't think they
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
would be seeing that detail i think it
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
would stay within this acid because the
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
only information they need to identify
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
the student is
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
first name last name and date of birth
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
because those would be the and basically
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
what they would be looking at is those
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
those data sets or those three data
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
points and they were going okay is the
 
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.710 align:start position:0%
points and they were going okay is the
automation

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
automation
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
choosing the exception because um uh is
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
it matthew or matt something like that
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
so that's really what they're
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
identifying so first name last name date
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
of birth and they go okay if it's date
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
of birth and there's a matthew and a mat
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
and they have the same last name uh we
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
think we can certify this because it's
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
in their their town of residence maybe
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
as well um i don't know all the data
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
sets but something along those lines and
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
it would be the minimum amount of data
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
data necessary to to do the matching
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
with validity um as far as bare minimum
 
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.150 align:start position:0%
with validity um as far as bare minimum
state

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.149 align:start position:0%
state
um

00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
i i think it i don't know exactly but i
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
think what happens is and this is an
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
interesting thing uh to point to what
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative lad was talking about we
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
have two different allocations we have
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the allocation done
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
done among the 50 states and then these
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
we have the allocation dental to the
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
districts and so new hampshire
 
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.230 align:start position:0%
districts and so new hampshire
typically

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
with a program like title one
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
we use fnr data to allocate out to our
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
districts but the way the u.s government
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
allocates and this is just title one i'm
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
not talking about the cte federal grants
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
but the way title one works is the u.s
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
government uses u.s census data and so
 
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.430 align:start position:0%
government uses u.s census data and so
historically

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
historically
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
this new hampshire has not liked u.s
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
census data on the way when they get to
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
the granularity uh the policy position
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the state has been that has not been
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
a good data set to use u.s census data
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
instead using fnr data so
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
i think u.s census i think u.s
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
government looks at u.s census data and
 
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.710 align:start position:0%
government looks at u.s census data and
determines

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
determines
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does not have poverty
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
levels sufficient to provide excess
 
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:08.950 align:start position:0%
levels sufficient to provide excess
funding

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am cheer mark thank you um
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
isn't it true when i was at the
 
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
isn't it true when i was at the
department

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
anyone who saw or had access to any
 
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.149 align:start position:0%
anyone who saw or had access to any
names

00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
names
 
00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:23.110 align:start position:0%
names
for

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
sacid or because they had to do some
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
kind of matching
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
had to sign um a form
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
saying that they promised never to
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
disclose so it was like a disclaimer
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
that they they had to sign at the point
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
in time i'm presuming that the
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
department continues that practice
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh there's the education privacy
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
law you know we're all familiar with
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
hippo with our health information with
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
education it's ferpa
 
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.029 align:start position:0%
education it's ferpa
um

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
we all are
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
have to uh uphold ferpa i i don't know
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i don't see a lot of i
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
don't see that data i don't see um names
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
if a name ever comes across me i'm
 
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.029 align:start position:0%
if a name ever comes across me i'm
always

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
our policy is shut it down like do not
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know do not tell me a name if a
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
district's talking to me and they use
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
student names i ask them to stop doing
 
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.830 align:start position:0%
student names i ask them to stop doing
that

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do that because that's
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
how they know the students but that's
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
not how i should know the student i
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
should know them by sasab um so that's
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's our policy i don't know if the
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
data people are likely uh they're
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
educated i know they're educated on
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
ferpa i don't know what they're signing
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
but we certainly are aware of our
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to follow federal privacy
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh i do have one question and this deals
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
seemed to be something so
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
would it be feasible or possible
 
00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:57.190 align:start position:0%
would it be feasible or possible
to

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
student identification number
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
to the various school districts
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
and have them figure out if the parent
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
wants to opt in or opt out
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
i that um
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
i know that that question came up in the
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
senate education and i think i was
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
talking with with um
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
d.o.e was talking internally what that
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
would look like not exactly sure but i
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
think the way it would look like is we
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
would send the direct certification
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
information to
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
the district the district would become
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
aware that these students are eligible
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
for free meals
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
and so i think the parent would have to
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
then go to their district and say i
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
unders like basically take me off the
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
list um so i think that's how it would
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
mechanically work um so there would be
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
an opt-out
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh but it would be an opt-out at the
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
local level not at the state level
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
local level not at the state level
okay

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
i just um
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
i just think if we're going to move
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
forward with this legislation
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
that we need to have some sort of
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
opt-out provision at the local level not
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
at i agree not
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
so not at the state level karen sure um
 
00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
so not at the state level karen sure um
so

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
popped out we have opt out with free and
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
reduce right now the parent just doesn't
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
fill the forms out and doesn't submit
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
them in that's our problem our problem
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
is that the high school students there's
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
that tremendous waterfall effect of qual
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
those people eligible seeing that they
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't fill the forms out
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
so what are we going to gain by going
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
with medicaid if they're going to not
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
opt in to this particular program it
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have them opting out
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
either way
 
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.350 align:start position:0%
either way
no

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
they would automatically be in
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
of medicaid
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think you have to connect it to
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure based on what what mark's
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
talking about that you have to connect
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
it to free and reduced lunch
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
really from a from a doe a new hampshire
 
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
really from a from a doe a new hampshire
doe

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
doe
 
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
doe
funding

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
formula basis through the direct
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
certification oh i see what you're
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
saying okay so i think what a little bit
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
of miscommunication here but i will
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative umberg is talking about
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
is um because we have two different uses
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the data so
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
we would direct and this is interesting
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
i guess now this is brings up a good
 
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.110 align:start position:0%
i guess now this is brings up a good
question

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.549 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
for the family so we direct certif say
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
you have one student they're in high
 
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
you have one student they're in high
school

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
and they're eligible they're in the
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
medicaid program
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
receiving medicaid services et cetera
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
ella medicaid insurance
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
now they're attending the high school
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
the parent decides that they don't want
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
that high schooler to
 
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
that high schooler to
um

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
enter the fnr program so then we would
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
have the local opt-out where that family
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that student would go to the
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh their school and opt out of the fnr
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
program but now that's an interesting
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
do we still record them in the
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
f as fnr and the adequacy and i
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think mechanically we would we would
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would certainly agree with yeah
 
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.789 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would certainly agree with yeah
but

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
but
they're

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
at the local level what they're opting
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.470 align:start position:0%
out of
is

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think all of the schools now have like
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
credit cards
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
right that
 
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.909 align:start position:0%
right that
that

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's what you used to
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
pay right they're opting out of the
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
lunch program and that
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know i just
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
i just know that we need an opt-out yeah
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
but mark what why would
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
why would the department
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
have to what
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
let me ask a different way could the
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
department shift away from using uh free
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
and and use the the um
 
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.390 align:start position:0%
and and use the the um
the

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
basically the
 
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.029 align:start position:0%
basically the
the

00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:12.149 align:start position:0%
the
medicaid

00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
numbers that have matched with with
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
acids we would use the medic in my
 
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.389 align:start position:0%
acids we would use the medic in my
opinion

00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
we would use the medicaid number
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that a child at the local level
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
opts out
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
really would not have
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
an effect on
 
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.149 align:start position:0%
an effect on
the

00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
what we'll call the free and reduced
 
00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:36.149 align:start position:0%
what we'll call the free and reduced
lunch

00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:37.190 align:start position:0%
lunch
um

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
whatever right so
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
right it would be a medicaid adm per
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
school right but we don't want to call
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
it that we want to call it free and
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.909 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
okay

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's we don't i don't think i'll be
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
right with you tom i don't think
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
with this legislation
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know if it moves forward
 
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.269 align:start position:0%
you know if it moves forward
that

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
we need to change the names
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
looking at a behind-the-scene
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
different method
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
of determining
 
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.669 align:start position:0%
of determining
the

00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch numbers
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah act accuracy
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative bucco
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you manchester
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
um so as i
 
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.950 align:start position:0%
um so as i
understand

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.630 align:start position:0%
understand
the

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.149 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
automatically

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
including the numbers
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
for from medicaid
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
we we we need we wanted to do that so
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
that we would have more accurate
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
numbers for our state program for for
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
the act of previous adequacy grants
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we would still be using but
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
even if they wanted to opt out of the
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
lunch program that
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't affect that
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
is that right and that's what we want to
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
do that's that's correct
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
congratulations tom you got it but i'm
 
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.210 align:start position:0%
not there yet
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
not there yet
[Laughter]

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.389 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
medicaid

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
who has the medicaid information is it
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
dhhs or doe does doe have any of that
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
information right now
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh nhet has zero information on that oh
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
doe has zero information on it that's
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
what i thought now for us to get does or
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
allow or enable doe to capture this
 
00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:49.350 align:start position:0%
allow or enable doe to capture this
information

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
are they going to have to is dhh gonna
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
as gonna have to have
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
not the safety but department of health
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
and human services going to need
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to release that
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
information or do they just need
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
parental information authority
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
how is this going to transfer over so we
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
get it captured into our system so the
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
way the the steps would work is uh and
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
dh justin when uh so 1627 as amended by
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
the house included a provision that
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
mandated no changes in
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
really state law all it did was say
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
nh and dhs should work together to get
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
this accomplished and enter this program
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so from there if say if that bill
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
did pass the next steps in the process
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
would be uh um working with
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
usda and uscms the center for medicaid
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
services and making sure
 
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.789 align:start position:0%
services and making sure
um

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
getting the proper approval from the
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
federal government so cms would
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
basically authorize dhhs
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
to share that data with another state
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
agency because currently cms highly
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
regulates who has access to um
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know highly regulated but
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
regulates who has access to the medicaid
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
data and so uh dhs would not provide us
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
that data unless cms approved of it
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
through the entering of the pilot
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
program process i'm following that
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
conversation now who where's the parent
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
come involved in this in terms of the
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
parent authorizing do they authorize
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
dollars are coming from the feds down to
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
our departments to allow them to share
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
this data
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
where is the parent involved in this are
 
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
where is the parent involved in this are
they

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
left out of it so then how do they opt
 
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
left out of it so then how do they opt
out

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the answer of when when a
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
a parent signs up for medicaid for their
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
family um i don't know what uh
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
authorizations or approvals they sign
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
off on i can't answer that question but
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
that would be there that would be the
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
extent of their involvement as is
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the parents wouldn't be involved in the
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid eligibility process but i don't
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
think they would have
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the process i don't
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
know if they'd have any involvement
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
outside of that
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
well i i think that by sending
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
the student id number
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
back to the school
 
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.350 align:start position:0%
back to the school
and

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
parents have the option to opt out of
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
would

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
be the final parental
 
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:26.549 align:start position:0%
be the final parental
decision

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
maybe mary can help me with this one too
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh medicaid to the schools where we the
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
only way we can get involved with that
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
program is if we have like a nurse
 
00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:37.269 align:start position:0%
program is if we have like a nurse
id

00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
id
 
00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:38.549 align:start position:0%
id
and

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right so the the
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
permission for that uh to occur comes
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
from whom
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
the parent or from how do how do we know
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
that that person's a medicaid eligible
 
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.669 align:start position:0%
that that person's a medicaid eligible
student

00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
turn on
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone please and so
 
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone please and so
that

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is years ago when i was assistant
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent um the school
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
um had identified who was eligible
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
for that service
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
like anybody on katie beckett
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
automatically would be eligible for that
 
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:15.669 align:start position:0%
automatically would be eligible for that
um

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:17.029 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
then the school district follows through
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
that all services that that child gets
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
depending upon what they are there's a
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
sign off on each
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
of those so we've got the student now
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive that service
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
how do we get
 
00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
how do we get
the

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
authorization to release that
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
information to hhs so we can get the
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
support and medicaid
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get the connection here
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's all an electronic
 
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.950 align:start position:0%
i think it's all an electronic
connection

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
connection
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.269 align:start position:0%
that happens
um

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
is the parent involved with signing off
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
saying yes you can go
 
00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.350 align:start position:0%
saying yes you can go
to

00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
first of all when it's
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
when you're talking medicaid to school
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
nothing happens without the parents
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
signing off on the ibp and part of that
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
is all of those approvals
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
and during the conversation during an
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
iep for those individuals that are
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for that service the parent
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
would be part of that that's part of it
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and that's signed off i understand so
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is a sign off there would there be
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
a sign off in this other program we're
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
talking which is a distinct separate
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
program well this is all together
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
different though i mean this again would
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
be an electronical
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
coming together
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
um it would define accuracy
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
for the numbers of reduced lunch
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
students now if i were superintendent
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
and we have this opt out clause what i
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
would do is i would work with my food
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
service program and figure out those
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
students that are eligible based on the
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
data that i've received from the state
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
and the letter would go home to the
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
parents saying
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
it has been determined that your child
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
is eligible for free reduced lunch
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
period if you don't want to if you you
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
you aren't if you don't want this
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
service then you have the um you can
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
come in and opt out of it or some kind
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
of language like that so hhs will
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
release that information to the
 
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.230 align:start position:0%
release that information to the
superintendent

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
no no it would have to be at this local
 
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.630 align:start position:0%
no no it would have to be at this local
level

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
just a second the oe
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
would send the student identification
 
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.510 align:start position:0%
would send the student identification
number

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
or whoever
 
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.790 align:start position:0%
or whoever
okay

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
the superintendent would then take an
 
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
the superintendent would then take an
action

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.750 align:start position:0%
action
like

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative heath just described okay
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
whether they opt out of the lunch
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
program or not
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion would not affect the
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we provide to the
 
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.069 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we provide to the
schools

00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
schools
right

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
so the names public students names are
 
00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:13.270 align:start position:0%
so the names public students names are
never

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
available to anybody um the testing
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
company even has to do go through all
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of things to be able to work on
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
the test results so it's it's something
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's held i remember if you can
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
remember neil kirk and what we went
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
through um to get these programs in
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
place uh it was just really everything
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
had to be completely
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
private and names are held in complete
 
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
private and names are held in complete
security

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
thanks very much madam chair um so when
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
when when tom very articulately
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
said he he gets it i thought i got it
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
too and then when rick was going through
 
00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:56.310 align:start position:0%
too and then when rick was going through
some

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
sort of digging down i think i ungut it
 
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
sort of digging down i think i ungut it
um

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
and and so i i want to try to sort of
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
piece this back together uh
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question yeah why is it
 
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:09.730 align:start position:0%
the women get it and then
 
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.109 align:start position:0%
the women get it and then
[Laughter]

00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
because you've all been superintendent
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
oh no no no
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good comeback yeah yeah but um
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
so the the way this is sort of
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
sounding particularly after what what
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
rick was when and and mary were we're
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
talking about it sounds like in a
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
student record there's a sacid the
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
student id there's an indicator for
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're signed up for
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch and there's
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
another indicator as as yet no i
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
understand but at least as far as this
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
conversation goes and another indicator
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
of whether their their medicaid um um
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
either eligible or no
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
not at the local level
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay so well so the the conversation
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
that i thought rick um was was going
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
down was that in order to
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
check that medicaid box that involves
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
the parent and dhhs when a student is
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
looking to receive medicaid services in
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
the school because the school obviously
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
would have to know if the student was
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
was was
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid receiving medicaid services
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
right in order to build cnn put that
 
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.589 align:start position:0%
right in order to build cnn put that
thought

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.349 align:start position:0%
thought
away

00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay no no no i under i understand so so
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
the this is about how you go about
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
checking off that medicaid box in the
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
student record whether that's whether
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
that can be done automatically
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
through the pilot program
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
it would only
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
check off at the state level
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay the the school
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
would not get
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
anything other than
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
your these children are available for
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch okay how they got
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
to it how we got to it
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
is immaterial
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
and would not be boxes checked off
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
in any record
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay so the only thing that the that the
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um that the local
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
would have
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
is in a student rack i mean among other
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
things this acid and free ingredient
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
express lunch correct and and if they
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
were going down this completely other
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
unrelated thing to receive medicaid uh
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
services in school that's a totally
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
separate conversation between dhhs the
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
family and the district that's correct
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.470 align:start position:0%
 
mark

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
mark
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
is legislation required
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
for doe to go forward to usda to see if
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
qualify for this program
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
so technically no
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
but the department has asked that this
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
is a a policy decision that the
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to determine so we
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
will not
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh seek to enter the program unless
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation requires us to do so
 
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.829 align:start position:0%
legislation requires us to do so
so

00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
it won't be effective in the next budget
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
unless i convince
 
00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
unless i convince
doe

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
doe
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
to forget the need for legislation is
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's one way to look at it yes well
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's the only way to look at it
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
or or pass legislation or
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
but but also um and so what am i what am
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
i going to pass legislation
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
even if i pass it on january 5th okay by
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
the time you get
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
the stuff moving to usda
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
and by the time you get the information
 
00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.510 align:start position:0%
and by the time you get the information
back

00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
by the time you do all of this
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking january of 24.
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah so you know so
 
00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:11.589 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah so you know so
the

00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
let me clarify the timeline the timeline
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
so if if if
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature um passed
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
1627 as amended by the house that
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
included the requiring the department to
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
enter this program that that legislation
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
is dead yes if it under the hypothetical
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
they did so if you were to pass it um
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
say you passed it in june this month um
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
we would apply we would
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh the department would work to build
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the application this summer
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh we would uh submit that application
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
by september 2022
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then we would
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
um if we got approved it would impact
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
school year
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
23 24 that's when it would go in effect
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it would impact adequacy um so
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's we're already talking outside of
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the current budget the point is
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to get there
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
because the legislation didn't pass
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
with what you said
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
we would have to submit a bill
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
in november
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
which wouldn't come to the house until
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
january or february or march
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
the budget is already set up
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
by that time
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
for 24 25
 
00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:34.150 align:start position:0%
for 24 25
so

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
be able
 
00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
be able
to

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
include that
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
or sorry you could include uh the
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
dollars wouldn't impact the 2425 budget
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
but you could
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes if that's if that's what you're
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.829 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:03.109 align:start position:0%
yes
thanks

00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
but but if it were included in the um
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the budget if the pilot provision was
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
also included in the budget um could it
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it wouldn't be able to come
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
into effect in time to to to change fy
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
24 school budgets but it might be would
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
it be possible that it could have could
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
come in for fy25 school budget
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem there is
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.309 align:start position:0%
we don't know
what

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
that would
be

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's our problem
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
until we you know
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
on the budget side
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to budget for unknowns
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps you could do something
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
supplemental in
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know in late 24
 
00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
you know in late 24
for

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know for 25
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
but the money goes out
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
they figure out how much each school
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
gets like in
 
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.470 align:start position:0%
gets like in
march

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
so we do our estimates in november and
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
then okay yeah we do our final payment
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
in april yeah so he it's a it's a timing
 
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.670 align:start position:0%
in april yeah so he it's a it's a timing
issue

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.630 align:start position:0%
issue
for

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
for
25

00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
yeah we can do the authority that that's
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
not a that's not a problem
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
but it's the implementation
 
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.349 align:start position:0%
but it's the implementation
that

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
but we can't you know it won't be
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
may speak
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
the benefits of doing this
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
far outweigh
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
continuing the process we're currently
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
doing because of the inadequacies that
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
i totally agree
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
i just um
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
see if we can uh move forward without
 
00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:37.190 align:start position:0%
see if we can uh move forward without
legislation

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
i i think uh at this point in time uh we
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
we should try to move forward this
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
progress there's some real benefits to
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
it however
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
to do it without legislation
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
and to do it without statutory authority
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
that the department is requesting
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
um i i think that we're
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
we better be very very careful on that
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that we try to get
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
i you know you can have emergency
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
legislation as well you know i've done
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
that before when it came to the power
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
back then with what's his name from uh
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
coast county larry
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
rappaport wasn't it yep yeah mountain
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
chair yes um
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i i i i like what you were you're
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
talking about very much about about
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
about maybe uh another uh
 
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.990 align:start position:0%
about maybe uh another uh
uh

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the commissioner to um
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
to uh to really you know explain how
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
important to move how this you know
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this now
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
would would put us in a better footing
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
for uh for being able to use this as a
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
budgeting tool in the next bionium's
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
budget and i think
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd did something similar to
 
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.270 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd did something similar to
that

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
with what was it rick
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
there was a letter that the that you
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
sent from the from our committee to the
 
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.069 align:start position:0%
sent from the from our committee to the
commissioner

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
a particular issue
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
this would be a similar type of
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
i did that administratively because we
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
had a vote a majority vote a unanimous
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
vote of the committee to do that so i've
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
done that on numerous occasions and i
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
know that mary guy had done the same
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
thing previously
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah that is an opportunity to take
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that more administrative
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
send it directly from yourself karen
 
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.510 align:start position:0%
send it directly from yourself karen
to

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
here's what we want to do to the
 
00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:46.309 align:start position:0%
here's what we want to do to the
department

00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that and i think that's another way
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
of doing it but i would seek the the
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous support from fiscal not fiscal
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
but from the finance committee and you
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
get unanimous then i think that's good
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well we need unanimous support out
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
of here
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
so we're here at this group yeah
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay yeah because
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
division two doesn't make any decisions
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
by themselves
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
decisions have to go back to
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
um whatever the full committee
 
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.390 align:start position:0%
um whatever the full committee
okay

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.670 align:start position:0%
i know that
with

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
interim study i think we have
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.829 align:start position:0%
 
itl

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with legislation
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
or what's the third one
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's either recommended okay
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
either recommend or not recommend
 
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
either recommend or not recommend
so

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.549 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
could uh our assistant clerk
 
00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:57.349 align:start position:0%
could uh our assistant clerk
uh

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
can somebody make a motion to recommend
 
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
can somebody make a motion to recommend
for

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mary
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
i move that would recommend um
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
do i have a second
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.589 align:start position:0%
you're excited
well

00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you want us you know
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
i would probably not we're not
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
technically part of yes you are
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're part of this i'll be glad to make
 
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
you're part of this i'll be glad to make
okay

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
on anything here all right let's let's
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
do that then
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
and that way it shows both finance and
 
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
and that way it shows both finance and
education

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
just try to find out about carl perkins
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
for me will you please
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll uh we'll let mark
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah unless mickey
 
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.470 align:start position:0%
yeah unless mickey
mickey

00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
mickey
 
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.150 align:start position:0%
mickey
oh

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
sure do you have any idea on uh
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
probably not if mark doesn't but i
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
didn't hear the question representative
 
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.390 align:start position:0%
didn't hear the question representative
ladd

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
ladd
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
jeff beard has to answer that
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
we had a briefing about how we
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
arrive at the amount of money we have
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
for carl perkins to supplement our are
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
what we appropriate locally as a state
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
for cte and he indicated to us at that
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
meeting that that part of that formula
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
comes in the play of poverty
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
and and so that's based upon fnr
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
so i would assume then if we can do what
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here that that would
 
00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here that that would
also

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
how many other states are doing medicaid
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
are five or six of them are so oh it's
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and so they must
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
be doing it somehow
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.750 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
according to the email
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.710 align:start position:0%

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
oh oh
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't a quick call to
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
one of the commissioners in those states
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
just you know should they already asking
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
they've already talked to the people in
 
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.390 align:start position:0%
they've already talked to the people in
massachusetts

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
they had a long conversation with and it
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that it's not impacted our title one or
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
any other federal programs that the word
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
information is just as valid for these
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think what i think what mark said
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
believe this to be correct
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
is that because
 
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.950 align:start position:0%
is that because
our

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
poverty rate
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
is so low
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
we only get the minimum in title one
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
is that what you said
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
or am i misinterpreting it's using i
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
just know that the title one allocation
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't use uh fnr data it uses u.s
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
census data and i believe it's because
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
our u.s census data shows us not as a
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
poor state um
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah so um
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
not on me oh does representative
 
00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:54.870 align:start position:0%
not on me oh does representative
look

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay um but let's clear this up
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
befo before we
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
take our vote
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
ah

representative heath
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
madame chair could i also ask that as an
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
interim study committee that a letter be
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
pinned to the commissioner of education
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
asking that he reconsider his initial
 
00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
asking that he reconsider his initial
decision

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
to require legislation for this purpose
 
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.630 align:start position:0%
to require legislation for this purpose
okay

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
i will do that after we have
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
our full committee vote
 
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:07.829 align:start position:0%
our full committee vote
oh

00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.470 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
yes following on representative heath's
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
um suggestion would it uh would it would
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
it be
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that to come from both
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
the chair of finance as well as the
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
chair of education
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
any luck
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
yes um so whenever we think about
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
allocations we have to think about it
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
two different ways we think of the us
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
government allocation to all 50 states
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
and territories and then the state's
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
allocations to the districts and the way
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
the top-level allocations which is our
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
total amount of dollars we'll receive
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
for perkins for
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
the us government to allocate it out to
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
the states it's based on population so
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
not fnr just purely population um
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
didn't give me too much more details
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
than that but it does not involve
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
poverty but the way we allocate it out
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
from the state to the cte centers that
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
uses f r data so it wouldn't impact the
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
total dollars amount we received from
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
the us government
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
so no net change there in federal
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
dollars the state receives but it would
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
change just the same with title one just
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
the same with adequacy it would change
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
the distribution between the districts
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
pretending on how the direct certs
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
work out
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that explains how fnr is
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
involved in that program but on our
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh reps and heath there is um one aspect
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
of 623 that that i think um we don't
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
want to lose um
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
it refers to school years 22 and 23 but
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's the concept of that i would like to
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
see that we think about uh that each
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
municipality shall
 
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.069 align:start position:0%
municipality shall
um

00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
not be less than they'll receive not
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
less than the amount of such grant in
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
the prior year
 
00:58:20.839 --> 00:58:22.630 align:start position:0%
the prior year
um

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
that i don't want to be doing talking
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
about stabilization but i think in terms
 
00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:29.670 align:start position:0%
about stabilization but i think in terms
of

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
just being a former person who had to do
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
a scuba budget um
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
not knowing how much money you're going
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
to get from year to year is disastrous
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
so if you know you're getting an
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
allocation of 11 million dollars in
 
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.950 align:start position:0%
allocation of 11 million dollars in
adequacy

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
in 22
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
um but then all of a sudden in 23 your
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
numbers drop drastically and all of a
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
sudden you're going to get 7 million
 
00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
sudden you're going to get 7 million
dollars

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think there
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
might be something that we could look at
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
am i making any sense
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah um
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any clue
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
what happens from year to year
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
with the various school districts how
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
much difference
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy formula
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
no and what actually goes to the schools
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
i mean we've we've put in stabilization
 
00:59:46.799 --> 00:59:47.829 align:start position:0%
i mean we've we've put in stabilization
which

00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
still annoys me
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
yeah but the point is if you don't have
 
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.549 align:start position:0%
yeah but the point is if you don't have
stabilization

01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:05.750 align:start position:0%
stabilization
then

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
it drops significantly
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
so this year when we saw what happened
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
with cobit we saw drastic drops in
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
school enrollments that could
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
significantly impact what the october
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
one count
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
in one year was so different from the
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
october account in the next and not that
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
this this was an anomaly absolutely and
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it should be just something that's
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
done in the event that we have another
 
01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
done in the event that we have another
covent

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
covent
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
or another pandemic or something that
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
impacts enrollment but it just for a
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
school district to see such
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
changes a fluctuation in just a matter
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
of one year was totally unusual
 
01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
of one year was totally unusual
what

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.829 align:start position:0%
what
what

01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
year do we use now for figuring out
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
i think that we passed legislation
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
that went back to
 
01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:03.030 align:start position:0%
that went back to
2019

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.549 align:start position:0%
2019
pre-covered

01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
pre-covered
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
only for free and reduced price lunch
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
not not for
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
not for the a.d
 
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.670 align:start position:0%
not for the a.d
well

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
we did one speak on the statistics
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
we did um one
 
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
we did um one
mark

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
make eight just tell me if i'm wrong but
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
school districts received a separate pot
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
based on the 2019 numbers
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
this past september
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
but then we did another bill that just
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
made it for the free reduced lunch
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
numbers am i correct or am i wrong i
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
could be wrong well we didn't do any
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me we didn't do anything free and
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
reduced because everybody's getting free
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that it only ended
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
only ends the end of this month
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
so go ahead
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh you're getting very into the weeds
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
that relates to your role in the city of
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
manchester as far as the pot of money
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
and how that's used so without getting
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
too far into the weeds just to run
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
through the formula
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 we had about 167 000
 
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.109 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 we had about 167 000
students

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's looking at school year um ending
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
29 uh 2020 so pre-pandemic school year
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
so 167 000 students
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's fiscal year 21 fiscal year 22
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was an enrollment hold harmless
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
that looked at all metrics sped uh
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
regular base adm fnr etc and went back
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
to that 2020 school year that was not
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
impacted by the pandemic then in fiscal
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
year 23 and we're all i think we're all
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
on the same page here we all understand
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
this but fiscal year 23 we're just doing
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
the f and r hold harmless um uh that
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
essentially looks back at the ratio of
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
what you have for fnr for 2019 2020 but
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
then fiscal year 24 we're going to use
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
there will be no modifications to the
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
mine is pairing to the car outside in
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
mary i think that um i'm sorry
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative heath i think that's
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
something that we can um
 
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.549 align:start position:0%
something that we can um
discuss

01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:29.829 align:start position:0%
discuss
in

01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
division two
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
at budget time i don't i don't
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
i just don't i don't know what
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the differentiation is and we do
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
money

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
to the schools in
 
01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
to the schools in
september

01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
for budgeting purposes
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
so that they know is that correct it's
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
november 15th okay so november 15 excuse
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
me so they do know
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
what's going to be
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the allocation
 
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.589 align:start position:0%
the allocation
uh

01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
from this yeah for the following year
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
because schools budget on a yearly basis
 
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
because schools budget on a yearly basis
um

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.430 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
represent petrie
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh what was
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
the population uh in uh fall of 21 if
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
you have it you must have it
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
the the school number drop went from
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
just ballpark here we went from about
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
a 167 000 for that 2019-2020
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
and then we dropped down to about 160
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
000. so 7k drop
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
okay 20
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the fall of 2020 which is the 21
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
school year okay
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
sure yes um
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
so i i was taking a look at these
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
numbers this morning from the doe
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
website and put them on a spreadsheet as
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
mel miller knows i love spreadsheets um
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
and um and it is it is quite startling
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
because going i think i ran it back to
 
01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:24.069 align:start position:0%
because going i think i ran it back to
2012

01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
2012
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
when in our public schools we had 100
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 185 000 students
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then that sort of tripped down by
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
about 2 000 students a year
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
through about 2017 then about 1 000
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
students a year or 1500 students a year
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
through 2019 2020
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
dropped as as mark just said by about
 
01:05:48.559 --> 01:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
dropped as as mark just said by about
by

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
8 500 students from 2020 to 2021. so if
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
we took that sort of i don't know if we
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
want to call it organic decline of about
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
1500 students
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
a year there's about 7 000 students that
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
that did not enroll
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the school year
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
beginning while we were in the pandemic
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
beginning the fall of of 2020
 
01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:17.190 align:start position:0%
beginning the fall of of 2020
and

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i think this is something you know
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at that drop
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
167.6 thousand hundred sixty seven
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred fifty eight to a
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty nine thousand eighty eight
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
students so there's the seventy there's
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
the 8 500 students there and then you
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
take a look at the number of kids in
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
4 200 to 4 500
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
non-public schools um
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
50 little almost 16 000
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
little below to a little above
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the home school number sitting
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
around six thousand i don't know the the
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
identified by the department as being in
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
any other educational settings
 
01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
any other educational settings
and

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
well we hope they they are but but we
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
don't know where they are and and i
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
think that that it would be of interest
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
for the state to really understand that
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
going into
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
operating during a pandemic and coming
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
out of a pandemic there's going to be a
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of bumps on the on the road
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's what what
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
represent heath was was referring to but
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
i still think we have a um
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
um we we
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
it would be good to get an understanding
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
where these 7 000 students um
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
um where they're receiving their their
 
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.789 align:start position:0%
um where they're receiving their their
um

01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know educational services and that's
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
that's incl that's 7 000. that's net of
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
what we were seeing
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
historically is that or you know sort of
 
01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.829 align:start position:0%
historically is that or you know sort of
organic

01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
organic
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
drop in enrollment so i you know i think
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
there is still a concern there and i
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
think that could be wrapped up into
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
a um you know
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
maybe another bill that um that that
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
looks at um the adm effects following
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to decide
 
01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.670 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to decide
to

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
send this to our group okay that would
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
be fine i know that um
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know we have
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
several things over the years you know
 
01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:30.309 align:start position:0%
several things over the years you know
um

01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
some of which i agreed with some of
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
which i didn't and that's okay they got
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know they got passed
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
you know there's certainly no harm
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
in looking at
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on with adm
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
but the problem i think we all know
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
is the number of children
 
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
is the number of children
that

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
are entering any kind of education
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
dropping precipitously
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
and uh i think that's um
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know probably true
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
all across the u.s not not just in new
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire but i think we are seeing
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
a larger drop i have not seen the
 
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.470 align:start position:0%
a larger drop i have not seen the
demographic

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
demographic
study

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
study
of

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's population but
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
when our i think our average population
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
age is like 42 or
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
something or other like that
 
01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
something or other like that
they

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the people of childbearing
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
age the women of childbearing age
 
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
age the women of childbearing age
are

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
part of that's
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
any number of things is certainly not
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
jobs but
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
it is you know housing costs
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
availability of
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
any any number of any number of things
 
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.189 align:start position:0%
any any number of any number of things
so

01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
i will say that i was
 
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:14.830 align:start position:0%
i will say that i was
at

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
the town office yesterday and this lady
 
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.390 align:start position:0%
the town office yesterday and this lady
said

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
i called
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
on a rental
 
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
on a rental
at

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
first thing in the morning and she was
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
the first person that called
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
and she said i want the place.
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
the guy says well don't you want to come
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and look at it the owner
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
she said no i don't want to come and
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
i know the house i've seen it from the
 
01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.229 align:start position:0%
i know the house i've seen it from the
outside

01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm okay
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
he says well i better
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
wait and see if i get any other
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
phone calls
 
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
phone calls
so

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
when he called back at
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the evening
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
he said that he had gone over
 
01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:04.950 align:start position:0%
he said that he had gone over
500

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
500
 
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.550 align:start position:0%
500
requests

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
for that
house

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
and that's just in
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
conway with a population of 9
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
600 or whatever it is
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
but i think unfortunately
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that's going on
 
01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:26.950 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that's going on
and

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
some of it is a uh
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
a result of um
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
in our area of people moving up there
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
to get away from the cities and
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know enjoy the good life like i have
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
and tom has for years
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know the housing shortage that we
 
01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
you know the housing shortage that we
have

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
the good news is that
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
in conway
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
we've got
about

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.950 align:start position:0%
close to
probably

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
four to
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
at least 250
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of years and probably
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
another 250 in
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
within three years
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
in new housing so
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing but um
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
they'll be
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
they'll all be taken
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
right away so
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
anyhow okay i appreciate it and
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
since we can't meet in july and august
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
i will schedule something for early
 
01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
i will schedule something for early
september

01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
full finance committee
 
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
full finance committee
okay

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
and uh we have two bills this afternoon
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%

03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
because i think everything has been
 
03:04:00.319 --> 03:04:01.349 align:start position:0%
because i think everything has been
settled

03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
settled
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting remember when des
 
03:04:06.630 --> 03:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
was here it seemed that it was settled
 
03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:11.269 align:start position:0%
was here it seemed that it was settled
second

03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
is that right mickey
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we heard from the department last
 
03:04:17.349 --> 03:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
week that uh
 
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
there is an agreement a tentative
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
agreement with the state and econ on
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
this matter
 
03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i think the attorneys are just
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
drawing up papers to
 
03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
drawing up papers to
to

03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.760 --> 03:05:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:05:14.950 --> 03:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
this is to
 
03:05:20.230 --> 03:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
not recommend hb 1300 fna
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i vote
 
03:05:25.910 --> 03:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
not recommend which is one
 
03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:27.269 align:start position:0%
not recommend which is one
and

03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%

no well well are you are you there's no
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
there's no more
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is no no no further action
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
necessary okay yes
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:05:44.960 --> 03:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
so that's
okay

03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:05:49.990 --> 03:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
and representative murray
 
03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right so we got a vote of four to
 
03:05:54.800 --> 03:05:56.469 align:start position:0%
all right so we got a vote of four to
zip

03:05:56.469 --> 03:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
zip
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
for no further action okay so take care
 
03:32:10.389 --> 03:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
so i guess okay so this is the division
 
03:32:14.239 --> 03:32:15.030 align:start position:0%
so i guess okay so this is the division
two

03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:16.630 align:start position:0%

thank you and good afternoon my name is
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%

03:32:43.279 --> 03:32:44.229 align:start position:0%
and i represent sullivan county district
seven

03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:32:46.150 --> 03:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
which are the towns of akworth goshen
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
langdon lobster and washington
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to see that you're getting
 
03:32:57.190 --> 03:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
together for this interim study on this
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill that i proposed 1665
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
which sought to establish a municipal
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
that would be used for infrastructure
 
03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
repairs in order to facilitate the safe
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
passage and access on municipal roads
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
and bridges
 
03:33:18.630 --> 03:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
and so the the impetus uh the reason why
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
i brought this bill to the house was
 
03:33:20.560 --> 03:33:22.389 align:start position:0%
i brought this bill to the house was
because

03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
03:33:25.200 --> 03:33:27.429 align:start position:0%
there was no
statutory

03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:33:27.439 --> 03:33:28.469 align:start position:0%
statutory
uh

03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle or mechanism
 
03:33:31.359 --> 03:33:32.469 align:start position:0%
vehicle or mechanism
which

03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
came to the aid of
 
03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:36.229 align:start position:0%
came to the aid of
towns

03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:33:39.590 --> 03:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that suffered uh catastrophic damage to
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure
 
03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:42.790 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure
and

03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
when the july 29 floods hit acworth last
 
03:33:45.760 --> 03:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
when the july 29 floods hit acworth last
year

03:33:47.190 --> 03:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
we were struggling to
 
03:33:52.469 --> 03:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
find immediate funds
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
to help
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
put us back together
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh quickly
 
03:33:57.760 --> 03:33:58.830 align:start position:0%
uh quickly
and

03:33:58.830 --> 03:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:02.469 --> 03:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
so my idea was that we should have some
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh disaster relief fund
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
that towns can draw upon in the event of
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
a disaster
 
03:34:17.269 --> 03:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what this particular bill uh
 
03:34:18.309 --> 03:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
sought to
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
to remedy
 
03:34:23.910 --> 03:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
i know that we've passed legislation
 
03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:24.950 align:start position:0%
i know that we've passed legislation
that

03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:29.190 --> 03:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
allows for loans to be had from for
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities from the state
 
03:34:33.670 --> 03:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
there are stipulations that come with
 
03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:37.190 align:start position:0%
there are stipulations that come with
that

03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:38.790 --> 03:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
but i was
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that you know it still
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to have some sort
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
of kind of
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
almost a pool risk insurance policy that
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
could be set up by the state
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to draw upon which
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
they would contribute to uh annually
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
i mean in in this bill i base it on a
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
their operating
 
03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
their operating
uh

03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:05.680 --> 03:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh
budget

03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.160 --> 03:35:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
i've spoken to select board members
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
since then and they seem to think that
 
03:35:16.630 --> 03:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know a flat fee of
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
500 or a thousand dollars a year might
 
03:35:20.469 --> 03:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
be more
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
amenable maybe more towns would join in
 
03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
on this kind of a fund if it were
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
not based on a
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a side sliding scale
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
but in any way you know
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
i also know that we've had along the way
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
money coming to the municipalities from
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state for road and bridge repair
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i see that also
 
03:35:45.920 --> 03:35:46.710 align:start position:0%
and i see that also
as

03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
a problem in the way in which the
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
allocations for that money happens
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
because it's purely based on population
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if you look at some of the smaller
 
03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
and if you look at some of the smaller
towns

03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
usually the rural towns are pretty big
 
03:36:00.479 --> 03:36:02.229 align:start position:0%
usually the rural towns are pretty big
in

03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
area size so for instance
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
akworth only has 850 people but we have
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
55 miles worth of roads that we we
 
03:36:11.520 --> 03:36:12.870 align:start position:0%
55 miles worth of roads that we we
maintain

03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
75 percent of our operating budget is
 
03:36:19.439 --> 03:36:20.710 align:start position:0%
75 percent of our operating budget is
roads

03:36:20.710 --> 03:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
roads
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
money to go to the roads
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
and we can't simply keep up
 
03:36:25.520 --> 03:36:27.269 align:start position:0%
and we can't simply keep up
on

03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
maintaining them properly and thoroughly
 
03:36:32.950 --> 03:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
so that in the event of a catastrophic
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
event there tends to be more damage done
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
to them because they're not in tip-top
 
03:36:38.399 --> 03:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
to them because they're not in tip-top
shape

03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
shape
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of you know the
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
background if i can refresh memories of
 
03:36:47.590 --> 03:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
of why i brought this bill to the house
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
and the senate and
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what your intention is
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of proceeding with it uh given
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
monies that have been given to towns
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
and also um you know some of the
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh slight changes that we made to
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
current legislation that would
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh give loans to towns in the event of
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh an emergency situation
 
03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
all right will you take questions sure
 
03:37:19.030 --> 03:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um we
 
03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
have senate bills 602 and 609 i believe
 
03:37:26.790 --> 03:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we're both passed in and it was 402
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
and 409.
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
402 and four or nine four nine yep
 
03:37:32.160 --> 03:37:33.269 align:start position:0%
402 and four or nine four nine yep
um

03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
and also we have the emergency
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
301 chapter 301 was it 4-1
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you showed up the
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
civil emergency statute yes
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
rsa 913
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
and then we have additional funding
 
03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:49.910 align:start position:0%
and then we have additional funding
going

03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
we need to give these bills a shot and
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
see if this does the trick i think we've
 
03:38:06.309 --> 03:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
heard great stuff from you
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
from emergency
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
homeland security
 
03:38:09.439 --> 03:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
homeland security
and

03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
i just think we've we've taken the
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
necessary steps and we we need to see
 
03:38:17.190 --> 03:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
how that works first before we enter
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
into setting up another fund plus the
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
fact we have more money in our rainy day
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
fund than we've had in a long time so i
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
feel like we're better poised
 
03:38:27.030 --> 03:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know for me my
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation is not to go forward with
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation that's how i feel
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can you hear me
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
um the bills that marriage that
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative heath just mentioned
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
senator bill 409
 
03:39:01.040 --> 03:39:02.469 align:start position:0%
senator bill 409
um

03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:02.479 --> 03:39:03.590 align:start position:0%
um
did

03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
was what is the status of that did we
 
03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
pass that
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes so that that was that was supposed
 
03:39:09.199 --> 03:39:09.990 align:start position:0%
yes so that that was that was supposed
to

03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:11.349 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
kind of coordinate with 1665 so that
 
03:39:16.080 --> 03:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
kind of coordinate with 1665 so that
but

03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
i guess one of them was
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
there was one was a loan and one was a
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
grant or something like that this this
 
03:39:25.189 --> 03:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
came this money would have come out of a
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a insurance risk pool kind of
 
03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:28.870 align:start position:0%
sort of a insurance risk pool kind of
thing

03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
right but
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
the other legislation that we passed is
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.720 --> 03:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
made changes to the loan program that's
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
already in existence that's been in
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
existence since 2017.
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 402 created a new mechanism
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
and mechanism that a municipality could
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
apply for up to 50 percent of the
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
reimbur 50 percent of the state or the
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
seemingly the local match of the
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
female reimbursable costs correct
 
03:40:08.399 --> 03:40:10.630 align:start position:0%
female reimbursable costs correct
yeah

03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
just to follow up mr chairman so that so
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
that means with that but those bills
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
that would that did get passed
 
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities won't be stuck out there
 
03:40:21.670 --> 03:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
waiting forever anymore like what
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
there would be something in statute that
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
would allow for a municipality to seek
 
03:40:31.189 --> 03:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
grant funds that currently does not
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
exist that's what senate bill 402
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
would do
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
that that was not really grant though
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's loan money 409 is the loan program
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
that would be paid back 402 would be up
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
to 50 percent of the cut the state would
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
share the local costs but that's after
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
the fema reimbursement happens yes
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
correct so they'd have to wait for that
 
03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:53.429 align:start position:0%
correct so they'd have to wait for that
money

03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
yeah the department could speak to the
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
timelines a little bit but yes this
 
03:40:58.830 --> 03:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
would be on reimbursable costs
 
03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:00.469 align:start position:0%
would be on reimbursable costs
yeah

03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
my point is just that there's something
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
there that
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't there an option and one of those
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh for the loan that the state could
 
03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:17.189 align:start position:0%
uh for the loan that the state could
um

03:41:17.189 --> 03:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
forgive the loan basically i think that
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
was also an option for some of the
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
smaller communities possibly
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
i think that was another another
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
it was in
 
03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:32.389 align:start position:0%
it was in
another

03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
there was a language in there somewhere
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think you could be thinking that it
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
was no interest but i don't think it was
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
under the loan program any mechanism
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be anything forgiven
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
right it was an august incident i
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
believe would wasn't that the august
 
03:41:52.469 --> 03:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.389 --> 03:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
correct and they and they they're
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about forgiving more of the
 
03:41:55.920 --> 03:41:56.950 align:start position:0%
thinking about forgiving more of the
loan

03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
loan
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
or taking on the state's going to take
 
03:42:00.309 --> 03:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
on more of the
 
03:42:00.319 --> 03:42:06.469 align:start position:0%
on more of the
payments

03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.469 --> 03:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not remembering
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
yeah no not not totally no no no there's
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
no there's really no
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
grant money immediate grant money that's
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
available to a town who needs it
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
but one thing i do want to keep in mind
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether this bill goes forward or not
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the future when when there are road
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
and bridge funds available to these
 
03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:39.189 align:start position:0%
and bridge funds available to these
towns

03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we take a look at doing an
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
allocation not based on population alone
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps on
 
03:42:49.590 --> 03:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
miles of road that the town maintains
 
03:42:52.150 --> 03:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
well we we did have one bill that uh on
 
03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:53.349 align:start position:0%
well we we did have one bill that uh on
bridges

03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
that covered the
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
and and actually we decided that in
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
finance here
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
that i believe half was based on the
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
amount of square footage you have of
 
03:43:04.150 --> 03:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
bridges bridge deck yes and and also
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
population so it was half and half so
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
that would help a town like yours a
 
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
little bit i mean i when i looked at the
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
the allocation chart acworth got what
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
seventy six thousand dollars which isn't
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
gonna help which isn't going to help
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
very much i mean let's face it even
 
03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
though we
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
these bills that we've been putting out
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
for road and bridge um help
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
tax on you know tax relief
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
they've been great
 
03:43:31.359 --> 03:43:32.229 align:start position:0%
they've been great
but

03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
for a small town who has 850 people they
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
always get crumbs they get nothing of
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
the millions of dollars that we send out
 
03:43:39.279 --> 03:43:40.389 align:start position:0%
the millions of dollars that we send out
there

03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know while we're grateful for
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
whatever we can get from the state to
 
03:43:45.199 --> 03:43:46.469 align:start position:0%
whatever we can get from the state to
help

03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
when you look at what roads and bridge
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
takes to repair
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
it costs the same whether you're a big
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
town or a small town whether you have
 
03:43:55.830 --> 03:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
850 people or
 
03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
850 000 people
 
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
so i think that going forward one of the
 
03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
things that we have to be very sensitive
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
in in road and bridge funds coming from
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
is not just basing it on population we
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
have to do more to get
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
more funds to these smaller towns that
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to maintain
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
larger areas of roadways and bridges
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
so i hope that the finance committee can
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
take that back and and look at that next
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
time we're dealing perhaps in budget
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
cycle if we're looking to give more
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
money out to
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities for roads and bridges to
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
figure out a different way to allocate
 
03:44:36.150 --> 03:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
the money out to towns and municipal
 
03:44:36.160 --> 03:44:38.070 align:start position:0%
the money out to towns and municipal
municipalities

03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
municipalities
but

03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
version of murray can you um i guess
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit longer about you
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
said that you have 55 miles of
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
road in this community
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
are those all municipal roads or on some
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
of those state roads where you would get
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
i mean that's 55 miles of town municipal
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
roads that we maintain
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
i mean we do have how much we do have
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
route 123a that goes through our town
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that's state
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
um maintained
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
so but um
 
03:45:12.870 --> 03:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
and and there was some from july 29
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
flooding there was some damage done on
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
those roads as well which
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
the state has come out and kind of
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
patched up which they're kind of
 
03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
in need of work now too
 
03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're still in our town we're
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
still really working hard to get through
 
03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
repairs i know my road forest road
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh was just temporarily repaired and
 
03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's already you know the sides are
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
falling out and everything and it's
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
gonna have to be a total redo
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know when the planning board and
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh town selectmen have decided when
 
03:45:50.309 --> 03:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
those roads are gonna be actually fixed
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
but um it's
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's hard for us because
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
like i said we're
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
a town of 850 people that tax base is
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
very very small compared to others and
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the amount of other road
 
03:46:05.910 --> 03:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
repairs that we have to keep up with
 
03:46:05.920 --> 03:46:06.790 align:start position:0%
repairs that we have to keep up with
so

03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and you you know you take a
 
03:46:10.150 --> 03:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
how many years a decade of of what we've
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
put into our road infrastructure and
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
overnight everything was destroyed so
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know you now you got to put pay
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
catch up play catch up with it and
 
03:46:26.550 --> 03:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
certainly working with fema
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
has taken a long long time we're still
 
03:46:32.229 --> 03:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
waiting for funds to come back to us
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
i even had
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
selectmen from leemster call me
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
because they did after the july 29th
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
flood they did all their road repairs
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
and they are waiting now from
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from fema for the for the
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
road repairs that they did in the
 
03:46:48.870 --> 03:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
meantime they have no money left in
 
03:46:51.189 --> 03:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
their fund balance or in their budget to
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
pay their bills and they're trying to
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
how we're going to do this they've had
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
to take out um
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
one of the tax anticipation notes
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
and um you know it's it's hard when
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
you've got a small community
 
03:47:08.229 --> 03:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
with not a huge tax base to to keep up
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
fund or
 
03:47:15.680 --> 03:47:17.110 align:start position:0%
fund or
mechanism

03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps would help a town
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
in need
 
03:47:21.680 --> 03:47:22.550 align:start position:0%
in need
uh

03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
okay sure thank you
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
03:47:30.720 --> 03:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
consideration

03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm jen harper i'm the
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
director from homeland security and
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
emergency management and with me is
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
vanessa yurango my i'm sorry what was a
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
vanessa vanessa urango you are a-n-g-o
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
and she is in charge of all of our uh
 
03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
disasters for the state of new hampshire
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:48:11.349 --> 03:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
so just one comment uh and vanessa can
 
03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
probably elaborate much more than i can
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
putting money like in a risk pool or
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
i think we had chatted about this
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
earlier in the
 
03:48:23.120 --> 03:48:24.229 align:start position:0%
earlier in the
year

03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
and that if
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
that happens it's like having insurance
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
and some of the projects would not be
 
03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for fema reimbursement if
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's a pool of money that towns can
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
go to so just kind of a
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
remembering that off the top of our
 
03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:40.150 align:start position:0%
remembering that off the top of our
heads

03:48:40.150 --> 03:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
heads
 
03:48:40.160 --> 03:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
heads
um

03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
you had a question i did um
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
um in the the actions we've taken some
 
03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:48.070 align:start position:0%
um in the the actions we've taken some
actions

03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
actions
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
and the governor has authority to
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
mobilize the state agencies so i think
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
there are things we've we've really made
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think we've taken action
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh to kind of mitigate what what
 
03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:02.229 align:start position:0%
uh to kind of mitigate what what
happened

03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:49:02.239 --> 03:49:03.429 align:start position:0%
happened
and

03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the steps we've
 
03:49:05.520 --> 03:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the steps we've
taken

03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
taken
 
03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:07.910 align:start position:0%
taken
really

03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:49:07.920 --> 03:49:09.429 align:start position:0%
really
um

03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
would kind of not eliminate what
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
happened in in in your hometown
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
but would um
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
kind of mediate a solution in a in a
 
03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:20.710 align:start position:0%
kind of mediate a solution in a in a
faster

03:49:20.710 --> 03:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
faster
 
03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:21.910 align:start position:0%
faster
manner

03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
manner
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
so that we really don't need 1665
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
because we have other pieces of
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislation in place right i think with
 
03:49:29.279 --> 03:49:30.550 align:start position:0%
legislation in place right i think with
what

03:49:30.550 --> 03:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
we've all talked about this session
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
and making the change for communities to
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
get a look non-interest loan up front
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:42.870 align:start position:0%
you know
immediately

03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
to help them with some of their exp
 
03:49:48.150 --> 03:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
immediate expenses for emergency work to
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
be done and to get that money back
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
quickly would
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
be great
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
i know that vanessa and her team
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
speaking just for acworth
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
meet with the town on a weekly basis to
 
03:50:03.279 --> 03:50:04.070 align:start position:0%
meet with the town on a weekly basis to
go

03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
where the projects at where are they
 
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
with development of the project does
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
that happen immediately when
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
when something happens would will now
 
03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
will that happen immediately so do you
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
want to just quick
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
talk about that process i'm sorry to
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but i see her shaking her
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
head yeah
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
context is good yes um
 
03:50:25.199 --> 03:50:26.389 align:start position:0%
context is good yes um
so

03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
when this process starts immediately
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
after disaster it is a pretty
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time that has to
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
that occurs between the disaster
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
incident and when fema's program
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually gets off the ground
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
um in many cases it's multiple months
 
03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
before a disaster declaration takes
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
place then fema has to mobilize to the
 
03:50:44.479 --> 03:50:45.349 align:start position:0%
place then fema has to mobilize to the
state

03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
where the issue has occurred and the
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
program gets spun up from there so it's
 
03:50:52.870 --> 03:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
but the governor maintains the authority
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
to initiate
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
disaster aid to the local community
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
does he not
 
03:51:06.150 --> 03:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
in what has that ability
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
in what sense
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting state agencies
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
to assist a community right so if
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
something so like what happened out in
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
cheshire and sullivan county back in
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
july of last year
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
i am so the state emergency operations
 
03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
center opened up we were getting reports
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
from local communities what's going on
 
03:51:28.229 --> 03:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
out there d.o.t was out there state
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
police was out there you know we're
 
03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
trying to see what other resources a
 
03:51:36.070 --> 03:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
community may need for that emergency
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
right then right there that night when
 
03:51:40.150 --> 03:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
the water's coming down the roads and
 
03:51:43.110 --> 03:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
then the next days afterwards
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
but like vanessa said the money and the
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
work that we need to do
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
03:51:51.040 --> 03:51:52.630 align:start position:0%
after the fact
is

03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
quite lengthy
 
03:51:57.110 --> 03:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
so there's been no and representative
 
03:51:58.630 --> 03:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
aaron can
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
confirm this but there's been no
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
projects that have been obligated in the
 
03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
town of akworth have we obligated other
 
03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:06.229 align:start position:0%
town of akworth have we obligated other
projects

03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
projects
 
03:52:06.239 --> 03:52:07.510 align:start position:0%
projects
um

03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
for the disaster very few so it is
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
a the fema process for recovery is a
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
very long process
 
03:52:20.790 --> 03:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
so the what the towns can do is go and
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
ask for that loan hey we need you know
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
however many
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes they could ask for it but it was
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
with interest
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative murray
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
i think she just answered the question
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm saying with
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
the this set of mechanisms that's in
 
03:52:37.359 --> 03:52:38.389 align:start position:0%
the this set of mechanisms that's in
place

03:52:38.389 --> 03:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:52:40.389 --> 03:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
the state can release that can release
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
money earlier than it used to before
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
which to help get the um the
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
construction of the repairs underway
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
before fema comes in so the money can
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
move more quickly to the community so
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
so in terms of your question about
 
03:53:07.520 --> 03:53:10.870 align:start position:0%
so in terms of your question about
mobilization

03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
when the disaster happened
 
03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
acworth did ask the state for some help
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
we need signs we need
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
whatever flags or sand or gravel or
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
whatever to help fix some of the issues
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
and prevent people from going to places
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
that are going to be dangerous and i
 
03:53:40.389 --> 03:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
know this department of transportation
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
was mobilized to help the western part
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
resources to that side of the state
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
however that being said a lot of that
 
03:53:53.670 --> 03:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
mobilization only happened for state
 
03:53:53.680 --> 03:53:55.429 align:start position:0%
mobilization only happened for state
roads

03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
roads
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
when we and we did ask for barricades
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing and
 
03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
were able to get
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
some things from uh the operations
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
director of department of transportation
 
03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
but not a lot of stuff and we were
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
actually directed to go to um there's a
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
a mutual aid for municipalities an
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
organization for mutual aid that towns
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
do have to pay a fee to belong to
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we got in contact with them as well
 
03:54:29.030 --> 03:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately you know they had
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
resources going to other places too
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
and were not able to get us trucks or
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
sand or gravel or whatever we needed
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
so we were really hard-pressed to try
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
and find resources
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
in the midst of this disaster to try and
 
03:54:46.950 --> 03:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
fix roads to make them passable and safe
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that emergency vehicles can get
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
through for example
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that's also an issue i would
 
03:54:53.910 --> 03:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
really like to see
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
the state have
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
um sort of like a swat team or you know
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
an emergency response team to go out and
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
help municipalities
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
for non-state roads because what they
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
deal with is state stuff
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
they don't they their their
 
03:55:13.150 --> 03:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
purview is not
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities or municipal roads
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
if they had some sort of an emergency
 
03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:20.469 align:start position:0%
if they had some sort of an emergency
dispatch

03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
dispatch
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
crew that can come out and help
 
03:55:25.030 --> 03:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
the municipal road crews that would
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
really be
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
something that would be helpful and
 
03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:28.790 align:start position:0%
something that would be helpful and
that's

03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
anything i wanted what i wanted to add
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
