welcome to the committee on science
 
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
technology and energy or otherwise known
 
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
as 90% energy bills um we uh made a I
 
00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
made an attempt to U emphasize energy in
 
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
our committee by changing our by
 
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
submitting a change to our name to put
 
00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
energy first uh which was a good
 
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
argument as far as what the the way we
 
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
work and the bills we work on but
 
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the rules committee did
 
00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
not agree with me so you're stuck with
 
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
Science Tech and energy being last
 
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
although it's first in our agenda here
 
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%

it's several people discussing several
 
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
topics perhaps at the end of each topic
 
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
or something we might break for a A or
 
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
not break but pause for questions or
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%

assistant commissioner at the Department
 
00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services um I thought
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
we would start with a brief overview of
 
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 align:start position:0%
the department I'll probably speak for
 
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
10 or so minutes to give you a holistic
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
view of what the department does and and
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
some of the functions there and then
 
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
um the at chairman vos's request uh we
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
dams in New Hampshire we're going to
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
talk about the air Resources Division uh
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
broadly and get more in depth on that
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
because most that's mostly what will be
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
coming to your committee or bills that
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
they deal with and then we're going to
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
talk about uh the regional greenhouse
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
gas initiative uh that's a regional
 
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
initiative that that we New Hampshire
 
00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 align:start position:0%
participates in and then lastly we'll
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
talk about past and Air um in those
 
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
issues so uh we have a lot to get
 
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
through so I'll I'll I'll get started I
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
always like to start off with our
 
00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
mission statement which is to help
 
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
sustain a high quality of life for all
 
00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
citizens by protecting and restoring the
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
environment and Public Health in New
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we recognize that doing so is
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
is is extremely important and we take it
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
very seriously but we also have to
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
recognize that uh it goes hand inand
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
with a strong economy right and making
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
sure that we we balance all of those
 
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
things uh so as to not uh reduce uh the
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
quality of life but to to to enhance it
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
while we're enhancing our our economy um
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
over over time as you can imagine since
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
the department was start uh was
 
00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 align:start position:0%
established uh we we've kind of taken
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
care of a lot of the low hanging fruit
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
right the um really really negative air
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
emissions you know the cleaning up our
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
waterways and uh remediating uh really
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste uh waste sites um and as
 
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
time has gone on uh you know things like
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants past have become
 
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
more uh PR you know more prominent more
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the uh in view for us uh and that's
 
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
so that's something that is much more um
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
I think Nuance to address it's it's a
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's a more
 
00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 align:start position:0%
challenging um uh threat to to Public
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
Health and so um there's that
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
so at at a high level we have uh the
 
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office which is um 52
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
staff I I uh as the assistant
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner I manage that that unit
 
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
which is basically has 52 staff um and
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
it consists of all of the internal
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
matters like HR legal um uh long-term
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
planning for the dep Department our
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
public information uh and Communications
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
unit that's uh really what they deal
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
with is anything that has to do with um
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
public engagement so that's branding for
 
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
the Department working with making sure
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
public hearings go uh well um you know
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
right to no requests things things of
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
that nature um and then we have the
 
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
waste management division that is headed
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
by uh director Mike wisat and they deal
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
with things such as uh ha remediating
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
and managing hazardous waste sites uh
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste remediation and uh Solid
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
Waste Management and um
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
permitting they deal with uh underground
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
and above ground storage tanks for
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
petroleum products uh they deal with
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
super fund sites brownfields um and then
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
they also have you know uh p in their
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
portfolio and what kind of goes hand
 
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
inand with that is the drinking water
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund which is uh an it
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
was established through after an mtbe
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
settlement uh came in and and that goes
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
to uh contam projects for contam
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
contamination drinking water projects
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
things things of that
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
nature um and that they have about 118
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
staff in that division then we have our
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
Water Division which has um it's the
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
largest division has 258 staff they deal
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
with uh Dam state owned dams and and
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
even uh we have we have more than 2,000
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
dams in the state but we have 273
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams um and you'll hear more
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
about that later but that is a pressing
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
challenge that we're trying to deal with
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh they they require a lot of care and
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
maintenance and uh historically we've
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
received Appropriations through the
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget to to do that but um you
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
know we we're really looking for a
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
sustainable source of funding to be able
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
to take care of of of the care and
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those operations and
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those facilities uh going
 
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
forward um then we have our land
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
resources management program that is is
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
uh really separated into four bureaus
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's the wetlands Bureau
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
Shoreland uh alteration of terrain deals
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
with large permitting programs uh or
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
large permitting projects over 100,000
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
square feet for the most part um then we
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
have watersheds uh our Watershed Bureau
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
think um think cyano bacteria that
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
sampling and making sure that we keep
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
our surface waters clean and and and
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
healthy and and alerting the public if
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
there's a threat there uh we have our
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
Wastewater uh Bureau and Wastewater
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
engineering Bureau and they deal with
 
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
large Wastewater projects um and the
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
regulations that go along with that they
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh we have the drinking water uh Bureau
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
which deals with um ensuring that we
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
provide funding whether it's through srf
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
or uh all the other funds I'll get to at
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
a later slide for drinking water
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
projects but also that we're uh make
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
that we're making sure that the Public
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
Water Systems uh adhere to to the
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
regulations whether it's federal or
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
state um and lastly a fun fact we have
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
the uh W winaki River Basin I think it's
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
the only state-owned wastewater
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
treatment plant in the country uh and it
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
and it uh has 10 communities that feed
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
into that around the Lakes Region um and
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
so that's I'm sure you'll hear more
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
about that maybe not in this committee
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
but out outside when you're voting on
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
bills if if there's anything in the
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget that goes toward that
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
eventually that goes toward that uh and
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
lastly uh we have the air Resources
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
Division which is uh headed by Craig
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
Wright uh he's behind me here and they
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
deal with the typical Smoke Stack
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
Industries um and regulations on those
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh mobile sources air toxics uh the
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
environmental health program that does
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh risk assessments Department wide so
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
they're not just for the air division
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's for Department wide uh for uh
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
Public Health threats uh environmental
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
threats um they also deal deal with
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
clean energy and and monitoring under
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
the federal clean uh Air
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
Act so this is just a slide uh of all of
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
our high level functions I've kind of
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
gone through most of those but one of
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
the things I didn't touch on is
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness and response you
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
know think oil spills um or or hazardous
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
waste spills we have uh a team that
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
handles those uh on a on a 247 basis 24
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
hour 7 days a week basis uh they're on
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
call and so if
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
if an oil truck spill's over or uh
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a spill somewhere and
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
and they need to respond to that they
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
um as as I mentioned uh state owned dams
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
are are one of the largest challenges
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
facing our department right now we want
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we are keeping up and and
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
have them on a 50-year life cycle so
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we're getting to them at least
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
every 50 years and so to do that we'll
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
need around $155 million per year to to
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
sustain that type of um maintenance on
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
on these facilities right now I I
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
believe in cor Cory Clark's behind me
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
he'll get more in depth on this but I
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
believe we're on a 100-year life cycle
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
which uh if any of you know a lot of
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
these are built for 50 year for 50 years
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
so many of them are in poor condition
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we've done a good job with the
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
resources that we have of keeping uh the
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
most pressing uh hazards up in
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
addressing those but uh as as Cory will
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
note there's a there's quite a bit more
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
that could be done to ensure that we are
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
on a 50-year cycle to to make sure that
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
those are being taken care of um another
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
thing that we're we're working on is
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
improving our permitting processes you
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
probably heard in the governor's uh
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
inaugural address that we are um we're
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
looking at a 60-day time frame and what
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
does that sort of mean for the
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're working very hard hard to figure
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
out how we can lean our processes and
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
make them uh better and and find a way
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
to especially for our land resources
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
management which is as I mentioned those
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
four bureaus that really deal with land
 
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.110 align:start position:0%
four bureaus that really deal with land
use

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
permitting um what we're doing is we're
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
putting those online we're making we're
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
creating e- permitting for those um and
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
as we do that we're leaning the process
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're going through lean events making
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
sure that um there are no duplicative
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
processes in place and that we are uh go
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
the extra mile to to meet meet our
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
deadlines um so there's that and then
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh L one other pressure that's on us
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
right now and and it's kind of winding
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
down is is the amount of infrastructure
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
funding we've gotten over the last few
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
years we've whether it's arpa we've
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
received $225 million in arpa funds over
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
the last uh since 2021 when that bill
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
was passed I believe we received more
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
than any other state agency uh out of
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
um and that really went to rehabbing and
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you know replacing uh state-owned
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
dams um drinking water projects uh for
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
communities addressing contamination um
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
and providing funding for uh
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged communities so uh we've
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
done we've done a lot there uh also the
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
bill money which is the bipartisan
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law that's something that
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
was passed in
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
2021 um we've received uh an enhanced
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
amount of funding through that whether
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's our s our state revolving Loan Fund
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
programs so those are uh low interest
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
loans to communities to be able to uh
 
00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:40.230 align:start position:0%
loans to communities to be able to uh
replace

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
replace
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um so we we've received
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of money through that and uh
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
and certainly the uh the IRA as well we
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
we've received and you'll hear more
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
about this later from the air Resources
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
Group but we receed some we're going to
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
receive some funding through that for
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
heat pump acceler a in adoption um so
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's a focus for us over the
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
next few uh few years um and of course
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're obviously always um
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
trying to improve how we how we handle
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
pasas and and contamination broadly um
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's something that I know we've
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
worked with various members of this
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
committee on uh in the past and uh you
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
know looking forward to uh you know
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
continuing those those efforts so uh I
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
thought just give a brief overview of
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
what the department does and then uh
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I I'll stick
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
around for the majority of our
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
presentation so um if you have questions
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
for me that you don't think of now I
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to come up and answer
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
those too so well thank you uh I'll take
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
the liberty of asking the first two
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh one is for my edification
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
the 273 state-owned damed dams are are
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
they all or primarily for flood
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
control uh some of them are for flood
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
control i i i defer maybe the Cory Clark
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
on that how many are for FP control and
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
how many are for recreation
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
but we have a variety of reasons why we
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
would have why we would have
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
impoundments but and there're and many
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
people don't realize you know Lake wiip
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
pasak even on on an empowerment so there
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
are a lot of um recreational water
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
bodies that we really rely on that are
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
held up by by a dam of some sort and so
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
um I think part of today but also this
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
year is going to be trying to educate
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
folks on what what water bodies are held
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
held up by that what happens if one of
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
those things fails um and just just
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
trying to educate folks on on why these
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
things are important so I don't know if
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
you want to thank you Corey Clark chief
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
engineer at the dam Bureau at New
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
Services and I would say out of the 276
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
dams that uh the state of New Hampshire
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
owns and operates roughly about 10% of
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
those um are designed
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
for flood control purposes uh the state
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire owns a uh a about a
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
dozen up in the baker River Valley
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
another dozen in the Sagan River Valley
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
and a couple other kind of scattered
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and a lot of those
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
dams were built in 1960s using Federal
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
money and each dam is essentially a
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
large earn embankment that's um has a
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
small impoundment but the whole purpose
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
of that dam is to fill up like a bathtub
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
during a storm event and then slowly
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
drain out afterwards and and so those
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
those dams are uh are purely for flood
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
control purposes the other big ones that
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
people usually know about hopkington
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
Everett um Franklin Falls the big Army
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
Corps sites those are operated owned and
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
managed by the US Army Corps of
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
Engineers so the state has no bearing on
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
those sites whatsoever thank you uh
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
second question
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
is the you mentioned the aror money that
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
you used to do so projects that's gone
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
now and so my question would be with the
 
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
budget reductions that appear to be
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
impending um what what you you mentioned
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
about reducing some bureaucratic or
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
speeding up some regulations or you know
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
processes what other areas would you be
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
working on and what do you think the
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
effects would be on your department as
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
we have to uh you know downsize some of
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
our budget and not getting some of the
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
AR not getting the ARA money anymore uh
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
which is a a a big chunk but in other
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
ways um what do you guys planning right
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
now to help with that so as far as ARA
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
arpa funding goes uh at the time and
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
this the last estimate I have I can get
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
a a better estimate for the committee
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
but at some point in 2022 I believe it
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
was we we had around two2 billion dollar
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
worth of need in the state for different
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whether it's drinking
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
water Wastewater uh those types of
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
things and so um a lot of that as you've
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
probably heard the go former Governor
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
say lot lot of the arpa money was spent
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
on one-time projects and the reason for
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
that was to ensure that uh we're not
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
creating programs that we won't be able
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
to sustain over the long term right and
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
so naturally a lot of I think we showed
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
bait through our srf programs through um
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
our various other programs that we
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
administer that we're able to because we
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
have the need and um there is the demand
 
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
there we're able to get this that money
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
out quickly and that's one of the
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
reasons why I think we we receive 225
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
million from uh gopher which is the
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
governor's office for Relief and
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
Recovery to be able to admit uh send
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
money out to communities for those
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
projects uh many of those projects are I
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
would say more than 95% of them are on a
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basis so you know uh phase
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
of the project gets done or a piece of
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
the project gets done we reimburse for
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
that on a it's depending on the project
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's a monthly or quarterly basis and so
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
um and we do have staff that there's
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a long taale that goes along
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
with that for compliance and auditing
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
purposes and making sure that the money
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
goes into the right spot so there is a
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
tail for for staff to be able to have to
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know monitor these these projects
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
over the over the long term over at
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
least the next few years um so there's
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
are in terms of reductions I you know
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're still working with the governor's
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
office on how how we're planning to um
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
you know meet meet any sort of
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
reductions that they're they're
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
intending to to to request uh I know
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
they've sent letter they've obviously
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
sent letters out to all the agencies uh
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
over the last few weeks on that um but
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
we're still working on how we're going
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
to get there um you know I I know some
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
of some of the things that we're looking
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
at are reducing the number of position
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
requests that we we initially had so
 
00:19:58.149 --> 00:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're we're
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
certainly able uh to do you know I think
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
what I've been trying to tell whether
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's legislators or other elected
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
officials is that you know less less
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
positions means we get less done right
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that's and there is a correlation
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
there you know so I think uh it's
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
important to highlight that um but
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's sort of where we're
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking right now is is requesting less
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
positions over last legislative session
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
as many of you may be aware we did
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
receive quite a few new uh additional
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
duties uh added onto the department
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
whether it was
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring um past
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
uh intentionally added P into into
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
products or um or
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
other food the food wasteband or other
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
other programs we uh we we did receive a
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
quite a few additional UH
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
responsibilities there and so we
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
depending on um where where those
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
reductions are are are targeted uh we'll
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have to uh compensate
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately with what we're able to do
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I've been at the department
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
a year and and we I would say you know
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
we we have staff are they they have a
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
lot on their plate and so that's that's
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
something that we're working with them
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
on and making sure they're prioritizing
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
the right things so okay thank you
 
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.909 align:start position:0%
the right things so okay thank you
questions

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh I think I saw represent kaplan's hand
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr Mr uh Vice chair and
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
last question was about you know sort of
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
short-term budget uh concerns I'm
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
thinking more of long term Over the
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
Horizon are is the department looking at
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh your needs long term in in light of
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know increased probability of
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events things like that
 
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.269 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events things like that
you

00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
know sure we so we we certainly are you
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
know a lot of a lot of that funding that
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
comes comes for extreme we events and
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
things of that nature goes to our
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
Coastal program for resiliency and
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
adaptation those are things that we
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
typically get Federal funding for um we
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
we are you know obviously we we want to
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
be careful about Mission creep but also
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
you know the those things are important
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
too so we we try to strike a balance
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
between what what's the policy of the
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislature and and allocating funds for
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
different positions you know we have uh
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
35 Plus State statutes that we are
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
required to administer as an agency and
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
so it's it's really targeting what's
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
what's the focus of those state laws how
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
what do we need to administer and what
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
are uh sort of things outside of our
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
statutory role to administer and you
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
know depending on what the reductions
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
look like we we you know there are some
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
things that we that I would classify as
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
um nice to Habs and and and need to Habs
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
right and you know the less the less
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
funding we get the the more we focus on
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
the on the need need to have right so um
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of where we're at as
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
a as an agency but um I will say we did
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
receive $3 million for uh establishing a
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
climate action plan we're focusing on uh
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
voluntary measures as part of that and
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
and we're working with different
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to get to a spot uh on that
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be over the next year um
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
and and so I think that that may address
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
some the longer term uh things that
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
folks could do to to reduce emissions
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
and things things of that
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
nature okay uh representative Swanson I
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
saw your hand
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
up yes thank thank you Mr Vice chair uh
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and uh the U
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
question I had was uh just uh to expand
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit on uh the the notion of
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams and there are army
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
controlled dams is that correct and I'm
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
going to ask a question out of this but
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's sub questions I have so we got
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
state owned you've got Army owned and
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
they're private owned in the state right
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
right but you're focused on the
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
state-owned ones correct so we we we are
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
focused on it for funding purposes we're
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
focused on the state-owned dams um for
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that there isn't a you know
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of event that causes a a
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
breach of a dam you know we have we have
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
different classifications we have high
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
Hazard which is um you
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
know it could destroy someone's life it
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
could it could hurt someone or or kill
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
someone or it destroys property we have
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
significant Hazard and then we have low
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
Hazard so we have different criteria for
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
for whether it's not based on the
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
condition it's more based on what could
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
happen if it's breached right and
 
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919 align:start position:0%
so um we we're focused for funding
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
purposes on on state owned um although
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
we we do have a responsibility to work
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
with municipalities or whoever the owner
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that that that they that
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
the dam doesn't doesn't breach if that
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense I don't know if you want to
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
Corey I don't know if you wanted to come
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
answer I think you uh hit pretty much
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
all the the points there um yeah there's
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 2600 registered dams in the
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire of those 276 are
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
owned by the state there's another
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
handful I don't know the number off top
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
of my head owned by the federal uh
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
federal agencies primarily the flood
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
control sites and then the last
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
remaining portion are owned by either
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities or privately owned or
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
owned by hydropower companies uh Mr Vice
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
chair a follow up if I may go ahead just
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit more for my education so I
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh understand that there there are
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
categories of flood control for for dams
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's flood control Recreation correct
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
and electricity generation I believe
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
I I think the mines Falls still actually
 
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.029 align:start position:0%
I I think the mines Falls still actually
does

00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
generation uh is are there any other
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
categories and is it safe to assume that
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
these overlap like Recreation is done on
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
damps that generate electricity yeah
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a correct assumption
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
that you know they they certainly do
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
overlap the only other categories that
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
we have if you have a storm water
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
detention Basin of a certain size that
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
could hold a certain volume of water
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
those are actually classified as dams so
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
um quite often those those sites you
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
know don't have any water and them the
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
majority of the year except for large
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
rain events around um various
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
developments in the state so there's uh
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's those that are also um included
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
in that 2600 along with um certain
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
lagoons um septage lagoons um storage
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
lagoons um if they are created with an
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
earth berm around those uh those are
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
also regulated by the dam Bureau as well
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank Mr chair Thomas I saw
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
your name up yes thank thank you Mr Vice
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here um always
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
a delight to hear from Dees um I also
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
heard the governor say that she was
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to push for a 60-day um time frame
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
for permitting for um different
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
Industries um and uh
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
building can you tell me how this would
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
impact public input and what protections
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
will be in place uh for to protect uh
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
public input with such an aggressive
 
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.070 align:start position:0%
public input with such an aggressive
schedule

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
so we're still assessing how how this
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
would impact the agency at large I know
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
we've had some uh conversations with the
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh at the time the transition team and
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
and now the governor's office on what
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
this might look like um but at this
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
point we're we're still establishing
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
what what the plan will be for that as
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
you may be aware of we have various uh
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
Federal overlays on our permit so like
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
for example the Army Corps of Engineers
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
has uh an over they have we have a
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
general permit with them and so that
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
overlays with our Wetlands permits and
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
there are various requirements in the
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
Army Corp permits that would would not
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
or potentially would not allow for uh
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
exactly a 60-day time frame but they're
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know barring that and it's really
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
educating folks on
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
what what are the requirements from the
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
federal government and how can we
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
incorporate those maybe earlier in the
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
process uh you know and and and then do
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
our state our state process and get that
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
to a 60-day time frame and that's what
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're really looking at is how can we
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
get the state of New Hampshire's process
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
whether that's um you know I know
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
fishing game is looking at their
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
processed with threatened endangered uh
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
species we're looking at how we can get
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
our our Wetlands process to be a little
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
bit more efficient uh to get that down
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
to a 60-day time frame or alter of
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
terrain we we're looking at that as well
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's as I mentioned before that's
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
large development projects over most of
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
most of the permits are for over 100,000
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
square feet there are some caveats to
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
that um but we by and large I think
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to achieve something close
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
to that for our state processes now as I
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a federal overlay on
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
some of our permits so that that's where
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
it might get a little tricky uh to get
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
there but uh you know it's something
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
that I I've been passionate about over
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
the years and and something that I'm
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we can with maybe new
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
technology or uh which we're we have
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
already invested in with some arpa funds
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
um and over the next few years we'll be
 
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.590 align:start position:0%
um and over the next few years we'll be
coming

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
online and you know a relook at the at
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
the state requirements how how can we
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
get there and maybe re maybe rearrange
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
things you know we don't want to reduce
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection but how do we
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
rearrange the process to be more
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
efficient for the applicant and and
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
easier for them to interface with the
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
agency and so that's something we we
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
we've historically done but we're we're
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
giving we're taking another crack at it
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you will um followup go ahead thank
 
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.269 align:start position:0%
if you will um followup go ahead thank
you

00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
um you didn't specifically mention
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
biosolids which are rearing its ugly
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
head in New Hampshire specifically for
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
PS um what kind of an impact do you see
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
um biosolid management be having going
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
forward it's certainly something that
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at you know we're we're
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
we're assessing that at at at the
 
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
department you know we uh some states
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
have banned L land application for
 
00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
biosolids that's that's not something
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at at this time but
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
we are looking at what what the
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate regulations would be on that
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
and I know that the EPA is also looking
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
at at that from a science science
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint and you know we're kind of
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
work we're working with them the office
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
of research and development to figure
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
out what that what that should look like
 
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um you
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
know I think we as I mentioned before we
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
try to balance the needs of a strong
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
strong economy with with envir
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protections and making
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
sure that those things go hand inand so
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
I think we're we're really hesitant to
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
do uh any sort of ban but we we are
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
looking at it from what what are the
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
what's the science say the right
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
requirements are and so um you know we I
 
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
don't know I have rainy peler here who
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
was who's in our Water Division I don't
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
know if if you want to elaborate on that
 
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:38.590 align:start position:0%
know if if you want to elaborate on that
at

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
all good morning for the record rainy
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
peler I'm the director of The Water
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
Division yeah biosolids is actually I
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
was just at a meeting with EPA and other
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
folks last week biosolids is clearly an
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
issue that we're concerned about we find
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire a lot of people aren't
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
interested in land spreading anymore
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
just because of the liabilities so I
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
think this is going to have to be
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
something that is certainly a focal po
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
point on a New England wide basis you
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
know biosolids every Water and
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant generate biosolids as
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
you well know so there's going to have
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of strategy on a new
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
england-wide basis it's it's just not a
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire problem it's an every
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
state problem uh at this meeting I was
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
at New York was there as well so the
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
problem is you can't just ban
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
biosolids if you don't treat Water and
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
Wastewater that would be fine you
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any biosolids so that's
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a major focal point in the
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
upcoming year because it's I know in our
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
Basin winaki River Basin plant our bios
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
sols are trucked away and the cost of
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
that Trucking went from 200,000 a year
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
to 400,000 and it was going to
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania so when you think about
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do here in the
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
future and Maine doesn't accept any
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
biosolid so um it's going to be a real
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
you uh yes uh representative uh scheler
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
scheller thank you that's okay it's hard
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
to get it the first time uh thank you uh
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for this presentation this
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
is great you had alluded to a uh $3
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
million to establish a climate action
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
plan I was just wonder is that a study
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh has that been initiated completed
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
where does that where are you in that
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
process so it's a it's an EPA Grant from
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
so it's a grant from EPA it's $3 million
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
and we are sort of in the midst of that
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
right we had our priority EPA had a they
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
kind of did this out of order they had a
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
priority climate action plan which was
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
really short-term things that we could
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
do we focused on you know existing
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
funding those those sorts of things and
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
that was really to get us ready to apply
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
for what what the under the IRA is the
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh implementation grants for for uh
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
initiatives that would reduce greenhouse
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
gas emissions and so that informed our
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
application for that we submitted uh
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
three different applications we had a
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
state specific one uh we had one uh
 
00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:26.839 align:start position:0%
Coalition application with Hawaii and
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
several other states and then we
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
submitted a third one which was a
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
coalition application with the New
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
England all of the New England states
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
excluding Vermont and uh EPA announced
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
last year that they would be funding a
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
four it's a $450
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
million uh Grant to the the third one
 
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
for heat pump adoption in the region so
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
it accelerate heat pump adoption for um
 
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
whether it in it's for businesses and
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
for uh homeowners ERS and it's likely
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a mid-level incentive type
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
program um we're still developing a lot
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
of the details around that at this at
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
this point um New Hampshire is expected
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
to receive 40 to 45 million at least
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
from that program um and again we're
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
still we we're still developing those
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
details and so the that those are the
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
first two parts and then the third part
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
which is why I said they kind of did it
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
out order is now we're doing some uh
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's a long longer term plan it's called
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive climate action plan
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
and what we've chosen to do is focus on
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary measures that industry could
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
industry could adopt and how can we
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
provide some sort of technical
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
assistance or or assistance to those
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
Industries to help uh get them to that
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
point where they would be able to adopt
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
various measures um so that's that so
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the the summary of of
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
where we're at at this point on that and
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's slated to be submitted to EPA in
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
December of
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
2025 thank you
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
y representative poi
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair and thank you
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner um going with the air
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
resources air monitoring other than uh
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
the federal Clean Air Act do you do
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
other monitoring of heavy metals radio
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
isotopes and the second part do you take
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
in information from universities or
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
private organizations that do do the
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring on particulates thank you I'd
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
like to invite uh some probably CRA
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
Craig Wright from our area Resources
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
Division to answer that he's going to
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot more information for you on
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
that subject uh thank you Craig Wright
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the air division uh
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
we do we operate a network of 13
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring sites across the state uh we
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
work very closely with EPA on deciding
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
what we monitor for and where we monitor
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
for it um we don't do we do monitor for
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
a particular matter and we do have some
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
filters but we don't analyze those
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
filters so we don't actually look at
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
certain things that you mentioned like
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
radio isotop or anything like
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
that okay uh is there uh do you have
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
other speakers coming to give up
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
presentation we we do so so perhaps we
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
should move on and we can ask questions
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
to those people as well so absolutely
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to Do's always open if you
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
need anything uh feel free to reach out
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
to me directly so and I'll be here for
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of the presentation so okay
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank so so who's next uh I have Corey
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
Clark here with the dam Bureau Mr Clark
 
00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
Clark here with the dam Bureau Mr Clark
welcome

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you community members once again
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Corey Clark I'm the chief
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
engineer at the dam Bureau at the New
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
Services and while this
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
um this presentation I'm about to give
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
gives a general overview of the dam
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the State of New Hampshire
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
what we do uh the various sections um
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see sprinkled throughout there is
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
some um hits on hydrop power I know
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
Granite State hydrop power is is uh
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
slated on the agenda to speak after so
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
they'll probably get into more of the
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
details but I'll be focusing probably
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
primarily on state-owned dams that are
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
leased for hydrop power and how that um
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
how that plays into how we actually
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
operate so just kicking things off here
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
this is actually um the hydropower
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
generator unit at Kelly's Falls Dam
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see later in the presentation
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
this is one of the the sites in which um
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
we no longer have a hydr power operator
 
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.230 align:start position:0%
we no longer have a hydr power operator
there

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
um because of uh Federal requirements
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
for fist passage at this location and so
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
Dees is now um operating the dam however
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
hydrop power is not being produced there
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
and so what we're trying to do is go
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
through various federal grants to try to
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
actually install fish passage at this
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
location but the $13 million price tag
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
to do so is is quite High given the
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
revenue that this generator would return
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
so um you'll see as I mentioned before
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is topic is kind of sprinkled
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the presentation so getting
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
going uh what exactly is a dam in New
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as we've kind of discussed
 
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
already uh there are various purposes
 
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
for dams however here in New Hampshire
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh generally anything over 6 feet in
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
height and in pounds water uh is
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
essentially a dam there are some nuances
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
such as the storm water basins um but
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
generally that is what we have here in
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as um the assistant
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner broke down there are high
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams those are threat of human
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
life significant Hazard dams uh High
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
Economic Consequences however likely not
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
a loss of life such as a state road over
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
topping low Hazard dams those are um
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
property loss uh not as high Economic
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
Consequences such as uh Town Road being
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
inundated and in damage and then we also
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
have non- Menace dams so the vast
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
majority of the 2600 dams in New
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hamshire are non- Menace dams those are
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
dams such that if they were to fail
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
generally uh they wouldn't cause any
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
property loss or any damage to any other
 
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.950 align:start position:0%
property loss or any damage to any other
infrastructure

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
Downstream so the dam breau was broken
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
up into three different sections we have
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
the dam safety and inspection section
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
the operation and maintenance section
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
and the engineering construction section
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll go into each in a little detail
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
here so the dam safety and inspection
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
section is responsible for the
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
inspection and permitting of over 2600
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
privately and publicly owned dams in New
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so as you can see in this
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
figure here these are dams sprinkled all
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire um
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
and what what that Dam safety and
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
inspection section is they treat all
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
dams the same such as any public private
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
municipally owned dams um are all
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
treated the same and so even when I have
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
to do a uh Dam reconstruction process
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
that that that permitting application
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
still goes through the dam safety and
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
inspection section for permitting and we
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
also have to pay the annual Dam
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
registration fees and other things that
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
every other Dam owner has to do um here
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the state of New
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the the largest dam owner
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
state so we also work closely with uh
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office on any
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions um that come from
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
any delinquent Dam owners and then we
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
also work really closely with the
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission so
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire country hydr power
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
dams are regulated by uh FK and so they
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
they do all the the permitting
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
inspection and oversight of all those
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
structures however we work closely with
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
them on all their inspections so this
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
top photo here is actually inside the
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
PowerHouse in Amis in Manchester and so
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
we we work closely with them because
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are dams such as that Kelly's
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
Falls Dam in which it was regulated by
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
FK once the hydrop power went away FK
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
went away now it is regulated by the
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so we we work
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
closely with them to make sure we know
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the state then we
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
move on to the operation and maintenance
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
section who are responsible for
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
operating 28 of those 276 State owners
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
dams those 208 are primarily made up of
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
dams owned by uh Department of
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services there's roughly
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
111 of those and then the remaining 97
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
are owned by New Hampshire fishing game
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
so we take care of all um fishing game
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
and Dees owned dams so that's everything
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
from opening the gates to let water out
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
pulling stop logs to let water out to uh
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
mowing brush cutting replacement of
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
gates things of that nature however that
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
inventory does include a lot of the big
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
lakes that we know in here in the state
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
such as lake wabaki lake winnisquam
 
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
Squam Lake Newfound lake lake sopy lake
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
oopi and several others all throughout
 
00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:37.589 align:start position:0%
oopi and several others all throughout
the

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
state the operation of Maintenance
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
section also provides real-time lake
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
level and temperature and precipitation
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
data at 31 Lakes throughout New
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you can see here on this
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
slide we have gauging stations at many
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
of those Lakes including also additional
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
gauging data that's provided by the uh
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
us Geological Service that data is
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
pulled in and this website is a free
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
platform for anybody to use um
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the um throughout the public
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
so uh anybody can tap into that and take
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
a look to see what's happening in their
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
Watershed the the section is also
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing eight leases
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
those are dams that are leased to
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
hydropower entities we don't actually
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
operate the hydrop power portion of
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
those dams ourselves we actually lease
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
that out such as I mentioned at Kelly's
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
Falls you'll see in your packet it
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually says nine dams I'm sorry about
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
that there so um we actually that
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
Kelly's Falls Dam recently this summer
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
um transferred to us so that's that that
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
wasn't reflected in in your packet but
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
it is eight dams and then we have 26
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
water user agreements so Downstream
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
hydropower entities actually pay for a
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the water that's released
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
from those sites so amamos that I
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier pays a portion of the
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
water that actually comes out of Lake
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
Newfound Squam Lake and lake winaki so
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
we get a small bit of income from that
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
and then the engineering construction
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
section is responsible for all
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams so that's 276 dams uh
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so that's managing
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
contracts budgets design of those re
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
repair projects and you can see here um
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere from right on the Sea
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
Coast to the Southern Tier of the state
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
all the way up to uh um the tip of the
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
state right up on the Canadian border so
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
we we inhouse have our own land
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
management section that op that oversees
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
all easements ownership records
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
everything else a lot of these dams were
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
built well over 100 years ago and so and
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of them were transferred to the
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in the 1950s and
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
60s prior to that the state of New
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh owned very very little uh
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
dams as far as a number and so a lot of
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
the dams the 276 were actually
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state through Public
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
Service of New Hampshire other uh Mills
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
and um they were formerly used for power
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
production but as they transferred into
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
recreational use they then transferred
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
state so that engineering construction
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
section we have our own in-house
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
construction crew this photo here is
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
them working at uh cops pond in
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro doing a repair project at a
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
high Hazard fishing game Dam and we also
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
um prepare emergency action plans for
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
all the high and significant Hazard dams
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
so the state of New Hampshire owns 64
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
High Hazard dams and 34 significant
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams so we are responsible for
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
all the emergency action plans should
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
there be a failure at one of those dams
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
knowing what would happen
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
Downstream so jumping over to State
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
owner hydr power
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
um like I mentioned earlier the state of
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire owned very little dams in
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
the in the first part of the 1900s it
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
was really in the 1950s and 60s that
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
this a lot of these dams were
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
transferred to the
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
state in absorbing such a high inventory
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
of dams there became challenges really
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
um right right as soon as those
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
transfers occurred and so trying to
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
figure out how are we actually going to
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
fund having all of these dams and so in
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
the 1970s and ' 880s there was a lot of
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of incentives for
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
hydropower Redevelopment and so a lot of
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
hydr power is developed at that time
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
through Federal incentives and the state
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
looked at several of their own sites and
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
actually looked at developing hydr power
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
there and so um under RSA 418 we've been
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
leasing those sites um I'll get into uh
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
how those numbers have dropped but since
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
the see in 1980s we've been leasing
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
sites that's been generating Revenue
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
into the dam maintenance fund and that
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue has been used for the operation
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
of maintenance and repair of state-owned
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
dams and so this photo right here is the
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
hydropower Dam at Lakeport which is the
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
the dam at the outlet of lake winaki in
 
00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:44.990 align:start position:0%
the dam at the outlet of lake winaki in
downtown

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
downtown
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
lonia so in 1993 when things were uh
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
when a lot of the leases were up and
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
running and doing well we we were
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
leasing 12 dams throughout the state and
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
it was kind of scattered throughout we
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
had we had several dams on the winaki
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
river dams on the bcat quag River um Pon
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
took up on the Androgen and so these
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
these were dams that were uh released at
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
that time for funding the uh repair and
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance of state-owned dams and at
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
that time it was it was able to cover
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
most of the needs uh of all the repairs
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
however since then we've actually lost
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
four of those so we've lost a third of
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh a third of those sites are no longer
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
producing hydrop power um Kelly's Falls
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
being the one that most recently stopped
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
proding hydrop power and while we've
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
lost amps our our income has increased
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
over time primarily because a lot of
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
these hydropower entities not only are
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
selling the power and their their their
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
revenue from sales have have been very
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
very stagnant since um deregulation took
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
place in the early 2000s however
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits and other
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
incentives have helped kind of keep them
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
afloat and keep them going and so we
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
have seen we still get revenue from from
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
our leases
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
um however hasn't kept up with inflation
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
um since since 1993 and certainly
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover the needs that we have
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
today so a little bit of a breakdown of
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
how we are funded and so on average we
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
spend a little over $7 million a year
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
and generally it's broken down into um
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
Dam safety gets a A little over
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
$600,000 uh from Dam registration fees
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
and some FEMA grants uh general fund is
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
pretty much primarily used for all our
 
00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
Dam operations so those gentlemen going
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
out there opening Gates making sure that
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
things are safe during flood that's all
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
general fund um positions and those so
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
we get about a million from that um
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
water user project accounts so those are
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
the hydr powers that hydrop power
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
producers that pay uh for the water
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
being released a little over half a
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we get from that
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
towards Dam operations and then uh
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
annually we see roughly $3 to4 million
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
in capital funds for Dam
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
reconstruction and then we have a little
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
less than half a million is spent on the
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh Dam maint through the dam maintenance
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
fund for Dam construction and then we
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
also have been lucky as as the assistant
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner pointed out we have um we
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
were able to tap into roughly about $30
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
million of arpa funds for the repair and
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of state-owned dams and
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
we have several projects going on right
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
now so we have some federal funds and
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
then really uh little over a million 1.1
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
million of General funds is used for the
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
administration of program so looking at
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
a in a whole it's about a little over $5
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
million is uh all general fund and
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
capital fund to to uh run the pro
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
program and then roughly over $2 million
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
in other F funding so that such as the
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
hydropower Revenue such as any other
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
grants is used so we're looking at about
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
$7.5 million needed
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
annually however when we look at the
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
actual needs of state-owned dams so we
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
have 64 High Hazard dams to bring all
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
those dams up to current standards and
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
put them on the 50-year cycle as the
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner mentioned we'd be
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
looking at about $300 million in
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
expenses and then you have 34
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
significant Hazard dams another 54
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
million 80 low Hazard dams another 54
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
million and the 98 non- menacing exempt
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
dams 6 million the reason you see the
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
numbers the the the the cost per Dam
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
drop is because a non- menace Dam what
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
that Dam needs to meet is much much less
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
than a high Hazard Dam as far as
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
stability as far as discharge as far as
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh flood protection things of that
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
nature but so you're looking at roughly
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
about a $414 million cost to bring all
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
the state-owned dams up to current
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
standards and this was backed up by a
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
recent study done by the Association of
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
State Dam safety officials in which they
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
determined that it would be about $990
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
million to bring all dams in New
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire up to current
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
standards so when you look at that need
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
and you you think about over the next 50
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
years trying to bring all the dams into
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
compliance we'd be looking at a need of
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
about $16 million annually in order to
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
meet that Target goal of making sure all
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
dams in New Hampshire are um being
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
repaired or replaced on a 50-year
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
interval and this project right here is
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
goose pond dam up in Canan this is an
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
ongoing project this is a 6 A5 million
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
project that is funded by arpa funds and
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
so you'll see a little bit more about
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
this project
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
throughout and as I mentioned earlier
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
and this actually these photos right
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
here are of Goose Pond the original
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
Construction in 1918 and then
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
construction recently um the average age
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
of state- owned dams is well over 100
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
years as I mentioned earlier a lot of
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
these dams were all built for uh either
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
um Mill purposes or uh or storage for
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
Downstream Mills such as Goose Pond this
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
this dam was originally built to power
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh Mills Downstream on the masoma river
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
all the way down through Enfield and and
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
Lebanon however in the 1950s the
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
ownership transferred to the state of
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so a lot of these dams
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
haven't been renovated in over 40 or 50
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
years and so we're looking at a lot of
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance and trying to catch
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
up to make sure that these dams can meet
 
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.230 align:start position:0%
up to make sure that these dams can meet
current

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
standards Hazard creep so 35 of the 64
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
High Hazard dams were reclassified over
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
the past 20 years
 
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
so back in uh 2004 we were looking at an
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
inventory of 34 um High Hazard Dam so
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
now we have 64 and the reason for that
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
is really Downstream development and
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
Advent computer modeling that I'll get
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
into a little bit more but you can see
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
here O Lake all those homes are actually
 
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
within the the the uh 100-year FEMA
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
flood plane so this is not the
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
inundation map of what what happen
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
should the damn breach but this is just
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
showing the number of homes that are
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
within the 100-year FEMA flood plane and
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
so it becomes a real challenge when
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to discharge water
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
particularly like last July or I'm sorry
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
the July 2023 in which we had a lot of
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
water all throughout the state and we
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
had to actually hold water back at a a
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
lot of the Lakes because if we were
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
increasing discharge we would have been
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
flooding people out for example I know
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
there was one home Downstream of uh Lake
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
W winnisquam in which we had water up to
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
the basement window I think for about a
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
Out Mr Vice
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
chair can we hold our questions and this
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
is specific to that graph I just want to
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
understand it okay one short question
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the little yellow circles what are
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
those those are the homes homes okay
 
00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:29.430 align:start position:0%
those those are the homes homes okay
thank

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
you so as I mentioned earlier uh the
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
other reason for we're seeing more and
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
more High Hazard dams and more and more
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
need is because we're starting to really
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
dive into uh how deficient these dams
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
are it was one of the one of the things
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
that we we had with the arpa money is we
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
were able to spend it on a lot of
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
studies and really dive into our high
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hazard Dam inventory and what we found
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of these dams are
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
deficient in the amount of water they
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
can discharge so if we had an event like
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
what happened in North Carolina this
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
year a lot of those dams cannot
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
discharge the volume of water of an
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
event of that magnitude also we also
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
found that a lot of those dams during an
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
event of that magnitude would either
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
slide or overturn remember once again
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
these dams were built in the 1800s there
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
are dams in which we've renovated in
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
which we're still finding the original
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
Timber down at the bottom of the dam in
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
the foundation with granite block on top
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't take much to move these
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
dams when you have storms of that
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
magnitude so then we look at Dam removal
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know how can we lower that inventory
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly have a list of dams that
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get rid of but every
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
time we bring that up it becomes a real
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
challenge with the local communities
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
some of you may be familiar with the
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
challenges we've had in the in on the
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
bcat quag River with the towns of gtown
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
in Manchester the issue there is all
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
three of these dams that you see here
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
produced hydrop power in 1993 only one
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
of those dams now produces Hydro power
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
Greg's Falls the other two no longer do
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
we lost Kelly's Falls that the hydrop
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
power producer this summer because of uh
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements for fist passage
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
Hadley Falls Dam hasn't produced hydrop
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
power since 2007 that dam is just the
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
economics just do not work out to uh to
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
produce hydrop power there and also um
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
operate that Dam because one thing we
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of the leases is that
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
when it's leased out that lease e is
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for all the operation of
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
Maintenance and compliance at that Dam
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
so it takes the burden off the
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
state so over the this past summer um
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
the committee to study alternative for
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
funding and operation and maintenance
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
ofair of state-owned dams um convened
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
under uh SB 549 that was pass last year
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
and they looked at um these different
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources and the challenges that
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
we have and these are just two two
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
comments that came out of the committee
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
from this past summer in light of
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide incidents in light of recent
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
storms and in light of imminent Revenue
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
challenges the committee finds a prudent
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
that a stable consistent mechanism to
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
furnish the Department of Environmental
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
Services with sufficient monies for the
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
operation maintenance and repair of
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
State own dams be established the
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee does not find the current
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
arrangement to be sustainable nor in the
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
best interest of local communities
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
recreational beneficiaries or future
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
budgets and so because of those findings
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
they they dove into you know who's who
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
benefits the most out of these sites um
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
they looked at everything from
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
recreational users to Downstream users
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
and really the committee came that the
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
the real beneficiaries are the people
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
that live around those impoundments
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
because if that Dam wasn't there they
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
would not have that Waterfront at the
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
level it is that they that they enjoy
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
certainly recre recreational uses such
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
as boers kayakers fishermen yes they
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
would be impacted if that dam was lost
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
but there's many other water bodies
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
that don't have dams and in most cases
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
the dam would still be present how I
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean the the body of water would still
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
be present even if the dam was removed
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
the level of water would just drop so in
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
the case of Lake winaki it would drop
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
probably anywhere from 8 to 12 feet if
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
if Lakeport dam was removed and and as
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
far as Downstream users go certainly
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
those people are um are affected by the
 
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
dam Upstream but they're affected
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
because of the risks that that Dam poses
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
on their property if the dam was removed
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
that risk nine times out of 10 would
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
actually go away they would be in a
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
better circumstance if that Dam wasn't
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
there to start with so they looked at
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
all those different things and came up
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
with that $158 per linear footage sh
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
line so if you own property on a body of
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
water in which the state of New
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire owns an a dam on that body of
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
water you'd be assessed that that fee
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
that fee would generate roughly $7.5
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
million of Revenue towards the operation
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
repair and maintenance of state-owned
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
dams and in order to actually manage
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
such a program we looked at what what it
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
would actually take and it would it
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
would likely take another half a million
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
dollar of Revenue to make sure that we
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
can manage that so instead of tacking
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
that on to the Shoreline owner the
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
committee chose to make the
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a $5 increase in boter
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
registration fees that would generate uh
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
roughly about half million doll in order
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
Services to manage such a
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
program all of that has been um put into
 
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
program all of that has been um put into
LSR

00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
202-6356 committee this past summer was
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
you know so what if we got rid of these
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
dams what would it actually look like
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
and how would it be impacted and this
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
kind of goes to the shorefront uh folks
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
so you can see here this is mum's pond
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
dam this was uh actually reconstructed
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
partially by uh the dam Bureau in 2016
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
and so you can see satellite photos of
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
before and during Reconstruction that
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
dam was um the water was lowered about
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
20 ft during that process so you can see
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
the difference there and the loss of
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
that Shoreline and um that dam is
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
actually going through another
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
40045 million renovation using arpa
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
summer going back to goosepond Dam as I
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned before this one's currently
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
under construction so we have a lot of
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
good photos on on this this this
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
impoundment also has dropped about 20 ft
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's roughly about when
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's full it's about 625 Acres there's
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
roughly 20 uor sorry 200 homes around
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
the impoundment I know there's a lot of
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
devel elent going on on the western
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
shore right now so that number will
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
certainly increase but through these
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
next couple of slides kind of
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
demonstrate if we either remove these
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
dams or if we ran into a circumstance in
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
which the risk was too great and we had
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
to lower the risk and open the gates and
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
let the water out that's the only way we
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
can reduce the risk at these dams unlike
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
Bridges we can't simply just close the
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
dam we have to actually reduce the risk
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
so we have to remove the water and there
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
are dams out there uh quite few uh quite
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
many that have have either wooden gates
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
or infrastructure that hold back the
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
water that really need to be renovated
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
you know pakway Lake for example uh has
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
a wooden gate that's been there for over
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
40 years that's 20 ft below the water
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
surface if that wooden gate was to fail
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
any day of the year that Lake would be
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
lost and obviously impacts to the
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
residents and uh pway Lake State Park so
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
these are the next couple photos just
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
showing the shoreline um when these
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
bodies of water are
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
lowered go Pond being one in which uh
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
the reason it was filled so high was for
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
that additional storage for the
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
purposes and you can see here some of
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
the original stumps that were there
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
prior to the impoundment actually being
 
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
filled and obviously those those
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
Shoreline residents have certainly been
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
impacted over the past of the course of
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
the past year and so we're doing
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
everything we can to try to get that
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
pond ref filled for them and uh and
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
their enjoyment so with that I know was
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
kind of rushed through but I will
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
certainly answer any questions I I I
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
would dearly love to and it's an
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
important and serious um uh uh topic but
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
we TimeWise um we we need to move on
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
right now for the our air division uh
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
because after all the air division is
 
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
one that's most prevalent to this
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
particular committee if we have time
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
afterwards or if you want to come back
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
later on I think this a really a serious
 
01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
topic it would be of interest for us to
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
know I'm sure some of those bills may be
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
going through the other committee on
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
resources and Recreation but that was
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
excellent and I think it was um quite
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
enlightening to know the full extent of
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
our our our damn issues and uh so thank
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
you so much for that I'd like to invite
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
the Mr fisherald are are you next or
 
01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:51.799 align:start position:0%
whoever both you okay fine please come
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
forward we have until 10:30 but we'll uh
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
we may have some leeway uh but please
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
brief on the probably the most prevalent
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the to our committee here so
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh Craig Wright I serve
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
as the Director at the air Resources
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
Division uh I've been with Dees since I
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
think 1988 uh all that time within the
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
air division so and with me is Mike
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald it's Mike Fitzgerald I'm the
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
assistant director in the air division
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
I've been with the if since uh the late
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
'90s and I'm a frequent flyer here at
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
the committee so you'll be seeing my
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
face uh for a number of pieces of
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
legislation coming up and also with us
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
is Katherine beam sitting behind me to
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
my right here behind me and she'll be
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
talking about past and air I'm going to
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
try to save a couple minutes at the end
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
for her because I know that was
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
something you requested uh this first
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
slide is just who our division
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
leadership team I'm not going to we are
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
limited on time so I'm going to jump
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
through some of these fairly quickly uh
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is if you need
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
anything from the air Resources Division
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
you can reach out to me or Mike or
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else on this
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
list structurally we have three bureaus
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
I want to go through each of those
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
bureaus a little bit so I'm not going to
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
focus too much on that right now um but
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
also we have within the director's
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
office not only do we manage the
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
division do the budgeting uh personel
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that uh we also do some
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
technical things within the director's
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
office and we'll hit on those as
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
well just a brief overview um in
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the state laws and I have a
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
list of those coming up shortly uh Ard
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
implements the vast majority of federal
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act programs and one of the
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
most important one of them we've already
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier a little tiny bit
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
is uh the air monitoring program uh we
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
also issue all state and federal air
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
permits so if you need a an air permit
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
under the federal Clean Air Act you come
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
to Dees you don't have to go to EPA Ard
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
has 12 sets of rsas that we Implement
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
and we have 38 Uh current chapters of
 
01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
State administrative rules and as Mike
 
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
likes to always point out we don't just
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
make rules up all of our rules are
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
founded in some State Statute or federal
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
requirement so uh We've also adopted
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of federal what we call new
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
source performance standards or national
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
emissions hazardous air pollution
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
standards and emission guidelines these
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
are programs that EPA implements across
 
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
the country but we adopt them here in
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and put them into our air
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
permits and we can enforce those Federal
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
standards as well Staffing wise we have
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
65 full-time staff we currently have
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
about 11 vacancies We are Never Fully St
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
staff I think every state agency will
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
tell you that uh we have a lot of
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
Engineers a lot of scientists uh couple
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
life science atmospheric science Health
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
Sciences and we even have a couple
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
attorneys on
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
staff this is just a list of all of the
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
statutes that we're involved in again I
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hit all of these I'll
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
just hit a couple of the big ones RSA
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
125c that's where the air Resources
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
Division gets our general Authority our
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
permit program is established there our
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
inspections and enforcement programs are
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
also coming out of uh that statute I
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
will point out RSA 125i New Hampshire
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
does have a state air toxics program we
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
regulate over 600 different air toxics
 
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
we've established health-based standards
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
for those compounds EPA also regulates
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
air toxics but they're they do it more
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
from a technology standpoint they
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
require certain levels of controls or
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
types of controls depending upon the
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
industry whereas we are looking at
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
what's the health impact of those toxics
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
so those programs actually complement
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
opinion uh one thing we know about air
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
pollution is it knows no political
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
boundaries so one of the things we work
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
a lot is with other states around us and
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
the biggest group we we we interact with
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
is what we call nescom northeast states
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
coordinated air use management uh this
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
is the six New England states New York
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
New Jersey all of my counterparts and
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
myself we serve on the board of
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
directors for nescom and nescom is a
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous resource for the northeast
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
states they are incredibly technically
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
capable and we rely on them for a lot of
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
support and uh we pay a small amount of
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
annual fee to them uh and we certainly
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh annual dues to them and we certainly
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
get our money's worth out of them the
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
only other one I'm going to point out
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
here is you can read um is the ozone
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
transport commission that is established
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
under the federal Clean Air Act and that
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
includes States from um Maine all the
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
way down to Virginia and again uh
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
there's a board of directors for that
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
and we participate quite actively in the
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
commission again I won't go through all
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
these just to try to save time but uh
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
one thing as an agency we take great
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
pride in is we work a lot with other
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
state agencies across state government
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
and I think we do a great job there we
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
have well long-term established
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
relationships with these different state
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
agencies uh regarding different things
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
that we may overlap with them a little
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
bit on or we have common interest in so
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
again I'm not going to go through all
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
those just to save some time um but I I
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
I do think that New Hampshire is a small
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
government and I think we actually
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
interact really nicely with each
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
other in terms of funding we're heavily
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
reliant on fees our our fees cover about
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
half of our operating budget and this
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
includes air permit fees from our
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
regulated stationary sources as best as
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
fees and we get a small amount of mobile
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
Source fees uh Prime when folks get your
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
car inspected uh when a station issues a
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker the Resources
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
Division gets a quarter of that fee so
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
we get about
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
$325,000 a year so a quarter out of yes
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you Mike we get 2 cents 25
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
cents per inspection sticker so that
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
helps support our mobile Source programs
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
uh including our on board diagnostics
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
program we're heavily Reliant also on
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
federal funding that's about 38% of our
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
funding um unfortunately this has been
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
largely stagnant uh Through The Years um
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
and what I could buy back in 1990 with a
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars I certainly can't buy
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
that today so we've actually seen the
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
number of positions we support with
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
federal funds decrease over time uh we
 
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
used to have 17 18 20 positions now
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
we're around 12 positions so and then
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
General funds we only get about uh six%
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
of our budget we only have four
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
positions that are generally funded
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
here's two of them right here so if
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking for cuts this is
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
obviously where you go first and
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
then and then we also have uh uh two
 
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
technical positions in our en
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
enironmental health program toxicologist
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
position and a health risk assessor
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
position and those positions were
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
largely created a couple years ago to
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
help the agency deal with the past
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
situation um the most important thing on
 
01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
this slide I'm going to mention
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
is air quality is really it's it's not
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
just about the environment it's about
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
the economy as well one of the things
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
that EPA does is they sets air quality
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
standards nationally and it's up to
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
states to Monitor and maintain
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
compliance with those air quality
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
standards if we don't meet those
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
standards then we have to develop a lot
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
of programs to make sure we come into
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with those programs and that
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
usually means regulations on our Smoke
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
Stack Industries regulations uh to help
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
reduce emissions and we've done a really
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
good job balancing the need of meeting
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
that environmental standards but also
 
01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there is an economic
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
impact to what we do go ahead
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
Mike again the federal Clean Air Act
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
that really serves as the backdrop for a
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
lot of what we do as an agency um EPA
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
one of the EPA this is the fundamental
 
01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
part of our program EPA establishes what
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
they call National ambient air quality
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
standards for these pollutants listed
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
here historically ozone has been our
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
biggest pollutant of concern here in New
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um EPA is required to review
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
these standards every five years I will
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
say they don't they don't usually meet
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
that but uh they do they do their best
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
to to meet that schedule uh when they
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
adopt a new standard then it's up the
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
state has to go through a process to
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrate where are we in compliance
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
standard again the most important thing
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
on this slide is is this concept of
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
non-attainment that's when you don't
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
meet those Federal health-based air
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
quality standards right now New
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in attainment with all of
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
the national ambient air quality
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
standards that's good for New Hampshire
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean we can just suddenly
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
let our foot off the gas pedal we're in
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
what we call a maintenance mode um under
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act is antib sliding
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions that basically says once you
 
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
get into attainment you need to maintain
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
programs in place such that you continue
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
to maintain your entertainment status so
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of what we're in right now
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
is M maintenance of of these various
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
meeting these
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
standards uh everybody every year we
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
come here has interest in our air
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring program I wish we could do
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
more air monitoring air monitoring is
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive cost effective wise
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
um it takes a lot of manpower to run we
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
have 13 sites across the state we
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
literally monitor from the top of Mount
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
Washington down the Connecticut River
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
Valley across our Southern Tier the Sea
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
Coast Area and up through the marac
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
river valley as I like to call it we
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't monitor for all those pollutants
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
at every one of these stations we have
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
to work with EPA to determine where we
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
Monitor and what we monitor for some of
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
these monitors are kind of early warning
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
lights for us like in Lebanon that gives
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
us an indication what may be coming over
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
the border from Vermont or coming from
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
our West
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
as we all know weather moves across the
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
country from the West that's where our
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
air pollution comes from too sometimes
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I would also note that we have a one
 
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
air monitoring station adjacent to our
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
office up on Hazen drive if anyone ever
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to come see one and also on top
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
of Pacman adok is an extremely uh uh
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
nice station to it's one of our our uh
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
Premier stations in terms of of all the
 
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
pollutants that we measure it's called
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
an incore station we're one two sites in
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
the country so if you're ever up on top
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
of Pacman adock I know representative o
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
is great hiker and uh we'd welcome you
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
to come visit us there as
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
well and I will just add um this is the
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
where we spend the bulk of our federal
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
money is on our air monitoring program
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
um we at least half of our federal
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
positions are dedicated to running the a
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring program um one of the
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
challenges we always face is up
 
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
upgrading and replacing equipment a lot
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
of our equipment is old and Antiquated
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh held together by some magic I think
 
01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
uh held together by some magic I think
sometimes

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
but but we've we've been investing as
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
best we can as a state agency uh
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
historically we've used a little bit of
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
capital funds to invest in monitoring
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
program um but it's always a challenge
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
keeping all these stations up and
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
running this is just some pictures of
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
our monitoring sites these are usually
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
stick built uh structures um I won't
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
spend much time other than uh they're
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
again they're neat to go to if you
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
really if you take a tour sometime you
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
you you'll be impressed with what we
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
have inside
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
this so just in terms of air quality in
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ozone historically has
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
been our largest regulatory driver this
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
is uh summertime uh pollutant a lot of
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
what we deal with in New Hampshire is
 
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
the transport coming into New Hampshire
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
again that's why we play in some of
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
those clubs we do play in to help uh
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
regulate the transport of ozone into the
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
into the area fine particular matter
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
usually this is tradition recently been
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
a wintertime issue primarily in our
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
Valley areas Kean is always our post the
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
child uh Kean is perfectly seed within a
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
bowl and dur you get inversions in the
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
winter and you get wood smoke build up
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
but I will say we've done two wood stove
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
change Out programs in the keen and
 
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
Chester County area and since we've done
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
them we have seen an improvement in air
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
quality in the Kean area for find
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
particular matter one thing new we're
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
seeing and uh whether you think it's
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
related to the climate or not but
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
Canadian wildfires are becoming a big
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger issue every year uh we
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
have seen impacts into Northeast United
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
States uh New Hampshire has not we've
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
made out okay we've had some impacts but
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
nothing like you've seen on the news
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
like in New York and Delaware and
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania we were just lucky I think
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
that that didn't quite make it this far
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
east it was due to a weather pattern
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
believe it or not and then Regional
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
Hayes this is just visibility in our
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
class one areas New Hampshire has two uh
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
class one areas up in up in the northern
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
mountains of New Hampshire these are
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
special areas under the federal Clean
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
Air Act
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we need to work towards restoring
 
01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
visibility in those those Scenic Vistas
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
to what they call Background conditions
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
by 2064 I'm pretty sure I will not be
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
so just real uh quickly I get asked what
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
is the air quality in New Hampshire and
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
this chart I think is the best way to
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
present it uh the each one of these does
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
our counties in New Hampshire our 10
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
counties and then our high elevation
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
sites green indicates good air quality
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
and we have good air quality about 90%
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the time about 10% of the time we
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
have what we call moderate air quality
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
where really really sensitive people may
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
start to see um some impacts from from
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
those pollutants and then we have a
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
handful of days a year five to 10
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
primarily ozone in the summer sometimes
 
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
PM in the winter um where we hit levels
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
that are called unhealthy for sensitive
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
groups what we saw a couple last year or
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
the year before with the Wildfire smoke
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
in New York City was actually at a level
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
three levels above that unhealthy for
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
sensitive groups so uh that's we
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want that in New
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but if it comes there's not
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
much we can do to stop it but we do have
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
plans in place we've worked with the
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health Services to
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
develop uh messaging for the public if
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
we get into those types of
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
situations thankfully we haven't had to
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
do it so um this ozone Trends across New
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is a a a success story in
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
our opinion the red line represents that
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
National ambient air quality quity
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
standard as you can see EPA does change
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
that on occasion as you can see it
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
always goes down these standards never
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
become less restrictive they always
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
become more restrictive as we understand
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
better understand the impacts of uh air
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
pollution but again as you can see uh
 
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen a long-term downward Trend in
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
our ozone levels across the state you
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
saw a real drop in 2020 2021 can you all
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
tell what was going on then covid right
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
people weren't driving as much Factory
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
output was down and air quality actually
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
saw that across the country so kind of
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
unique um just real quick um again I'm
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to jump really quick on some of
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
these we our atmospheric science and
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
Analysis unit this is the group that
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
helps support uh all of our past
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
modeling our permit modeling um they
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
also work a lot with uh required to
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're required to do periodic
 
01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
inventories of all of our missions
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
across our various sectors and we have
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
to report that to EPA and this group
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
also runs our pams monitoring sites um
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have two of them in New Hampshire
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's very specialized monitoring that
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
monitors for precursors of ozone so Mike
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
you can change
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
that um Kathy runs our supplementation
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
planning rulemaking I can't underscore
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
the importance of this group to the air
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
Resources Division uh as I mentioned a
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
lot of what we do comes out of the Clean
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
Air Act we need to submit plans to EPA
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
we need to maintain those plans we need
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
to have approval from EPA on those plans
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
and this is the group that helps
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
accomplish all that there group overse
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
also oversees our state rulemaking
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
process and then you can see the other
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
things that this group does as
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
well our a permit program again I'm just
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to mention real quickly we have
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
about 700 permited sources in New
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have just I think around 28
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
what they call major sources these are
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
Title 5 sources they're federally
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
required to have permits but again you
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
don't need to go to EPA to get those
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
permits you come to the Resources
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
Division as we maintain a fully approved
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh Title Five permit program we
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
typically get about 120 permit
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
applications a year you may recall last
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
year there was a bill Senate Bill 449
 
01:18:04.629 --> 01:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
that changed the time frames for the
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
quickness of which air Resources
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
Division needs to issue permits uh we
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
had originally asked for 180 days under
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
that we got 120 days working with Bia uh
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
we're now implementing that we are
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
finding some challenges to meet that 120
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
days largely because we're so short
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
staff we're about half staffed in our
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
permit program right now due to
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
retirements and folks leaving for other
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
um I can you can skip that
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
one so just real quick our environmental
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
health program uh this is a program that
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
sits within the air Resources Division
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
but it it serves all of Dees it it does
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
health risk assessments it looks at
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
toxicology um and it helps uh support
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
not only the air division the Water
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
Division the waste Division I and we'll
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
you can move on from that too
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
Mike we can just skip over this for now
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
just to save time just our compliance
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau this is our folks out in the
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
field were required under uh compliance
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring strategy with EPA to conduct
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
certain numbers of inspections every
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
year these are the folks that are out in
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
the field doing those inspections we
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
inspect all sources at least once during
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
the permit term so that's once every
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
five years all those major sources I
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned we inspect them every other
 
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
year so once every two years these are
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
the folks also we do we witness about 80
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
stack tests a year uh we don't actually
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
do the testing but the air Resources
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
Division is on site for all compliance
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
tests in New Hampshire this is usually
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
the company that we're testing at would
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
go out and hire a third party contractor
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
but we oversee all of that testing and
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
we review all the results
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
so I think Mike's going to take over
 
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.149 align:start position:0%
so I think Mike's going to take over
from

01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
here sure um as Craig mentioned our
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
Technical Services Bureau houses the air
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
monitoring program which we've already
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
discussed um we also address uh and I
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
have slides on number of these so I'll
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
go through uh mobile sources which is
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
air air pollution from cars trucks
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
anything that moves planes um
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
construction equipment lawn mowers
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
Etc um uh are all addressed we work
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
closely with regional planning agencies
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
in in the state to ensure that uh our
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
transportation plans are in compliance
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
with um uh the Clean Air Act
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
requirements um and we also house our
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
energy and climate programs and I'll get
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
into as the assistant commissioner crepo
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh EPA planning and
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
implementation grants that we received
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
recently um we also work closely with
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy on implementing
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
and the renewable portfolio standards um
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
and every year and I don't think there's
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
any exception this year there are a
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
number of bills related to those Al I
 
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
think the Reggie bills are somewhat
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
limited this year but um uh we we do
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of energy in
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
implementing those programs um um we
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
also work closely with All State
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
agencies to try to reduce energy usage
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
in state agencies through a entity
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
called esek um uh and uh then uh we work
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
closely with the the p doe and pu on
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
energy issues energy and air pollution
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
generally go hand inand um and so we try
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
to uh work closely with them on those
 
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
programs mobile sources as I mentioned
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation Conformity is an EPA
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
program that requires that State's uh
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation plans not impair their
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
state air quality so uh we have to work
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
with DOT uh federal agencies Etc um this
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
used to be much more of a significant
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
problem for us but as Craig showed you
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
as the trends go down in New Hampshire
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
um we're generally able to uh address
 
01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.189 align:start position:0%
um we're generally able to uh address
these

01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
requirements uh we do have the vehicle
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance and inspection program that
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
everyone loves affectionately the check
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
engine light on your your vehicle um
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for implementing that
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
through the EPA but we do work with the
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and it's conducted
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with your uh regular
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection and uh um as Craig
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned we do get a 25 cent fee for
 
01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:13.719 align:start position:0%
each vehicle that's inspected to help
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
run that program and some of our other
 
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
mobile sources programs um we manage the
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
granite state Clean Cities Coalition
 
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
which is a department of energy program
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
to promote Alternative Energy uh fuel
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
usage uh in vehicles and we have about
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
145 stakeholders it's an extremely
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
successful program that we work with
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
mostly companies throughout the state
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
that have large fleets like ups and and
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
so on that uh and and we work with them
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
to help reduce their fuel usage and and
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
reduce demand for uh um conventional
 
01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:47.390 align:start position:0%
reduce demand for uh um conventional
fossil

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
fossil
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
fuels um the uh major Grant programs
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
that we're implementing right now in the
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
mobile sources group the de diesel
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
emission reduction act we receive about
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
600,000 in funding annually this is uh
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
program started probably 10 or 15 years
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
ago uh by Congress uh I think it was
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
intended to be sort of a short-term
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
one-time thing but uh it proved to be
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
extremely popular and they've continued
 
01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
to fund it and uh and we Implement that
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
for replacing U uh older diesel engines
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
with newer cleaner um less polluting
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
engines and also you may have heard of
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
the Volkswagen uh cheat Scandal several
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
years ago that resulted in a major
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
federal settlement uh with EPA in the
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
state of California uh New Hampshire did
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
received 31 million uh in that
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
settlement we uh were able to uh put the
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
maximum allowed under that settlement
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
towards EV charging infrastructure 15%
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
of that um and we're in the process of
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
of putting those grants out
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
now um we're required to obligate 80% of
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
those funds by June of 2027 we're we're
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
well on track to do that um to date
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
we've committed 9 million um but we have
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
a number of programs that are in the way
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
in in process right now and we'll be
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
committing uh the vast majority of those
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
funds uh in the in the next year or two
 
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
so uh as the assistant commissioner
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned we did receive a $3 million
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
Grant from EPA for uh what's called the
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
climate pollution reduction grant
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
program uh we submit all the necessary
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
requirements that enabled us to apply
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
for the federal funding uh that that he
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh there was 4.6 billion doll
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
under the IRA to uh Implement uh
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
programs to address climate uh reducing
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
climate emissions we were successful in
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
securing the $450 million Grant um and
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'll speak about that in a moment uh
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
we're again as was mentioned we're in
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
the process of implementing the uh uh
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
CCAP comprehensive climate action plan
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
right now we held our kickoff last month
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
and actually today we're starting
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholder sessions on each of uh five
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
sectors that um uh you know
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
transportation and buildings and Etc
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
different different sectors that um uh
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
contribute to uh climate related
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
emissions and um so those events will be
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
occurring over the next few months we'll
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
take that in put uh and then we'll work
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
to to develop the uh uh plan that's
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
required under this and this was a
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
commitment uh to accept that $3 million
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
in funding and make us eligible for the
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
450 million um we're committed to to
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
implement this program as well uh the
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
heat pump accelerator program $450
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
million to five states uh that's a big
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
chunk of money and we are also getting
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
five states together to agree on any
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
thing um is pretty interesting and so
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of of doing that
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
coordination right now we have a very
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
aggressive timeline obviously we want to
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
get this money out the door and the uh
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
most significant majority of that will
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
go towards Midstream incentives uh for
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh heat pump installations so uh if you
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to buy heat pump your plumber or
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
your contractor or the the Home Depot or
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
whatever where you purchase that heat
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
pump they will have rebates that are
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
pre-applied you don't have to buy it
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
then uh use your money and then put in
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
money and so on those rebates will be
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
pre-applied and lower the price of of
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
heat pumps and U uh the intent is to uh
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
see over 500,000 heat pumps installed
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
the goal is to to incentivize over
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
500,000 heat pumps uh in the New England
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
region in the next uh next 10 years or
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
so um this money obviously won't pay for
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
all of that but um once we get it
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
accelerated bring the price down and um
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're hoping people start to see the
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
benefits and some of uh an additional
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the funds go into this
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
Innovation Hub which is uh geared toward
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
Advantage disadvantaged communities
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
low-income communities uh that that'll
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
be specific projects you know for
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
instance it might be taking a Manchester
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
housing authority building and and
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
putting heat pumps in there or something
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
but those would be specific targeted
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
projects and the resource Hub is to uh
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
promote education provide information to
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
Consumers and to share successes and how
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
to replicate what works very well for
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
instance the state of Maine has an
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
extremely successful program um the
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
numbers are actually staggering they're
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
one of the leaders in the country in
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
installation of heat pumps through an
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
organization called Efficiency Maine and
 
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
success um the regional Greenhouse get
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative it's just related to that
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
slide so I didn't want to let you get
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
away um so I I have been following the
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
heat pump the advance heat pump uh
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
funding and you said 500,000 heat pumps
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
is the goal for the region do we have a
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
number that we're thinking in terms of
 
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
installations that we're looking for in
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because I know when you
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
look at the eia uh one of our greatest
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
relian in in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
is you know the housing sector for oil
 
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
and gas so heat pumps would be most
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
advantageous to us here I think um do do
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
you have a target for how many how many
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
we expect about 40 million uh 40 to 45
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
million of of that funding to flow to
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
the to New Hampshire yeah um and we uh
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't turned that into a specific
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
Target but if you generally
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
um with these type of federal programs
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
10% uh if if it goes to New England
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're we represent about 10% of New
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
England in terms of population demand
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
for fuel Etc and so on so of that
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
500,000 gold you know you know if you
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
just trans transpose that it would be
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
maybe 50,000 here in in New Hampshire uh
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
but again not all of those would be
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
funded by this program this is hopefully
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
this will spur Innovation and and get
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
people educated and and learn more about
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
adoption of heat pumps there's been a
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
lot of progress made in the technology
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
over the past few years and so um we're
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan apparently has
 
01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.030 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan apparently has
a

01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
you gentleman for coming in this morning
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just curious uh what your
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts are on you know the likelihood
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
of getting that money in the
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
implementation grants out the door and
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
you know what would happen if those if
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
that money stopped coming uh given the
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
the incoming administration's statements
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
to date yeah um uh these are funds that
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
came through the IRA so uh one of the
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
constraints obviously would be uh to to
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
eliminate These funds Congress would
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to act to do that um it wouldn't be
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
something that unilaterally the
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
administration would do um we've also
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
been working with the state of
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and they've been working
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
very closely with EPA one of the reasons
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
our timeline is so aggressive as to
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
actually get these funds enacted we're
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
very hopeful that the incoming
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
Administration uh you know this may not
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
be a high priority for them but um I I I
 
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be well received to
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
take funding away from from states that
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
have already got it that's going to go
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of economic
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
incentive there's a lot of plumbers and
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
contractors and so on that will um
 
01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
benefit from from these not just the the
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners that that receive them so
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
should generate a lot of economic
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
activity uh in in the region and so um
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
but EPA uh has been working to commit
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
the funds and get them uh Connecticut's
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
the lead Agency for the five states and
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
get those funds in the hands of
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and uh and then we're
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
working to get them out closely but uh I
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
I would not Hazard guess as to what what
 
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
the incoming Administration would do but
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
we're pretty hopeful that this will this
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
will continue to move forward and and it
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
would take an AC of Congress
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative R has a
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh Mike you
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
just mentioned um the organization in in
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
Maine that has you said that been
 
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
extremely successful at
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
getting um incentivizing heat pumps out
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
there um efficiency main is that the
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
analog Main's analog to our New
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves yeah it's actually um
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
actually our sist commission used to
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
work closely with them uh so but but I
 
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a quasi Authority government
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
Authority program Vermont has a similar
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
program um so New Hampshire saves is is
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
the Consortium of the utilities but
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
efficiency main is actually kind of a
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
state agency um quasa public private
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
agency um and but they they receive
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
these funds they do receive they've been
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
implementing their program through the
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
use of regional greenhouse gas
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
initiative funds which I'll talk about
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
in a minute um so they've been around
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
for a while but they just happen to have
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
an extraordinarily successful program
 
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
and the way they manage it and and uh
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
and and get the funds out we we're
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
extremely impressed with with the work
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
that they've done I forget the numbers
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
but I think it's something on the order
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
of uh 20% of all heat pump water heaters
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
installed in the United States are in
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
Maine um it's it's it's staggering don't
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
quote me on that so M Mr chair I Mr
 
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.870 align:start position:0%
quote me on that so M Mr chair I Mr
chair

01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes I I am aware of the time as you I'm
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
sure you are we have about half a dozen
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
slides left would you like us to
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
continue yes solding through please
 
01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.590 align:start position:0%
continue yes solding through please
thank

01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
you okay the regional greenhouse gas
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
initiative as I mentioned I don't think
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
there's too much legislation that we've
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
seen uh in the lsrs to date around the
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
program so we're going to give it a very
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
high level overview if there is
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislation we can do a lot more
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
detailed uh if if if anything comes up
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
but basically the Reggie States uh are
 
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
are the states from uh uh Maryland up to
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
Maine um some states have come in come
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
gone out uh at times and so on Virginia
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh was recently added there in
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
K uh limbo
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
status this yeah they they're facing uh
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
some Court decisions and so um but
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
basically it's the states that you see
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
here uh working together to reduce
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions from fossil
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
fueled power plants 25 megaw and greater
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
in the region um and this was a program
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
that started back in
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
2006 2007 um uh Governor Pataki from New
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
York reached out to all the New England
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
states and said what can we do to reduce
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
emissions and uh we got 10 states to do
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
something that um I frankly don't think
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
could happen happen again
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
today uh but uh uh we continue to to
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
work with them uh the way the program
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
works is you identify the covered
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
sources as I mentioned they're 25
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt power plants and greater um so
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has uh four major sources
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
and uh you determine what the emissions
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
are from those plants you project what
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
the emissions will be in the future and
 
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
you set a cap um and that's why this is
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
called a cap and trade program you set a
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
cap on those emissions but under that
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
cap the facilities are free to uh buy
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
and sell allowances uh we create one
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
allowance for each ton of emissions so
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
if the cap is um for instance you know
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
10 million tons then we would create 10
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
million allowances among all of the
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
states that are participating those
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
allowances then for every every ton of
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
CO2 that that Source emits they have to
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
purchase one allowance and then they
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
have to True up um they can trade the
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
so facilities that emit less than they
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to can trade
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
them to other facilities that emitted
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
more um it's a much more cost effective
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
way it's very similar to the way um the
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
federal acid rain program which is
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
considered to be one of the most
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
successful environmental programs ever
 
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
it's a market-based program the sources
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
true up at the end of a uh of a
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
compliance period which is generally
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
three years they look at what their
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
emissions are they look at how many
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
allowances they have and they have to
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
surrender one allowance for each ton of
 
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.510 align:start position:0%
surrender one allowance for each ton of
emissions

01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh and the states manage this
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
cooperatively through an entity called
 
01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
Reggie Incorporated which uh our
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the commissioner of the
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
Department of energy both serve on the
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
board of directors so that's an entity
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
that's managed by the states to serve
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
the states and run one Regional
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
program um and so uh the major thing to
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
think about with regie is the cost of
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
Reggie is a cost to a facility just like
 
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of fuel or any other thing that
 
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
that that facility purchases so it goes
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
into their cost of power so when they
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
sell their power to the green uh
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
Regional grid they are including the
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
cost of Reggie compliance in that so the
 
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
regional grid price for electricity
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
includes the cost though that those
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
funds are then uh allocated the the
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
auctions where the allowances are sold
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
those funds are then allocated back to
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
the States on a PR basis and so uh here
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we use those funds and
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
apply them back to stakeholders to the
 
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh users of energy um and uh as a as
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
a rebate um States many states do do
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
different things they run programs such
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned the efficiency main
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
program receiv receives some Reggie
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
funds and so on and um uh so the major
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
thing for us to remember here is it's
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
better for us to be in this program than
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
to be out because if if we're out we
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
still pay if we're in we get them the
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
money back um that offsets that cost so
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
um there have been a number of bills
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
over the years to try to remove New
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from the program but it really
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
isn't uh doesn't make a lot of economic
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
sense for us not to be in the
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
program so with that I'm going to turn
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
it over to Katherine beam um she won't
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
say so herself but I will say Kathy over
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
the past few years has become a national
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
expert on P
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh air related emissions due to her work
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
outstanding work in um establishing the
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
permitting and the uh controls at the St
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
gobain facility in in uh miramac and uh
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
um she's consulted from around the
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
country on pasas a emissions so uh I
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
know she wouldn't say a word about that
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
but uh you're talking to a real expert
 
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.669 align:start position:0%
but uh you're talking to a real expert
here

01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
so oh you're going to leave her I'll
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
stay with her
 
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:23.860 align:start position:0%
okay you have control
 
01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
okay you have control
[Laughter]

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you committee for having me
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
here today as Mike the assistant
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
director mentioned I'm Kathy beam I'm an
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
administrator at the air Resources
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
Division I've been working on PS since
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
about 2016 and the PS issue in marac um
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just highlight two stat
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
statutory changes that have occurred
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
that affect pasas in air emissions since
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
the the discovery of pasas the first one
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
was Senate Bill 309 that was passed in
 
01:38:52.199 --> 01:38:54.149 align:start position:0%
was Senate Bill 309 that was passed in
2018

01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
that is the one that gave the department
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
the authority to regulate air emissions
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
that cause or contribute to groundwater
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
or surface water s u pest violations um
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
it also allowed us to do rule making
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
associated with it and then to hire the
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
toxicologists and the human health
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
assessor and establish those ambient
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standards and a plan
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
to develop surface water standards go
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
ahead so I just want to give you a a
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
status report on what the department has
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
been doing in relation to that Senate
 
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill um as you are probably very
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with we issued a permit to St
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
gobain performance Plastics in meramac
 
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
to install control equipment they did so
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
the controls were stack tested every
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
year for three years they were able to
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrate compliance with that
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
statutory change the facility closed
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
last year and has um pretty much been
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
dismantled there's no equipment there
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
now also under this uh Authority we've
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
been investigating other potential
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
industrial sources of pfest but thus far
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
haven't found uh additional sources
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
subject to the statute we have a very
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
extensive groundwater and surface water
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
and additional uh media uh test results
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
across the state and we don't see that
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
level of uh impact from an industrial
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
Source we've had some other locations
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
where either they've closed reformulated
 
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
or moved um but no one that's operating
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
today as an industrial facility we are
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
however developing a stack testing plan
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
because there are some concerns about
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
potential devices which would have a
 
01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:29.719 align:start position:0%
feed stream that would cause potential
 
01:40:32.589 --> 01:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
pasas emissions and those are are things
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
where you're using a waist Stream So an
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
incinerator um dealing with sludge and
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
any type of uh remediation of that past
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's soil or sludge and then um
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
also landfill gas has been identified as
 
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:48.679 align:start position:0%
a potential pasas precursor uh Source
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
but again that was a scientific study
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
down in Florida so we'd like to really
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
get an understanding of whether that is
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
really an issue here in New
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um we're monitoring any
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
new devices that are proposed in the
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
state that might be dealing with
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
biosolids or any other kind of pfest
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
Medias to make sure that they are
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
complying with the
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
statute and then as a result of that
 
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
stack test uh plan that we're putting
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
together we are evaluating whether to uh
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
proceed with air uh emission Ru making
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of that statute as you
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
know we've established ambient
 
01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standards maximum
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
contam levels for drinking water uh the
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
four Ps are listed here as you can see
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
we hired the two positions and we
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
submitted a plan to the state
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
standards the other uh legislative
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
action that's related to pasas in air
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
was a house bill 1546 which passed in
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
2022 it amended the state statute on air
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
toxics that director Wright mentioned
 
01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
toxics that director Wright mentioned
about

01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
um our air toxics program and it
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
basically required the commissioner of
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
the department to evaluate peer-reviewed
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
studies to determine if inhalation or
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
breathing in of P emissions would cause
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
a he human health uh problem since 2022
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
we've conducted an annual review we've
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
been involved in as commissioner
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
director Wright mentioned um we're
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
involved in many different programs
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation and and um listening
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
to different scientific studies and
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
results from other states um but we have
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
not identified inhalation exposure that
 
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
would change our assessment of the air
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
toxics program we do have a few
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
fluorinated compounds that are on our
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
air toxics list and those are still
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
being um you know enforced here in the
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
state that matter of fact the standard
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
in that in that Statute in the in the
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
rule from that statute um required s
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
gobain to reformulate way back in 2006
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
um but we have no uh peer-reviewed
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
studies that would change our evaluation
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
of that to date
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
and that pretty much covers what I was
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
cover any questions about
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
P representative Doug
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you good presentation uh as
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
you are most likely aware my district is
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh profoundly affected by pasas so I'm
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
I'm interested the um the the question I
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
have is the um the standards the uh the
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire preest standards that that
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
you list here I assume as they as they
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
apply to water um are they in line with
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
EPA so the standards you see there are
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
for groundwater um for drinking water
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
standards as well as for groundwater
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
remediation standards um I'm not an
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
expert on the water side of things but I
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
would say that these are the standards
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
that we have in place today EPA has come
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
up with proposed lower standards um we
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
have not adopted them to yet to date
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
because of the process in which that has
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
to go through litigation and and then
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
the process of adopting them in the
 
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:01.719 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
so follow up uh yeah and could you relay
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
to us what those proposals might be well
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
I know that poo is proposed to be 0.004
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion as opposed to our 12
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the other ones off top
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
of my head apologize for that
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um as you're
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
well aware we monitor Four Past
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
chemicals in New Hampshire however there
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
are tens of thousands of past
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
chemicals what is the timeline on
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
increasing uh observance of those
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
them do you want to handle sort of well
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
if you're referring to water regulation
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's um that's not our Arena as as was
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned epa's proposed new standards
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
um yes there are thousands of pest
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
chemicals and the evaluation of which
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
ones are are uh contributing to to
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
health impacts um is
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
currently you know a significant area of
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
of research um but as New Hampshire we
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
we are required to submit a report to
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature every year to review the
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
the the uh literature scientific
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
literature and make recommendations as
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
to whether these should be revised or
 
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
new standards established and so on um
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be submitting that report shortly
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
if if we didn't just recently um and uh
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh so we continue to monitor those and
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh also to watch work closely with EPA
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
obviously having a federal standard um
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know we'd want to coordinate closely
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
with them on on what what they do in
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
that Arena um I don't know I I would
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
just I would just add that we did do the
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
review this year and the department did
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
submit our report for this year we made
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
no recommendation to change our current
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
standards largely because we're tracking
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
what EPA is doing right now if and when
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
those EPA standards need to be
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
implemented New Hampshire plans to
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
follow along with those standards at
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
this point in time
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you um this
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
actually has to do specifically with the
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
air quality um I'm I looked at at the
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
agencies that you worked with um do you
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
link arms with the observatory Folks up
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
at Mount Washington and all of the um
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
weather research they're
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
doing uh rather closely my brother's on
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
the board of directors
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
so uh um but uh we we have not had uh a
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of communication with
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
them on this issue in particular um we
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
do we do do some coordination we have a
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh hay cam up in the White Mountains
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
and and so on but um this has not been
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
an an area that I'm aware of that we've
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
done any particular uh I'm I'm not aware
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
of research that they're doing on on
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
this uh topic but uh uh I will call my
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
brother tonight
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
and pl plant a plant a seed I do just
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
want to say this is a very unique
 
01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
situation from an air perspective
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
because it's an air pollutant that
 
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.709 align:start position:0%
because it's an air pollutant that
causes

01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
causes
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater uh problems and so when we
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
determine what emissions are applicable
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
we first look at the groundwater and
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
back that back to the stack through very
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
sophisticated modeling and so on and
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
then say okay this is what we can allow
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
out of the stack so as to prevent
 
01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
contributing to a groundwater violation
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
we don't do that with any other
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
pollutant um this is and obviously the
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
situation in Southern New Hampshire is
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
unprecedented um and we've never run
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
into this before so we're feeling our
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
way Along on on this topic obviously and
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're a national leader and
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
Kathy certainly is a nationally known
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
resource on this
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
issue representative schneller has a
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman uh if I
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
could just back up um prior to PS we did
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
talk about Reggie a little bit and if if
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
I understand this um for my edification
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
also for the public so choser keeps
 
01:48:22.589 --> 01:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
coming to mind the partner tale um so if
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
if we don't participate in this we pay
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
anyway so effectively we have to buy
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
indulgences if if I might use the choser
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh reference and we pay regardless yeah
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
those the cost the costs of compliance
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
with Reggie is embedded in the wholesale
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
electricity so when a facility sells
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
their electricity into the grid and they
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
get uh and that electricity gets
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
bought um and ultimately that cost gets
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
charged to you the rate payer um but
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire sells those
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
allowances our portion of the allowances
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
we get those those monies come back the
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
sale of the allowance um that that cost
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
is is comes back to us and so the money
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
goes in when you pay the electricity
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
bill it comes back out to the state and
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
then the state distributes that back to
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
rate payers so um if we're in we we get
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
the money back and if we're out we just
 
01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
pay and get nothing
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
back thank you very
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
much all right I'd like to thank uh all
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
of you for being here today giving us an
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation on the role of
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
Dees in our state and I'd like to
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
apologize to the Granite State Hydro
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
power folks um we're a little bit late
 
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
but um you're up next so come on down
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll look forward to hearing from
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
you I'll let you introduce yourselves
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
rather than try to introduce you myself
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
even though I know both of you well
 
01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:51.629 align:start position:0%
even though I know both of you well
welcome

01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully there are enough of those
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
handouts but if not um I'm happy to
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
provide more to the committee um so good
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
morning uh Mr chairman and members of
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
the committee um for the record my name
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
is Heidi croll um I work at J Grimble
 
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
strategic Solutions um you may know my
 
01:51:42.069 --> 01:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh jod grimus and Adam
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
Schmidt um if you don't know them
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
already hopefully you'll be able to meet
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
them soon um so I represent the granite
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
state Hydro Power Association um which
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
goes by the acronym of gsh
 
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
um meline Mano is with me um here today
 
01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
she works with Essex Hydro um which is a
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
member of gsha um and she is very
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on um all things Hydro so
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from her in a bit um gsha is
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
a voluntary um nonprofit trade
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
Association for the smallscale Hydro
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
power plants in New Hampshire um gsha
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
Members Own and operate and manage more
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
than 55 hydroelectric facilities um
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
located in 40 towns um throughout the
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
state and totaling approximately 57
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
megawatts so gsha member facilities tend
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
to be 5 megawatts or less um and many of
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
their members have facilities that are
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
below one megawatt um I'll also mention
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
that I um also represent madn paper
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
mills um which is located in Bennington
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um they are actually a
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
member of gsha and they have three Hydro
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
facilities on site that Supply about um
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
half of the Mills electricity needs um I
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
have two other Hydro clients as well um
 
01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
I represent Brookfield Renewable Energy
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
which operates eight um hydroelectric
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire um all of
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
them are on the anders scrin River uh
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
they they total approximately 45
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
megawatts um six are located in uh
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
Berlin and Goram um one is in uh dummer
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
and one is in AOL and finally I
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
represent um Great River hydro which has
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
um the larger hydros along the
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River um they own and
 
01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
operate six um Hydro stations and two
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
storage reservoirs in New Hampshire um
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
their facilities in New Hampshire total
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
503 megaw so those are larger facilities
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
um if any of you or the committee as a
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
whole is interested in touring um any of
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
these facilities small large or
 
01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between um please let me
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
know we'd be happy to um host you for a
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
tour um we've provided you with a few
 
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
handouts today uh there's some
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
background on gsha in there um as well
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
as Great River Hydro um and there are
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
two articles about the importance of
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
hydro in terms of uh um reliability and
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
grid stability um in addition to being a
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
clean and local uh renewable resource so
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh before I turn it over to mine I just
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to quickly mention some of the
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
benefits of New Hampshire's Hydro
 
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
facilities um at the state and local
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
level um as well as benefits to the grid
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
so um first these um facilities um they
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
are part of New Hampshire's business
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
Community they pay um state and local
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh they pay business
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
taxes lease payments to Dees um if they
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
are operating at a state-owned dam as
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier this morning um from
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
the DS presentation uh and occasionally
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
some water user fees um associated with
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
certain um State impoundments um they
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
employ local residents um in well-paying
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
jobs uh they contract with local
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
businesses for goods and services um
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
everything from parts for equipment um
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
to engineers and accountants they remove
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds of tons of debris and trash um
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire's Rivers every year
 
01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh with their trash rakes which
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
essentially prevent the debris from
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
going into the um into the generators
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
they maintain public recreational
 
01:55:07.229 --> 01:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
facilities including boat ramps uh
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
Portage facilities and picnic areas and
 
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
they provide a sign significant uh
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety benefit by monitoring uh
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis the water flows and
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining the dam infrastructure at no
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
expense to taxpayers so as you heard
 
01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
heard from De Dees this morning um New
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire owns a significant number of
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
dams many of which are uh in need of
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
repairs and um I believe you'll you know
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be seeing legislation in the
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
session looking at options for how the
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
state uh you know can try to fund um
 
01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in repairs and mine
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
will walk through this um more uh talk
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
about this more but with private
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
ownership um the ongoing and significant
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
cost of maintaining the dam
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as well as the generating
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
equipment is warned by the private Hydro
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
um owner and not by the
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um and finally in terms of
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
benefits to the grid um Hydro power is
 
01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
very reliable um if it's a run-of River
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
facility it is generally running
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
247 um except during periods of drought
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
or or when the facility needs to be um
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
shut down for maintenance uh so it's
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
operating um similar to a Basel load um
 
01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.109 align:start position:0%
operating um similar to a Basel load um
Power

01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
Power
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
Plant um if it's associated with sto a
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
storage Reservoir um like some of the
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
DRS along the Connecticut River um then
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
it's not only running 247 but it also H
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
can function as a peaking unit by
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
ramping up production um if needed by
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
drawing um additional water from the
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
reservoir uh so essentially the
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
reservoir in those situations acts like
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
a natural battery um and it's not
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
limited to the kind of two to four hours
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
um like some of the lithium um battery
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
technologies that you your committee
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
heard about yesterday um during your
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
discussions um Hy hyro power can also
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
serve as a quick start resource um and
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of a few of the Great River
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities um they are Black start
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
capable which means that um they don't
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
need to draw um power from the grid to
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
turn on and this capability is um and is
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
very critical for restoration of the
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
grid if there's a blackout and in fact
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
has served in that capacity um for for
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
New England um on a couple of occasions
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
so uh critical resource in that respect
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
um um so all of these features mean that
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hydro can actually be a good complement
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
to intermittent
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
Renewables um and finally Hydro tends to
 
01:57:31.709 --> 01:57:31.719 align:start position:0%
be relatively affordable um places where
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hydro is the primary um source of
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
generation like the Pacific Northwest or
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh Quebec um those tend to be um lowcost
 
01:57:41.119 --> 01:57:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh Quebec um those tend to be um lowcost
electricity

01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
areas um so with that I'll turn it over
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
to madin uh she's going to discuss some
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the challenges for hydr power um some
 
01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
of the public policies here in New
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are important uh to Hydro
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
power like RPS and net metering um and
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
conditions of the dams and fish passages
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
which I know are two of the topics um
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the chairman um uh had asked us to
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
cover so with that I'll turn it over to
 
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
meline and happy to take any questions
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
and look forward to presenting to you
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
today thank you thank you Heidi um as
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
Heidi mentioned my name is mamino and
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
I'm Chief Operating Officer of Essex
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
Hydro we own and operate 12 hydr power
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
plants in Vermont New Hampshire and
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
Maine and operate an additional to in
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as contract operators so
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day we're running 14 hydropower
 
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
plants uh here in Northern New
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
England um some of the industry
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
challenges and I don't I don't want to
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
be pessimistic I think we have a strong
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
thriving industry um but we do face
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
challenges just like every industry um
 
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
one of the main ones is is regulatory
 
01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
oversight and requirements um all hydr
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
power plants are federally licensed or
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
have an exemption from license but an
 
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
exemption doesn't mean you're not
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
overseen you're still very much overseen
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
by firk um that Come Those licenses are
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
good for 30 to 50 years there is a large
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
wave of relicensing going on currently
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
relicensing a hydr power project is a
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
many years and very expensive process um
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
we as the project owner have to
 
01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
undertake many many scientific studies
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
so state federal agencies get to request
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
any studies that they would like us to
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
do at our cost during the relicensing
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
process that can be everything from fish
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
passage to water quality to archaeology
 
01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
and historic resources and things like
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's pretty broad scope of
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
things that we look at while we are
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
relicensing a project to be able to keep
 
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.550 align:start position:0%
relicensing a project to be able to keep
it

01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
online um one of the directions that we
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
see as regulatory directives is
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to take away some of the
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility and really focusing on the
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
run-of river operation mode um some
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
Hydro projects have some capacity
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently in their licenses to store and
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
release water which makes them really
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
valuable resources as Heidi mentioned it
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much allows them to have buil-in
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
energy storage and dispatch um at will
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
when needed however um to minimize
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of reservoir
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
fluctuations there is um very much um a
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
direction when a project is relicensing
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
to either reduce or eliminate their
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
capacity to store and release
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
water we're very much seeing um droughts
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
and extreme precipitation events and
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
managing those is um challenging for us
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
um we love water but we love a nice
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
consistent flow of water um we had a
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
very dry fall this year that was um
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
challenging for us some of our projects
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
were offline because they didn't have
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
enough water to generate in October and
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
November which is unusual we usually
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
have really nice consistent water at
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
that time of year um it it comes and
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
goes but I have colleagues that have
 
02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
been in this industry for decades and
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
they say they very much have seen a
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
change in the frequency of droughts and
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
the frequency of very extreme sudden
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
precipitation events um that we have to
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
manage um and then I'll talk in more
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
detail about the cost of maintaining
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
large infrastructure like dams um as
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
well as fish Passage um costs so some of
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
the policies that are very important to
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
our Small industry here in New Hampshire
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
is group nit metering the vast majority
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
of gsha members at this point which are
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
all under 5 megawatts are acting as
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
group net metering hosts that means that
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
we've gone out and recruited a group of
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
electric member accounts for the smaller
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
projects up to one megawatts that can be
 
02:01:48.910 --> 02:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
private businesses for the larger
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
projects up to 5 megawatts acting as
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal hosts those all have to be
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
public entities like schools
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so we participate as
 
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
group hosts that means that we are
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
returning savings to those group members
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
every month um as we collect credit
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue we are then passing on some
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
savings directly to those
 
02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
members um another important uh policy
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
is the renewable portfolio standard the
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard is the
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
divided up into different classes class
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
4 was dedicated specifically to
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
supporting small Hydro in New Hampshire
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
um so that's very important there is
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
some gsha members that also have class
 
02:02:38.669 --> 02:02:38.679 align:start position:0%
one um qualification that means they
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
added additional New Generation that
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
does happen at some projects they'll be
 
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
able to put in an additional small
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
turban for minimum flow for example um
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
or things like
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
that so we were asked to speak
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
specifically to fish passage and Dam
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
conditions um fish passage can be a
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
really big part of what we do and that
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't really affect any other forms of
 
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
electric generation but it ends up being
 
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
um a pretty big undertaking at a lot of
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
our projects in New Hampshire in the 80s
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
when a lot of these projects were um
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
developed the focus was on Atlantic
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
salmon and Atlantic salmon restoration
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
that has now been abandoned so a lot of
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
those projects invested tremendous funds
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
to build fish passage for Atlantic
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
salmon um either salmon that were
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
actually returning from the ocean or
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
salmon that were being stocked in the
 
02:03:36.189 --> 02:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
headwaters by the agencies and um since
 
02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
that Pro restoration program has been
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
abandoned a lot of those fish passages
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
are now having to be
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
retrofitted redesigned upgraded because
 
02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
the focus species for fish passage are
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
now River Herring American shad and
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
American eel
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
which have very different needs than a
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
salmon so having a fish ladder is not
 
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
sort of you check a box and you're good
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
um as needs for different Focus
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
restoration species change um sometimes
 
02:04:09.629 --> 02:04:09.639 align:start position:0%
we have to completely redesign and
 
02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
rebuild a fish passage for example that
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
comes up a lot in relicensing so there's
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of focus in relicensing on fish
 
02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
passages um I mentioned one of the focus
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
species is American eel
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
um Downstream passage for eel is
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging currently a lot of
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
the hydros will just shut down at night
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
during Downstream eel passage season
 
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
either after certain precipitation
 
02:04:39.549 --> 02:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
events or um because there's currently
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
no better way at those facilities to be
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
able to make sure that eels migrate
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
Downstream they migrate at night
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
preferably after precipitation events so
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
some facilities for three nights after
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
it rains they have to shut down their
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
operations completely so that the eels
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
can pass safely without going into the
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
turbines in relicensing we are looking
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
at very narrow trash racks so trash
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
racks are the metal bars in front of our
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
intakes that prevent usually debris from
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
going into the turbine but it also
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
prevents fish from going into the
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
turbine for eels the spacing between the
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
bars has to be 3/4 inch which is then
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging for us to manage
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
having that not get clogged up with
 
02:05:21.239 --> 02:05:22.390 align:start position:0%
having that not get clogged up with
debris

02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
debris
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
just preventing the water flow so in
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
several instances we're having to
 
02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
completely redesign the intake of the
 
02:05:31.549 --> 02:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
hydro project so that we can accommodate
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
these very narrow racks to direct the
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
eels away from the intake to a safe
 
02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
eels away from the intake to a safe
Downstream

02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
Downstream
 
02:05:39.199 --> 02:05:42.709 align:start position:0%
Downstream
passage

02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the relensing process itself um is
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
costly as I mentioned um but in order to
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
agree to come to an agreement with the
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
agencies and so when I talk about
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
agencies I'm talking about uh several
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies are involved us fish
 
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
and wildlife uh Noah Marine fishery
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
Service as well as our local fishing
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
game uh
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
agency so in order to get them to agree
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
that a Hydro power project will get a
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
new license we often have to agree to
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
Future fish passage improvements um so
 
02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
I'm currently relicensing our three
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
projects on the kukuk river here in
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
Penacook at our Penacook la Falls for
 
02:06:25.629 --> 02:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
example we're looking at an roughly $1
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
million investment in future fish
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
passage so that will mean completely
 
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
redesigning the intake for Downstream
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
eel passage as well as eventually once
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
the projects on the marac can pass
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
Upstream fish we'll have to put Upstream
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
fish passage there as well we're
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
fortunate that with those three projects
 
02:06:47.709 --> 02:06:47.719 align:start position:0%
we're able to sort of group The
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
Investments at one of the project to
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
avoid Investments at the other projects
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
because they're extremely close together
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
in two miles of river so we're currently
 
02:06:58.109 --> 02:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
planning to do what's called trap and
 
02:07:00.549 --> 02:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
truck at the downstream pass Downstream
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
project where we will pass the fish but
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
put them in a truck and literally drive
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
them to the Upstream um project so The
 
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
Upfront in infrastructure Investments
 
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
are one thing but the ongoing operation
 
02:07:17.549 --> 02:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
and maintenance cost of fish passages
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
are a whole other thing So currently at
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
our at some of our other projects that
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
where we run fish passages we have to
 
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
hire additional seasonal staff to run
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
our fish
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
passages exclusively so we hire
 
02:07:32.189 --> 02:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
additional staff just to do that um so
 
02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
it is a significant
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
cost um unfortunately some fish passage
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
costs in relicensing have led to hydr
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
power owners abandoning projects um
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's happened at one of the state hone
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
dams on the Sagan River um a very small
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
project obviously only Mak so much
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
revenue and at some point there's no
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
economy of scale and the costs can be so
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
big to relicense the project that they
 
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
the project owner says it will never
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
make economic sense for me to put in
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
this fish passage which is really
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because I think it's very
 
02:08:11.549 --> 02:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
important to keep these resources that
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
we currently have it's very challenging
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
to site and interconnect new electricity
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
generating resources so keeping the
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
resources we currently have on online
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
and available um is really important and
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
then if a hydrop power project owner
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
abandons the project relinquishes the
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
license that environmental Improvement
 
02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
of fish passage won't get done because
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's no longer a regulatory Avenue to
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
require it and the dam probably won't be
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
maintained as well as it used to so it's
 
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a win-win for
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
anyone um so that's fish passage and
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
then as far as dam condition I know you
 
02:08:53.069 --> 02:08:53.079 align:start position:0%
heard from the dam Bureau earlier
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
um dams that have operating hydr power
 
02:08:59.950 --> 02:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
tend to be much better maintained than
 
02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
then dams that may be only there for
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
recreation or they used to have a
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
purpose for a mill but they're no longer
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
there there's a present owner there are
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
operators and there is also a source of
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue to support the infrastructure
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
needs for that Dam um but dams are a
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
major infrastructure and they are in
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
water and they need to be maintained um
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
we take that responsibility very
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
seriously they have to be maintained in
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
good uh condition for public safety
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
reasons we um we have staff available
 
02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
247 to respond to emergencies we have a
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
lot of sensors and alarms and monitors
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
at all of our projects that monitor
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
conditions both of the power generating
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
equipment but as well as water levels um
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
and things like that so we also under
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
regular inspections with fate state and
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
federal agencies to make sure that the
 
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
dams are safe and well maintained and
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of annual tests so we
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
have to show that our gates can open and
 
02:10:06.510 --> 02:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
close and we have to document that and
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
certify that um as well as having lots
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
of emergency plans uh in case of any
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
kind of emergency situation that may uh
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
arise um you know there are some dams
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
that are very old that require major
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
maintenance but even more modern dams
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
require uh regular upkeep uh regular
 
02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance that we've done to our dams
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
for example can be relining a pen stock
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
a pen stock is the big pipe that brings
 
02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
water from the intake to the turbine uh
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
some are very short but some can be half
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
a mile long so we're talking about uh a
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
really big pipe that can be really
 
02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:46.830 align:start position:0%
really big pipe that can be really
expensive

02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
um uh refacing spillways most dams are
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
made out of concrete concrete degrades
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
over time we uh we have a good concrete
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
contractor and we keep them in business
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
let me tell you um replacing or
 
02:11:02.350 --> 02:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
upgrading Gates so there are all sorts
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
of different types of gates that can
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
bypass water um in order when we get
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
those flows that are more water than we
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
can put through our power generating
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
equipment we have to bypass that water
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
that can be done through Gates sometimes
 
02:11:18.549 --> 02:11:18.559 align:start position:0%
it's through spillways so um we have to
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
maintain that equipment and because it's
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
in water a lot of times steel rusts and
 
02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
wood degrades and so it has to be
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
maintained and replaced on a regular
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
basis there is an increased concern
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
about extreme storms and flood events um
 
02:11:36.669 --> 02:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
certainly from The Regulators and that's
 
02:11:38.549 --> 02:11:38.559 align:start position:0%
driving a lot of requirements and
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
oversight to be able to
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
bypass more uh larger flood capacities
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
so dams are built to be able to safely
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
pass a certain uh magnitude of flood
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
flows and and as we are you know
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
updating data and looking at different
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
um more recent precipitation events and
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
flood events there is definitely a push
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
to move to beefing up our dams to be
 
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
able to pass more flows safely and that
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
can be extremely costly um there was
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
recently a round of federal grants
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
through the bipartisan infrastructure
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
law that was implemented through uh the
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
US doe lots of gsha members got some of
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
those grants we were fortunate to get
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
two of them um and those are extremely
 
02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
helpful one there was three topics that
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
those grants funded one was fish one was
 
02:12:31.390 --> 02:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
environmental improvements which most of
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
the applicants and grants are going to
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
fish passage one was um Dam safety and
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and so that was also
 
02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful to get some of those
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
grants to fund some of those projects
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
the grants fund a third of the project
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
cost and so we are certainly still
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
putting in quite a bit of our own
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
funding that's everything that I had yep
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
and I was just going to add before we go
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
to questions um Mr chairman um I think
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
we heard this morning um that the
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
state-owned facility I think it's Kelly
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
Falls um that um where there had been a
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's a state owned Dam a hydro facility
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
there that was being leased um The
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
Entity that was leasing um has uh exited
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
the lease at at its expiration and I
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
think we heard this morning that the
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
fish passage there was is a $13 million
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
price tag to that
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
um and I think mine mentioned this but I
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to emphasize it too that
 
02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
with the fist passages not only do you
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
have these additional costs both for the
 
02:13:33.870 --> 02:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
initial investment and the operation and
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance but it it can require
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
passing less water through the facility
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
to and so a reduction in the ability to
 
02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
generate power um in terms of
 
02:13:47.549 --> 02:13:47.559 align:start position:0%
relicensing um manad paper mills for
 
02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
example relicensed its three facilities
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of
 
02:13:53.229 --> 02:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
probably at this point maybe four or
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
five years ago that was a seven-year
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
process for them um another one um Great
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
River Hydro is going through some
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
relicensing I think they're in year 11
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
um so these are not short Endeavors um
 
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
and as mine said you know there's
 
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:10.559 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars that
 
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
are spent um on Experts and consultants
 
02:14:17.069 --> 02:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
and attorneys um not to mention staff
 
02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:19.559 align:start position:0%
time and resources um the final thing I
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to add um with respect to net
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
metering um under the municipal host or
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
Municipal group net metering is that the
 
02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
state um Can is a participant or is now
 
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to uh be um an end user in that
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
Arrangement and um I we do know that
 
02:14:37.870 --> 02:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
there are a number of state agencies
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
that are actually taking advantage of
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
that and so the state and state
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are seeing the benefits of net
 
02:14:45.549 --> 02:14:45.559 align:start position:0%
metering with some local hydro which is
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
really good to see
 
02:14:50.589 --> 02:14:50.599 align:start position:0%
so okay well thank you very much to both
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
of you
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
M Mano I was particularly intrigued by
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
your discussion of reservoirs and the
 
02:15:03.069 --> 02:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
potential for using those almost like
 
02:15:03.079 --> 02:15:04.430 align:start position:0%
potential for using those almost like
battery

02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
battery
 
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
storage now we know that lithium ion
 
02:15:08.669 --> 02:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
battery storage is very expensive
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
something on the order of half a million
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
dollars a megawatt
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
hour is there any way to
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
calculate what Reservoir storage might
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
cost or might be worth and is there any
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
way to monetize it it it doesn't cost
 
02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
anything so the the Regulatory Agencies
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
would just have to tell us so currently
 
02:15:33.790 --> 02:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
in our licenses for example at our local
 
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
projects here it says we must maintain
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
our impoundment at a steady level and we
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
must only generate with the water that
 
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
comes to us as it comes to us at one of
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
our uh we have a series of projects in
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
Maine and at there we control the water
 
02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
in a lake and we have a 1ot level within
 
02:15:58.750 --> 02:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
which we can keep that lake level so
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
that allows us the ability to store up
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
to a foot of water over the entire area
 
02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
of the reservoir and then we discharge
 
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
the water when it's needed or when we
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
want and then we own four hydros
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
Downstream of that Reservoir and so we
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
effectively can decide when to release
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
the water and when to not release it and
 
02:16:24.189 --> 02:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
it's still quite controlled of you know
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining within a foot there's a lot
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
of properties on that Reservoir and um
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
they keep a very close eye on us and if
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know they're very unhappy if we
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
change it too much but um similarly um
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know the the projects on the
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River have had some of that
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility and it's been a challenge in
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
relicensing to maintain some of it
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
they've been very creative to be able to
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't cost anything
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
the reason why Regulatory Agencies don't
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
like it some of it is the the residents
 
02:17:01.309 --> 02:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
on those reservoirs are annoyed when the
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
water level changes regularly but some
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
of it is the environmental impact of
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
having the water level changing in an
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
unnatural manner so is there any way to
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
value that foot of water in terms of
 
02:17:19.469 --> 02:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour potential yeah I can't
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
tell you off the top of my head but for
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
example it would allow us instead of
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
generating at night when power is not
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
really needed and really cheap we could
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
generate at maximum power you know
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
instead of generating at half power 247
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
we could pause operations at night and
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
then generate at full power between 400
 
02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
p.m. and 8:00 P.M when that demand when
 
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
solar is going down and that demand is
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
ramping up so that price differential
 
02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:51.870 align:start position:0%
ramping up so that price differential
between

02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
um nighttime generation and peak time
 
02:17:57.389 --> 02:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
generation is a value as well as the
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
price suppression of having additional
 
02:18:02.429 --> 02:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
Supply during those times of peak
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
demand but I don't know the value off
 
02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but it's quite
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
valuable I think it would be Mr chairman
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
I can um check with Great River hydro
 
02:18:12.669 --> 02:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
and see if they have any additional
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
information that might help respond to
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
your question I I don't know any I don't
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
have an answer off the top of my head
 
02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
but I will
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
ask okay thank you further questions
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Corman
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
has one thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
you both for coming here I'm just
 
02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
curious um when when a dam is actually
 
02:18:37.469 --> 02:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
um getting uh I guess a a a bid or
 
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
something like that are you typically in
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
the day ahead Market I guess that's what
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for day ahead Market
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts spot market and also
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
can you give me some sort of ballpark as
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
to what you get per megawatt hour so as
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
I mentioned a lot of of gsha members are
 
02:18:59.790 --> 02:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
group nit metering hosts so in that case
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're getting whichever the host
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
utilities default service rate is just
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
the energy and so new prices just came
 
02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
out for February 1st in Unitil territory
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 7.8 cents for the
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
next six months I mentioned however that
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have group members and we're
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
returning savings to the those group
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
members so we're not keeping the whole
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
7.8 cents we're then giving a contracted
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
amount back to those members it could be
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
a percentage it could be a flat amount
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
whatever that is for the electricity
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
that they represent in our group um
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
certainly some members are on power
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement as far as gsha
 
02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
members the very small
 
02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.629 align:start position:0%
members the very small
ones

02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
ones
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
not as far as I'm aware I don't think
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
any of them are in the spot Market or
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market markets they either
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
have power purchase agreements or our
 
02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
group net metering
 
02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:57.309 align:start position:0%
group net metering
hosts

02:19:57.309 --> 02:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
hosts
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
followup yes follow um how about the
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
really big ones like Mor and
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
cumerford I'll have to get back to you
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
on that question um I suspect it's
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
probably a mix of contracts and
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
participating in the spot Market but let
 
02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:15.150 align:start position:0%
participating in the spot Market but let
me

02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
check representative McGee has a
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and nice
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
to see you again mine
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you both for being here this
 
02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
morning um my question has to do with
 
02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
you know we have quite a few bills
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
coming through this year that relate to
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
um that influence the market and uh it
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
sounds to me and I've always felt that
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
the small Hydro in New Hampshire is um
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
is um a major benefit and we certainly
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose um what we have and
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
you've given examples here this morning
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
of folks going under based on not being
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
able to meet a margin that's reasonable
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
to keep them in business so can you
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
speak to we we definitely even have a
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill to consider phasing out the RPS and
 
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious if you could speak to us
 
02:21:11.070 --> 02:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
about uh what role the RPS plays in your
 
02:21:13.389 --> 02:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
margins that that would be the question
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
sure um so the New Hampshire RPS as I
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned class four is specifically for
 
02:21:22.349 --> 02:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
small Hydro there are very specific
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
requirements to qualify so if you're
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
over a megawatt for example you have to
 
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
have upstream and downstream fish
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
passage regardless of what your license
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
requires which does not make a lot of
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
sense so for example our our facilities
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
in Penacook are not class 4 qualified
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
because our licenses don't say they have
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
to have Upstream fish passage yet so we
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
would not put in fish passage just to
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
qualify for New Hampshire class fours um
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
they are qualified other states um but
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the the facilities that do qualify
 
02:21:59.230 --> 02:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
and the smaller facilities um it's an
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
additional two to three cents a kilowatt
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
hour of Revenue or 20 to $30 a megawatt
 
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
hour of Revenue so if you're a group net
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
metering host or you have a PPA if you
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a PPA you can either bundle the Rex
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
with the energy and sell that to the
 
02:22:21.309 --> 02:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
buying entity some
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
some buyers want those resources to be
 
02:22:27.309 --> 02:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
bundles so Rex are a commodity that is
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
additional and separate from the
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
electricity the kilowatt hours
 
02:22:35.230 --> 02:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
themselves um and then if you're a group
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
net metering host you can sell the Rex
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
on the market um separately the price
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
varies depending on supply and demand um
 
02:22:47.550 --> 02:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
and so we're not guaranteed a certain
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue we are competing
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
against other wreck generating entities
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
for um selling our wrecks to buyers but
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
it is I'd say on average an
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
additional two to three cents a kilowatt
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
hour of Revenue which is very helpful to
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know help in the margins or recover
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
some of these Investments that I
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we have to
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
make followup so the other thing I'm
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
curious about is um the default rate
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned that you're
 
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
getting when when you're net metering um
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that you're splitting that with your
 
02:23:29.070 --> 02:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know your group customers as a group
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
host so I have heard a lot of different
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
things about the value of um of of the
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
net metering so I I wonder if you could
 
02:23:41.309 --> 02:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
speak to that a little bit to educate us
 
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit more on how that works um I
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
guess specifically what I'm trying to
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
figure out is again
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
whether uh the value you mentioned that
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
all that's included is the cost of the
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
power so what else could be your in your
 
02:23:59.950 --> 02:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
opinion should be included there because
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
I think we should understand that yeah
 
02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'll say we are
 
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
um huge fans of the group nit metering
 
02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
program um we are happy with status quo
 
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
we've been very you know there's been a
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
docket at the puc over the last two to
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
three years and G's position has been
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
status quo is working for us we would
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
like to maintain status quo it is very
 
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
important for us to have um stability
 
02:24:32.190 --> 02:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
and so the currently participating
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
projects are grandfathered in the
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
program we would like to see that you
 
02:24:39.790 --> 02:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
know secured um we do feel like there is
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of uncertainty because it feels
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
like it is a constantly reevaluated
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
program both at the Pu and at the
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
legislature um we were about some of the
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
currently participating programs be uh
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
projects being affected by retrospective
 
02:24:59.230 --> 02:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
changes when things are considered at
 
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
the Pu and at the legislature we see it
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
as a win-win because we have stable
 
02:25:08.269 --> 02:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue at least in six-month increments
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
and as I said we group member customers
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
and then give them discounts on their
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill and so for example for an
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
industrial customer they can go out and
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
get the best offer they can from a
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier and then we will
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
give them additional discount for
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
participating in our net metering group
 
02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
so it's helping our business and it's
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
helping their
 
02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
business and I'll I'll just add to that
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman can I just add to
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question um I just
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
want to also point out that with with
 
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
Hydro because they are registered at ISO
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
New England the energy and capacity
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
payments that those hydros would
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise earn are retained by the
 
02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
utility eversource Unitil whatever the
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
utility is and so those are an offset to
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
the credit that the um that the hydro
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
owners are earning as their net metering
 
02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
credit so I just wanted to mention that
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
because that for other um Renewables
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
that may not be registered in ISO that
 
02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
um that offset is not
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
there so because we were Market
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
participants before we parti became
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
group hosts the the way that it's done
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
in in every New England State where we
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
participate in at metering in every New
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
England state that I'm aware of at least
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
um we continue to participate in the
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
wholesale and capacity markets however
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
we don't receive any of that Revenue we
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
transfer it to the host utility so to
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
use really broad generalizations if the
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
default service is 8
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
cents but right now the power's pretty
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
high right and so if we're um we're
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
selling electricity into the wholesale
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
market and getting capacity payments
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to the host utility to
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
offset what they are paying us as a net
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
metering credit so at times they may
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
even get more than they're paying us at
 
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
times they're getting less but if on
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
average over the six months electricity
 
02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
and capacity added up to 6 cents a
 
02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:17.429 align:start position:0%
and capacity added up to 6 cents a
kilowatt

02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
kilowatt
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
hour that offsets the 8 cent per
 
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour that they're paying us and
 
02:27:24.429 --> 02:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
then we're taking some of that and
 
02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
giving it to the
 
02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
members okay now representative Wendy
 
02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you very much um thank you
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
for being here interesting um
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
information that you've given on this
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
flyer right here um on the back it it
 
02:27:43.389 --> 02:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
makes a notation about um that most fa
 
02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
facilities are eligible to be on the
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
national register of historic places um
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
however if a facility or building is put
 
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
on that list it limits modifications and
 
02:27:58.349 --> 02:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
Renovations um which could impact cost
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
and efficiency so is that simply a
 
02:28:03.870 --> 02:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
Charming note or is that your intent to
 
02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
get these facilities on that
 
02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
list I'll say this is Great River
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
hydra's handout so I can't speak to
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
their facilities but we have 100y old
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and we do not voluntarily put
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
them on that list typically during
 
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
relicensing because we have to do a his
 
02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
historic study they'll say this has
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous historical value we want it
 
02:28:27.309 --> 02:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
to be listed and that comes with a lot
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
of requirements so for example at one of
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
our facilities that is gorgeous it looks
 
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
like a castle there's these huge wooden
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
doors and we currently are my operators
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
are begging me to replace it with a
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
garage door because it would be so much
 
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
more practical for their dayto day job
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
but we can't just do that we would have
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
to go to the state historic office
 
02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
and make a case that it is absolutely
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and there's no in replacement
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to do the documentation
 
02:28:59.469 --> 02:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
and all of that so that's an example of
 
02:29:01.469 --> 02:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
some of these Hydro power facilities
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
have tremendous historic value but as a
 
02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operator and someone that's
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do their job in a practical
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
way it would be great sometimes to be
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
able to update that to Modern standards
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
as far as Windows and Doors and things
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
like that but we can't always do that
 
02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:18.630 align:start position:0%
like that but we can't always do that
thank

02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
you represent Ros has a
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um yeah I
 
02:29:28.750 --> 02:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to return to the topic uh of
 
02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:30.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to return to the topic uh of
the

02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
importance uh and the mechanics I guess
 
02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
of the the group net metering for the
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the hydro industry I think it would
 
02:29:40.510 --> 02:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
be really helpful for this all the
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to understand
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
more as best we can uh and to you know
 
02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
more as best we can uh and to you know
to

02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate um the value that's
 
02:29:54.750 --> 02:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
created and I was wondering if I I guess
 
02:29:58.349 --> 02:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
I more of a request to in followup to
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
this presentation if you could share
 
02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh you know with a Precision
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
up to the Precision that you're
 
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable um you know the revenue
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
streams that you know the operators are
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
earning from group net group net
 
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
metering that's how many are selling
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
their p
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
into the grid but also in particular the
 
02:30:26.429 --> 02:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
group net metering and the municipal
 
02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
host you know
 
02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
how those policy instruments that this
 
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
legislature has passed has enacted in
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
the past are now are sharing the
 
02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
the past are now are sharing the
benefits

02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
benefiting local businesses
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities you even mentioned um as
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
SC State agencies are now earning
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue by being part of the
 
02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
group um we would I think that would be
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
super valuable for this committee to to
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
have and you know like I say you've got
 
02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
contracts it's it's finances but if you
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
could figure it out like what level
 
02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're comfortable with sharing
 
02:31:10.750 --> 02:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh so maybe some is
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
aggregated um I think it would just be
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
real helpful for
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
us sure let me just jump in here and say
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
that uh representative rolds
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
may want to get together with you
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
individually and personally to uh learn
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
more about this program and then he can
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
share what he learns with the rest of us
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
yeah how would that be yeah some of the
 
02:31:34.349 --> 02:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
challenges are that it's a contract
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
between the host and the members and so
 
02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
I know what I agree to with my members I
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what other hosts agree to and
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
there is a a bit of a competitiveness
 
02:31:47.710 --> 02:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
there so but we could talk in in
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
generalizations representative schneller
 
02:31:52.349 --> 02:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
has a
 
02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman uh I have
 
02:31:59.269 --> 02:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
127 questions but I I suspect I will not
 
02:32:02.830 --> 02:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
be indulged to that effect um so I I'll
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
I mean this is fascinating thank you
 
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
very much for your time um I total sort
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
of $25 million or so in in current fish
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
pass uh needs for Just Two facilities so
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
I suspect there's substantially more
 
02:32:21.550 --> 02:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
than that um um and I I'll get to my
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
question really again tremendously
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
fascinating I'm just wondering is there
 
02:32:31.150 --> 02:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
a standard capital structure for any one
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
facility or they or are they all sort of
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
custom uh structured then bonded
 
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
together and then is there a bond sorry
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
sorry for the multiple questions is
 
02:32:46.830 --> 02:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
there a standard bond that gets issued
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
to finance Hydro in this state
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh and have there been any defaults on
 
02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
those bonds if that the answer to the
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
first question is yes there isn't a
 
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
standard so unfortunately each you know
 
02:33:03.309 --> 02:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
I have a I have a portfolio of hydro
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
projects I visit a lot of other Hydro
 
02:33:08.429 --> 02:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
projects they're all unique because of
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
they were custom built for that specific
 
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
location in that specific River and so
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
when we're designing fish passages
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's not sort of an off-the-shelf
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
cookie cutter you know fish lift or fish
 
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
ladder that we can put into there that
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
would save a lot of of money if there
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
was but because each site is different
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
um pretty much we have to design an
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
engineer from scratch a specific
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
solution for that specific location um
 
02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
there is more hope in the industry for
 
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
what's called fish friendly turbin so we
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
may be able to replace the actual
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
turbine Hub the propeller like blades to
 
02:33:55.950 --> 02:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
um actually not have to worry about the
 
02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
fish going through the turban and being
 
02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
able to survive there's one company that
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
has something more promising than we've
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
seen so far so that would be very
 
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
helpful um for the downstream passage
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
for the Upstream passage you're still
 
02:34:14.190 --> 02:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to sort of design custom
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
and as far as a bond most of these are
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
private businesses and so you know for
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
example we we are either using our own
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
capital or we would be borrowing from
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
lenders to be able to finance fish
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
passage projects so we're not but we're
 
02:34:31.389 --> 02:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
not at the scale where we would be you
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
know issuing a bond or anything like
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm not aware of any defaults if
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
there are thank you representative
 
02:34:39.309 --> 02:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
Kaplan has a
 
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
you for coming in uh this is a similar
 
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
question but instead of fish passages
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is about spillways and I'm uh
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about extreme weather events
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the likelihood of increased
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
precipitation in in the coming years so
 
02:34:56.670 --> 02:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
because it's a topic of a bill that I'm
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to be presenting later this
 
02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon so um we heard from the the
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
dam Bureau that there's a $900 million
 
02:35:05.309 --> 02:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
cost just to bring the dams up to up to
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
scratch so to speak uh so and you
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that the the the need to
 
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
beef up your spillways is an extremely
 
02:35:15.309 --> 02:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
high uh you know extremely expensive
 
02:35:17.710 --> 02:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
Endeavor so I'm I'm kind of wondering
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
similarly to representative schneller uh
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
what uh funding mechanis what funding
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
mechanisms you have in place or in mind
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
um to to meet those
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
needs it's just us having to pay for it
 
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
as I said it's either Capital that we've
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
set aside or we have to borrow and then
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
pay down that debt
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
um we are overseen mostly by firk at the
 
02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
federal level um and so they have
 
02:35:47.070 --> 02:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
slightly different regulations than the
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
state Dam Bureau but um
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
we really we regularly you know in
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
relicensing or regular Dam safety
 
02:35:56.830 --> 02:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
inspections all dams have a certain
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
Hazard rating so they can be if they're
 
02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
high Hazard they're held to a very high
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
standard they're inspected annually they
 
02:36:06.429 --> 02:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
have to also be inspected every five
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
years by an independent engineer um
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's lots and lots of oversight there
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's you know everything
 
02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
down to low Hazard where it may be in a
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
more you know isolated area if the Dam
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
failed it it's not perceived that there
 
02:36:25.269 --> 02:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
would be loss of life or damage to
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or damage to any
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
properties Downstream so those have a
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
different standards but certainly if a
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
dam is seen to be insufficient to be
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
able to pass a certain level of expected
 
02:36:41.790 --> 02:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
flood flows the improvements that we're
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
talking about usually involve almost
 
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
entirely rebuilding the dam so either
 
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
building much taller walls on the sides
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
expanding a Spillway or adding
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
additional bypass Gates which you know
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
essentially you're rebuilding the whole
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
Dam so we're talking about very
 
02:37:00.359 --> 02:37:01.590 align:start position:0%
Dam so we're talking about very
significant

02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
significant
infrastructure

02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
you for being here uh this is very
 
02:37:19.950 --> 02:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
exciting because there's so much that my
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
system has in common with things that
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
you've been talking about so uh my whole
 
02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
H solar system captures and stores
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
energy from nature and uh now storage uh
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's impractical to impractical to put a
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
hydropower Dam in my garage so I bought
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
a battery and store it that way but uh I
 
02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
use net metering m i get Rec's renewable
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
energy credits
 
02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh my question is this that if
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
I if I don't get those credits it's not
 
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
going to be you know the end of the line
 
02:38:03.309 --> 02:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
for me as far as I would continue doing
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing I wouldn't get some cost
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
offsets but I'm not heavily vested and
 
02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a essential business interest
 
02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
if the Rec's went
 
02:38:18.030 --> 02:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
away how would that impact the ability
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
to continue to be VI
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
from an electric generation standpoint
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
for hydr
 
02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
power um I mean as I said it it's not an
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
insignificant source of Revenue
 
02:38:34.990 --> 02:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
currently um and it it is very helpful
 
02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
to our bottom line it you know it's two
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
to three cents a kilowatt hour is is a a
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
good amount so certainly I I can't speak
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
for all the gsha members but um it is a
 
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
policy that is extremely important to
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
our industry here in New Hampshire um
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
and if you have bills on group net
 
02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
metering or the RPS you will likely see
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
us to tell you the importance of this
 
02:39:04.349 --> 02:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
policy for for our industry so it it may
 
02:39:06.510 --> 02:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
be maker break for for certain
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
facilities that are on the margins as I
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
said especially some of the really you
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
know gsha includes some of the really
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
small hydros like they may be 250
 
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
KW that's pretty small but they still
 
02:39:22.349 --> 02:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
have to maintain a dam and they still
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
have to um fall under all of these
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and Licensing requirements so
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
they they probably really need um that
 
02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
extra revenue from the Rex thank you
 
02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
right the economies of scale definitely
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
are a factor um and I was around when we
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
were negotiating and working on the RPS
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
and and putting it on the books um
 
02:39:48.590 --> 02:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
and partly why class 4 which is H
 
02:39:50.429 --> 02:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
existing Hydro
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of reasons why 5
 
02:39:53.950 --> 02:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
megawatts is kind of a magic number if
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
you will but one of the um pieces of
 
02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
thinking was that um uh making sure that
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy certificates um
 
02:40:06.429 --> 02:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
would really be helping these uh smaller
 
02:40:08.269 --> 02:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
ones that really don't have necessarily
 
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
the economies of scale that some um some
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
other larger facilities
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
do I will say we generally as a business
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
try to manage our business risk so if
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's at all possible to cross qualify
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
one of our projects in multiple States
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
we do do that because there's
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in policy in every state and
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
so we try to to manage our business Risk
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
by cross qualifying in multiple States
 
02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
so that if one State's RPS goes away we
 
02:40:42.429 --> 02:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully can continue to participate in
 
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
RPS well I want to thank you both for
 
02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
being here I know we have a longstanding
 
02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:49.830 align:start position:0%
being here I know we have a longstanding
invitation

02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
invitation
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
from Granite State hydr power to visit a
 
02:40:55.349 --> 02:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
hydr power facility and we will take you
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
up on that offer this spring once the uh
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
hectic uh legislative battles are behind
 
02:41:05.950 --> 02:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
us and we have a little more time we
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
will arrange a committee visit to one of
 
02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
your facilities we'll look forward to
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
that and we'll have a lot of time to
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
talk to you and others uh about the
 
02:41:20.030 --> 02:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
operation of your facilities so that we
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
can augment our knowledge uh even
 
02:41:24.349 --> 02:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
greater than than what we've learned
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
here today so thank you again and uh if
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
any members have any further questions
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
see these ladies uh after we end our
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
session here thank before we go to lunch
 
02:41:36.429 --> 02:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
I want to bring you up to date on a
 
02:41:38.269 --> 02:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
couple of things I learned at a meeting
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
earlier this
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
morning for those of you who are
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
new excuse me the speaker holds weekly
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
meetings with chairs and Vice chairs of
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
committees to discuss various issues and
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk is always at those meetings
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
and he answers questions and this
 
02:42:00.309 --> 02:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
morning I learned the following we
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
discussed this yesterday and had some
 
02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
questions if you are the prime sponsor
 
02:42:10.269 --> 02:42:10.279 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of a bill you can
 
02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to a committee public
 
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
hearing you must bring sufficient
 
02:42:20.190 --> 02:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
quantities of that Amendment text to
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
distribute to all members of the
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
committee if you are not the prime
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of a bill the only way you can
 
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
suggest Amendment language in your
 
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing testimony is via your
 
02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:36.269 align:start position:0%
public hearing testimony is via your
written

02:42:36.269 --> 02:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
testimony so that is the important
 
02:42:42.190 --> 02:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
distinction Prime sponsors can enter
 
02:42:43.389 --> 02:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
offer an
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
amendment non-prime sponsors have to put
 
02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment suggested Amendment text in
 
02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
their written
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
testimony representative reels in
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
elucidation there
 
02:43:00.030 --> 02:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
instance that suggested amendment in the
 
02:43:07.150 --> 02:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
text of testimony would require
 
02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
essentially another proceeding later to
 
02:43:12.269 --> 02:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
be translated into an actual amendment
 
02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
that could be considered by the
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee exactly remember the committee
 
02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
owns the the bill and it's up to the
 
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee to decide if they want to
 
02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
amend the bill or not so others can
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
suggest amendments but only the
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee can actually make an amendment
 
02:43:33.429 --> 02:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
or offer an
 
02:43:35.550 --> 02:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
amendment the other thing I learned this
 
02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
morning is that the rule change that we
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
made on Wednesday last
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
week does allow the calling of an
 
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
executive session at any time at the
 
02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh discretion of the
 
02:43:54.510 --> 02:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
chair but it has to be noticed in the
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
calendar first so if a public hearing
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
calls for let's say five public hearings
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the course of a day and then
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
underneath that there is language that
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
says executive sessions may be called at
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
any time then that means that the chair
 
02:44:16.349 --> 02:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
could call an executive session at any
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
time and the reason for that change is
 
02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
let's say you scheduled a public hearing
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
for 2 hours because you thought a lot of
 
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
people were going to come and
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
testify and then the the hearing opens
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
the sponsor introduces the bill and
 
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
nobody signed up to testify and the
 
02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
hearing's over in 20 minutes now you've
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
got almost two hours of time to kill
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
before your next public hearing so if
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
you had
 
02:44:49.309 --> 02:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
bills that you had already heard heard
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
in public hearing the chair could call
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
an executive committee to make valuable
 
02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
use of your time here in the state house
 
02:45:01.950 --> 02:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
to dispose of those those bills so
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's the the rationale behind
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
using the ability to call an executive
 
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
session at any time as long as it's
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
noticed ahead of
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
time so I wanted to bring you guys up to
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
date on on that representative Kaplan
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah just just a further clarification
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
on that last Point Mr chair I mean uh
 
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
does that ability extend beyond the you
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
know sort of unofficial closing time at
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
five o'clock say could you keep us here
 
02:45:32.429 --> 02:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
after everything's done and say we're
 
02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
going to have an executive session only
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
if I obtained permission from the
 
02:45:39.309 --> 02:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
speaker because that requires staff to
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
be kept Beyond 5:00 which puts them on
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
overtime and the speaker has to approve
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
overtime uh so it the answer is yes it
 
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
can be done but not
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
easily and not not if the speaker says
 
02:45:59.469 --> 02:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
no okay we're off to lunch everybody
 
02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
back here at 1:00 to hear from ISO New
 
02:46:04.269 --> 02:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
England that'll be an exciting
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%

04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back to the afternoon
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
session of science technology and
 
04:02:28.750 --> 04:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
energy on uh Tuesday the 14th of January
 
04:02:31.309 --> 04:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
we have two presentations this afternoon
 
04:02:34.030 --> 04:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
the first one will be in just a moment
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
by ISO New England and then after their
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
presentation and Q&amp;A we will move to a
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
presentation by The Joint util i ities
 
04:02:47.070 --> 04:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
eversource unit till Liberty and New
 
04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
Co-op that has a hard stop time of 3:30
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
because at 3:30 we're going to have a
 
04:02:59.189 --> 04:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
106 so with that introduction Davis if
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
you could turn on the screen over here
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
for us please we're set to go with a
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
presentation from ISO new New England so
 
04:03:13.950 --> 04:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
gentlemen welcome the floor is yours
 
04:03:13.960 --> 04:03:15.710 align:start position:0%
gentlemen welcome the floor is yours
very

04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
much press it press the
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
button good good afternoon my name is
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
Eric Johnson I'm the executive director
 
04:03:26.429 --> 04:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
of external Affairs for ISO New England
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
and with me is uh Nathan rake who's a
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
member of the external Affairs team and
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
a liaison to the folks here in New
 
04:03:35.070 --> 04:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thanks for the invite uh we're
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
going to share a presentation that is a
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
bit of a uh information resource packet
 
04:03:43.510 --> 04:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
we won't go through this in detail and
 
04:03:45.630 --> 04:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
we happy to take questions along the way
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
and as time permits uh at the
 
04:03:52.750 --> 04:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
end so if we start thinking about the
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
mission and vision of our organization
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
our mission describes what we do and our
 
04:04:03.309 --> 04:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
mission is defined in uh rules that have
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
been approved by the Federal Energy
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission or firk so I'll
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
try to spell out acronyms raise your
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
hand if I say something that you don't
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
recognize and our mission uh dates back
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
to the um the beginning of the iso in
 
04:04:20.429 --> 04:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
the late 1990s and we are responsible
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
for planning the transmission system
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
administering wholesale
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
markets and operating the bulk power
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
system uh in real
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
time aspirationally we've adopted a
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
vision statement that we think aligns
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
with the direction of the New England
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
states and recognizes that there's a lot
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
of new technologies that are coming
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
online uh the vision state is adopted by
 
04:04:48.269 --> 04:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
the iso did not require approval by firk
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
and just gives you two dimensions of the
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
scope of our work and what we do and I'm
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to Nathan to talk
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit about more on the
 
04:04:56.520 --> 04:04:57.790 align:start position:0%
a little bit about more on the
organizational

04:04:57.790 --> 04:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
organizational
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
side so the iso has more than two
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
decades of experience ad ministering and
 
04:05:05.149 --> 04:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
the Region's restructured Electric
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
System as Eric mentioned we are
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Federal Energy
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission or furk we also
 
04:05:13.149 --> 04:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
serve as the reliability coordinator for
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
New England under the North American
 
04:05:19.469 --> 04:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
reliability Corporation or nerk and O as
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
an entity the iso is independent of all
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
the companies that participate in the
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
can I just interrupt real quick Nathan
 
04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
really quick for the benefit of our new
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
people here uh they may not know what
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
ISO means oh independent system
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
operator thank
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
you so the i in the iso is for
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
independent which means we are
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
independent of all company that are
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
participate in the marketplace and
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
neutral on technology that comes into
 
04:05:49.040 --> 04:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
neutral on technology that comes into
the

04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
market we have three critical roles that
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
were facilitated facilitated To Us by
 
04:05:59.229 --> 04:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
firk this includes grid operation Market
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:07.670 --> 04:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
planning there are five key areas that
 
04:06:10.030 --> 04:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
we do not touch on we do not handle
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
retail electricity own any of the grid
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure have stake in companies
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
that own grid infrastructure have
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over fuel or have any
 
04:06:24.030 --> 04:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.469 --> 04:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
sighting there are numerous entities
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
that uh provide oversight and oversight
 
04:06:32.590 --> 04:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
and input into the iso predominantly we
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
focus on the New England states through
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
our work with the Committees but also
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
through the consumer Advocates Attorneys
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
General policy makers such as yourselves
 
04:06:44.149 --> 04:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh the puc's doe Dees from on occasion
 
04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:50.590 align:start position:0%
uh the puc's doe Dees from on occasion
as

04:06:50.590 --> 04:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.309 --> 04:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
well you can think of the iso as part of
 
04:06:56.910 --> 04:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
a wider Regional organ uh body that is
 
04:06:58.990 --> 04:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
known as the Eastern interconnection we
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
are tied directly to Quebec through DC
 
04:07:04.590 --> 04:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
transmission ties and this stems out of
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory adjustments made after the
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
2003 blackout in the Greater Cleveland
 
04:07:09.920 --> 04:07:15.030 align:start position:0%
2003 blackout in the Greater Cleveland
area

04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize that about 133% of
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
the Region's energy needs are met by
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
imports from uh Quebec and this is
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
through our thae lines our DC Tha lines
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
but also through imports from New York
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:35.109 --> 04:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
lines currently the New England system
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
is a summer peaking system however as we
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
transition through electrification we
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate this becoming more of a
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.670 --> 04:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
system this provides a quick snapshot of
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
what the of the resource mix today we
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
are a predominantly a natural gas
 
04:08:00.189 --> 04:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
operated uh system but we have seen a
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
growth of Renewables at over the last
 
04:08:02.560 --> 04:08:03.750 align:start position:0%
growth of Renewables at over the last
several

04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
years which is more emphasized by this
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
by this chart so we used to have a
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
system that was had an increased mix of
 
04:08:15.550 --> 04:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
coal and oil but that has been
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
supplanted by natural gas to the point
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
where coal and oil no longer provide a a
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
resource and then generally overall
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
markets have the price electricity has
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
been coming down as markets have been
 
04:08:35.309 --> 04:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
driving the the facilitation of cost
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
competitive electricity to the
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
region with that I'll turn it back over
 
04:08:39.680 --> 04:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
region with that I'll turn it back over
to

04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
Eric if we think about the resource mix
 
04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh solar has been a pretty fast growing
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
resource uh in New England but for the
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
most part the iso doesn't see solar if
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
you have solar facilities on the rooftop
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
of a house or even a small array for the
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
iso and the control room operators it
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
really looks like a reduction in demand
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
on the bulk power system because now the
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
customers's power supply is coming from
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
an attached resource if it's if it's
 
04:09:13.630 --> 04:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
solar we are starting to see larger grid
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
scale solar facilities uh most of them
 
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
are in uh the region in Maine um but
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
this slide gives you an indication of
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
the the number of
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
installations there's more than 300,000
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh across the region and we have about
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
6,500 megawatts of uh capacity that
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
could be produced by uh those solar
 
04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
facilities so that's today if you think
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
back to the 2010 time frame uh there was
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
almost no solar operating on the system
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
our operators wouldn't see any change in
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
the load because of solar but it's grown
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
pretty rapidly and most of this growth
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
we attribute to the incentives that have
 
04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
been provided by uh the New England
 
04:10:00.030 --> 04:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
states and Mr chair I'll defer to you on
 
04:10:03.309 --> 04:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative Ros thank you
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just a clarifying question here
 
04:10:09.630 --> 04:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
numbers behind the meter solar or uh
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
larger scale solar that is
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
supplying the grid directly when you
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
show these numbers so this forecast
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
includes both and so the the the fine
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
print at the bottom will specify that
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.920 --> 04:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
out

04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Kaplan thank yeah I
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
have I have a question about what you
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
just mentioned which is the the
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
distributed solar that you don't see uh
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
on the iso does that uh because it does
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
lower Demand on the on the iso system
 
04:10:49.710 --> 04:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
does that you know distributed solar
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
resource and you know it's penetration
 
04:10:53.349 --> 04:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
into the grid does that represent a
 
04:10:55.149 --> 04:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
value that gets translated into the
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
market at all why don't we go to the
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
next slide and we'll give you sort of a
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
illustration of what solar looks like on
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
the bulk power system so the line here
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
is a single day in New England it
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
happens to be a a spring day and the
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
leftand side is midnight and it goes for
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
24 hours and historically the iso would
 
04:11:20.910 --> 04:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
turn on resources to meet the demand for
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
power which was the top line which
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
includes the dash line and so you could
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
see that the peak in New England
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
typically was in the early afternoon as
 
04:11:33.389 --> 04:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
you've added a lot of solar it reduces
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
that demand uh on the system and so most
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
of those resources are not in the market
 
04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
we will see newer large scale resources
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
that could participate in the market
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
Market but an individual customer um on
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
the solar side is more likely
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
participating in some type of a net
 
04:11:53.389 --> 04:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
metering program that is regulated and
 
04:11:57.109 --> 04:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
level representative rols thank you Mr
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
chair so that's a a huge uh Delta there
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
reduced Demand on the grid from all the
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
since majority of Generation Um on the
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
grid and especially the majority of uh
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
dispatchable generation on the grid are
 
04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
the natural gas plants is it possible to
 
04:12:29.840 --> 04:12:30.630 align:start position:0%
the natural gas plants is it possible to
think

04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
of that big yellow area every day as
 
04:12:38.109 --> 04:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
reduced uh consumption reduced demand
 
04:12:40.750 --> 04:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
for natural
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
gas yes in effect because the gas
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
resources typically are the marginal
 
04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
resources on the system and we would
 
04:12:53.229 --> 04:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
dispatch them down if we don't need them
 
04:12:55.710 --> 04:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
and as the solar penetration grows we
 
04:12:58.590 --> 04:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
need less gas at that point and so it
 
04:13:01.070 --> 04:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
does directly impact gas quick followup
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair followup yes and so
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
um does that reduced demand for natural
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
gas by the by the fleet of power plants
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
throughout New England does that
 
04:13:14.399 --> 04:13:16.309 align:start position:0%
throughout New England does that
translate

04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
translate
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
into value for all rate
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
payers uh and value for consumers of
 
04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas I mean that much reduction
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
in demand for natural gas if you think
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
about the uh the wintertime scenario
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
when the natural gas infrastructure is
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
constrained we can't serve all the power
 
04:13:40.269 --> 04:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
generation that uses gas and the local
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
Distribution Company uh demand for
 
04:13:46.830 --> 04:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
natural gas so in the winter time as uh
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
solar is operating at least when it's on
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
a sunny day it is freeing up in effect
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh natural gas on the system that would
 
04:13:57.630 --> 04:13:57.640 align:start position:0%
go to uh other resources but it wasn't
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
designed particularly to reduce the
 
04:14:03.070 --> 04:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas use in the region but it's
 
04:14:05.790 --> 04:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
effect Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
this chart obviously is for a uh a nice
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh full Sunny spring day when the
 
04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
temperatures are very temperate um uh so
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
my question would be is that do you have
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
a graph that
 
04:14:27.149 --> 04:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
shows overall the average through an
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
entire year what this graph might might
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
look like well it wouldn't look like a
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
load profile for 24 hours but we do have
 
04:14:38.670 --> 04:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
that data and I'm happy to follow up uh
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
with a committee to share that it' be
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative parall you chair v a
 
04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
quick question and thank you for being
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
here um I'm looking at what I always
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
believed was a traditional peak time of
 
04:14:57.550 --> 04:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
around 4:30 and I'm seeing on this chart
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
it actually uh there's a dip there in
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
your estimated demand without BTM well
 
04:15:03.520 --> 04:15:04.510 align:start position:0%
your estimated demand without BTM well
estimated

04:15:04.510 --> 04:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
04:15:08.590 --> 04:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
demand um on April 9th was there not
 
04:15:10.990 --> 04:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
that typical what what I always thought
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
was a typical peak time between four and
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
six approximately yeah that's changed
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
completely as you add all of this solar
 
04:15:24.510 --> 04:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
onto the system so if you go back uh a
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
decade pre- solar the system would have
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
peaked in the
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon and here at uh 4:30 we're
 
04:15:35.070 --> 04:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
actually using
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
less uh Power on the bulk power system
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
than we are in the middle of the
 
04:15:43.149 --> 04:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
night because the solar is displacing
 
04:15:44.670 --> 04:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
all of that energy but then of course it
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
comes back on quickly this shows a
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
pretty steep ramp in the afternoon you
 
04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
need to have resources that have the
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility to chase that demand as it
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
comes back as the solar is going
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
offline well
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
um followup thank you so much for the
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
followup um I just want to make sure I'm
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
getting the chart right though I can see
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
that the the effect that solar is having
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
but um your estimated demand without
 
04:16:15.469 --> 04:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
solar BT M solar uh the dotted line as
 
04:16:19.389 --> 04:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
it were um that dotted line is a
 
04:16:23.070 --> 04:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
prediction of when our uh also where our
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
Peak would be right if we didn't let's
 
04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
say it's today's a cloudy day right so
 
04:16:29.309 --> 04:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get the same output
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
so this this load profile would look
 
04:16:35.149 --> 04:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
more like the typical load profile on a
 
04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
day when you don't have solar production
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
so it look more like the dashed
 
04:16:43.630 --> 04:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
line okay thank you yes
 
04:16:43.640 --> 04:16:44.830 align:start position:0%
line okay thank you yes
thank

04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
you so can you speak uh briefly
 
04:16:52.189 --> 04:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
about the effect on the bulk power
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
system particularly the gas
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
operators of ramping down their
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
production and then ramping it back up
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
steeply in the afternoon what do that
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of cost impact does that have
 
04:17:08.349 --> 04:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
system So currently the gas Fleet is a
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
very um
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
efficient Fleet they're very flexible
 
04:17:18.750 --> 04:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
and they have that ability uh to ramp uh
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
they can go down uh on clear dispatch
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
instructions from the iso and they can
 
04:17:25.710 --> 04:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
ramp back up um they're not the fastest
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
resources the pump storage Hydro
 
04:17:30.149 --> 04:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
resources are um are much faster in
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
terms of their responding and then
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
batteries of course could discharge in
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
um to the grid instantly um but what
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's effectively doing is it's telling
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
the marginal resource which tends to be
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
gas right now we're going to take less
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
power from you in the times when you
 
04:17:50.189 --> 04:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
have Sun but we're going to need you at
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the day when the Sun goes
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
down and people aren't changing their
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
use of electricity just because they put
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
solar on the system so we still have to
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
figure out where the power is going to
 
04:18:06.670 --> 04:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
come from if the solar is not operating
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned at the beginning solar is
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
not a a resource that's putting power
 
04:18:14.590 --> 04:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
onto the grid but we have to forecast
 
04:18:18.309 --> 04:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
each day and we do this on a uh an
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
hourly basis as well trying to figure
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
out knowing how much solar is out there
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
what could it produce in terms of
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
electricity and then we have to take
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
that into account in our operating plan
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
so the control room and the forecasters
 
04:18:33.790 --> 04:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
are looking at is it going to be cloudy
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
today um what what time does the Sun
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
come up what time to the sunset uh we
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
used to think about the weather a lot in
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
terms of temperature but now we're
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot more in terms of the the
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
system uh this is a snapshot of one of
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities Nathan talked about
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh planning the power system so we are
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
responsible as the grid operator to
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
study every proposal for new resources
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
that want to connect to the grid again
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
the bulk power system system uh we call
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
that the generator interconnection uh
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
study process and we use the term Q
 
04:19:21.070 --> 04:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
which is like the British term for you
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
get in line so this is a snapshot of
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
everything that has come to us for
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
application to connect to the grid and
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side of this doughnut
 
04:19:33.710 --> 04:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
chart you can see wind is about a little
 
04:19:33.720 --> 04:19:34.429 align:start position:0%
chart you can see wind is about a little
over

04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:19:38.109 --> 04:19:38.119 align:start position:0%
40% battery storage is almost uh half of
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
what's in the queue we're starting to
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
see grid scale solar here show up uh at
 
04:19:42.880 --> 04:19:43.790 align:start position:0%
see grid scale solar here show up uh at
about

04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:19:46.269 --> 04:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
8% the most noticeable difference here
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
and it's not on this slide is if you
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
looked at this chart back in 2017 gas
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
was the dominant resource and now gas
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
hardle shows up so um over time we've
 
04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
seen the Q change as the states in uh
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
New England particularly the southern
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
New England states have provide uh
 
04:20:06.790 --> 04:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
strong incentives for uh procurement of
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
offshore wind uh in particular so what's
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
in the queue is is really driven by uh
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
State policy for the most part in the
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
region now when I'll make one more point
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
on the Queue I'm happy to take a
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
question on it uh the iso doesn't uh
 
04:20:23.790 --> 04:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
decide that this is what the resource
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
mix should be we're simply looking at
 
04:20:28.750 --> 04:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
the interconnection of a project to the
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
grid and making sure that it wouldn't
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
have an adverse impact on the system or
 
04:20:35.309 --> 04:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
anybody else connected to the system um
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
and we also don't look at the permeating
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
inciting it's really just an engineering
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
assessment on the system and the
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
developer needs to find financing they
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
need to secure their approvals um we're
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
just making sure that it's not going to
 
04:20:49.229 --> 04:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
adversely impact uh the rest of the grid
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a snapshot of the queue
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's public information and on the right
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
hand side you can see the Breakout by by
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
state representative Swanson has a
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair just to
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
clarify um so these are proposals
 
04:21:06.670 --> 04:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
clearly don't
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
reflect the way things are right now but
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
this is part of some vision is their uh
 
04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
time Horizon associated with these
 
04:21:20.349 --> 04:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
proposals so uh each project uh comes
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
into the queue and we do a series of uh
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
meetings with a developer and they need
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
to make a financial commitment for us to
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
do the study work um and depending on
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
which uh studies they choose to do
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
there's um sort of an an initial kick
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
the tires study we'll give them a an
 
04:21:43.389 --> 04:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
indication of what would be required to
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
connect to the system but there are much
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
more detailed uh engineering studies uh
 
04:21:50.189 --> 04:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
called system impact studies and those
 
04:21:52.910 --> 04:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
studies can take um a couple of years to
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
complete so the developer would have to
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
go through the complete study process
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
get a sign off from the iso and the
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
interconnecting utility for that project
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
to go forward um we report to our
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
regulator firk regularly on the um the
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
turnover time for projects in the queue
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to share that with the
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
followup question Mr chair followup so
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
this so This the pie chart here
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
represents the sum of the proposals
 
04:22:25.109 --> 04:22:25.119 align:start position:0%
right now that's correct thank
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Corman you had a
 
04:22:30.990 --> 04:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
question no okay representative Vice
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas thank you Mr chair so I I
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
recall in previous briefings in the past
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
that uh you or someone would have
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
already would have also provided an a
 
04:22:42.000 --> 04:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
already would have also provided an a
slide

04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:22:43.870 --> 04:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
show information that was kind of sort
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
of on this slide but also would show uh
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
during the tame the same time period the
 
04:22:56.189 --> 04:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh base loads we have and what the the
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
mega wattage for base loads might be in
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
the future just to see uh where the
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
balance was I don't see that here is
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
that another slide that you might want
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
to provide to us to show what what might
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
be there we don't have that in that deck
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to put that on as a
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
followup to share with the committee
 
04:23:15.309 --> 04:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
right thank you that looks at the the
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
makeup of existing resources on Sy and
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
and and what it projects to be during
 
04:23:23.070 --> 04:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
the same timeline to to see where you
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
know you know where we're headed because
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
I would assume that you might be
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerned if uh if there aren't many
 
04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
projects being listed um that might
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
affect Basel load and if you only have
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
these being listed uh I'm not sure if
 
04:23:38.830 --> 04:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
there is a concern for the future of the
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
balance of the of of the grid okay
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
represent happy to look for some
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
additional information representative
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
McGee has a question thank you Mr
 
04:23:48.269 --> 04:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you both for being
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
here today um so the thing that strikes
 
04:23:54.429 --> 04:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
me about the chart is the the proposed
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
battery storage at 48% or close to
 
04:24:00.990 --> 04:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
18,000 megawatts which the question
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
really is if that much battery storage
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
came online in New England to be used in
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
terms of managing Peak and all that
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
would that be a game Cher in terms of
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
your job of um being able to manage
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
those peak times it it seems like that's
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of battery it it is and it
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
it kind of Grew From nothing to it was
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
then part of the miscellaneous category
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
and now it's by far the largest of
 
04:24:30.750 --> 04:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
what's in there most of this is uh short
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
duration uh energy energy storage uh
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
lithium ion technology so you're talking
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
about a resource that can hold a charge
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
and discharge but over maybe two to four
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
hours so it it'll help in a small window
 
04:24:46.590 --> 04:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a game Cher in
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
terms of meeting the long duration
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
energy storage needs that we see
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
especially in the winter so um I think
 
04:24:56.590 --> 04:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the direction of having
 
04:24:59.070 --> 04:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
additional storage capability on the
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
system um but what's what's proposed
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
here is also speculative we're not
 
04:25:08.550 --> 04:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
expecting 18,000 megawatts of batteries
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
or wind or solar to come online uh and
 
04:25:11.880 --> 04:25:13.229 align:start position:0%
or wind or solar to come online uh and
and

04:25:13.229 --> 04:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
inevitably uh some developers may have
 
04:25:17.790 --> 04:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
multiple projects that are in this and
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't capture some significant
 
04:25:23.070 --> 04:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
changes that FK has made that's going to
 
04:25:24.990 --> 04:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
put additional requirements on projects
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
before they can get into the queue so
 
04:25:28.910 --> 04:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to set the bar higher the
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of admission to the queue is
 
04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
going to be uh higher and so I think
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a ShakeOut of how
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
many projects are really serious
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
although I expect that the makeup will
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
still be uh wind battery storage and
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
solar for the most part but that that
 
04:25:47.630 --> 04:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
hasn't affected this queue
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
yet representative Matson has a question
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm just wondering
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
where reliability fits into this um this
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
is all renewable battery backup two
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
hours so if we need just in time energy
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
where does it come
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
from so right now that's coming from the
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
fleet of existing resources so this is
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
not a picture of the future this is
 
04:26:15.030 --> 04:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
layering on existing resources that we
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
have today Nathan showed that um about
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
half of our electricity comes from
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
natural gas fire generation so we're
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
assuming that those resources continue
 
04:26:27.630 --> 04:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
we also have uh two large nuclear plants
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
including one here in New Hampshire so
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
those are part of providing uh
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
continuous power supply to the region we
 
04:26:36.189 --> 04:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
have Imports that we can bring in from
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and we have pump storage
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hydra so there's a lot of resources that
 
04:26:42.510 --> 04:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
provide reliability services in addition
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
to what you see here representative
 
04:26:47.710 --> 04:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a question I'm following up
 
04:26:51.109 --> 04:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
on the same theme I I you know we've got
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
the base load that you talked about uh
 
04:26:55.710 --> 04:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
from gas and or
 
04:26:58.229 --> 04:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
nuclear those will age out there's
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
nothing here in this chart indicating uh
 
04:27:05.710 --> 04:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
replacement of those as they get old uh
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
if if this is the future this to me says
 
04:27:12.910 --> 04:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're headed for blackouts yeah yeah so
 
04:27:15.630 --> 04:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
this is not the future by itself this is
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
the future of what developers have
 
04:27:20.670 --> 04:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
proposed uh we expect the nuclear plants
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
could run for many years they're in for
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
relicensing um the natural gas Fleet is
 
04:27:30.510 --> 04:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
a very modern Fleet very efficient we
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
expect that they can operate for many
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
years into the future so the question
 
04:27:36.750 --> 04:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
might be well when are we going to see
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
other types of resources come in uh to
 
04:27:41.469 --> 04:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
this queue it's possible that somebody
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
could propose
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh small uh nuclear reactors um the
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
modular resource they're not probably um
 
04:27:52.030 --> 04:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
economic to do in New England but that
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
is a type of resource that we could see
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
show up in this resource mix uh sometime
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
in the future there's a lot more
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
activity on that um in Canada than we're
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
seeing here in New England but it does
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
have potential to add um other types of
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
capability to the Future resource
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
mix representative
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:28:16.750 --> 04:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had a discussion we met
 
04:28:20.109 --> 04:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy here in
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and they
 
04:28:25.149 --> 04:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
explained to us that while New Hampshire
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
um consumes 10% of the load of
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
electricity that we produce 177% of the
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
electricity now looking at the chart and
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that ISO New England is part of
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
a conglomerate of Six States us and fisc
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
speaking uh known as be like the purple
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
island in the middle of a big blue donut
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
um looking at fiscally knowing that uh
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
um I want to understand being a part of
 
04:28:56.750 --> 04:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
iso New England how is the state of New
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now I understand we had the
 
04:29:00.910 --> 04:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
lowest rates of all the other Six States
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
but how are we affected by the policies
 
04:29:06.590 --> 04:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
procedures of the other five states
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:12.550 --> 04:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
conglomeration if you think about
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
what's proposed here for wind as one
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
example um New Hampshire has not signed
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
up to do procurements of offshore wind
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's been pretty clear that that's not
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
their priority but the other states have
 
04:29:28.590 --> 04:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
and they've chosen to make a commitment
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
to develop projects and they've
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
committed their rate pairs so
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has done that Rhode Island
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
has done that and Massachusetts has done
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
that they're buying wind power they're
 
04:29:41.790 --> 04:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
paying for the projects to be developed
 
04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
and they're buying the output of those
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
plants uh into the future so that choice
 
04:29:50.269 --> 04:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
does not affect uh New Hampshire rirs
 
04:29:52.269 --> 04:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
directly because they're not committing
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
you for the purchase of those uh
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
resources so that's you know one example
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
now if the other New England states are
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
making Investments it will shift the
 
04:30:08.590 --> 04:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
resource mix and over time we could see
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
displacement of uh older fossil fuel
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
plants uh we we've seen retirement of
 
04:30:16.670 --> 04:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
most of the coal the one remaining coal
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
is here in New Hampshire and they've
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
announced plans to retire so we know
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the retirement of that part of the
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
fleet is
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
inevitable um but we do expect the gas
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
Fleet is going to run uh for a very long
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
time in the system and so maybe that
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
Fleet shifts from providing more uh base
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
load to more ramping Services um you
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
know that that could be an effect of
 
04:30:42.510 --> 04:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the system uh but as
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
um representative mentioned as you
 
04:30:49.109 --> 04:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
displace natural gas
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
for uh the grid with solar it does free
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
up gas for other purposes so I mean
 
04:30:57.550 --> 04:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
every state has the potential to impact
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
what's happening uh with the resource
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
mix and the bulk power system but I I
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
would say for the most part the other
 
04:31:06.269 --> 04:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
New England states Massachusetts
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island are are
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
committing their own Rays based on the
 
04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
procurements that that they're doing uh
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
for the resources that we're seeing in
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
this list I used wind as an example
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing the same thing with
 
04:31:18.960 --> 04:31:20.790 align:start position:0%
they're doing the same thing with
battery

04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
battery
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
storage representative reos has a
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um yeah just
 
04:31:29.229 --> 04:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
so again so clarifying question on on
 
04:31:29.239 --> 04:31:30.189 align:start position:0%
so again so clarifying question on on
this

04:31:30.189 --> 04:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
Slide the interconnection queue just as
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
your earlier slide was headed markets
 
04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
select the most cost eff efficient
 
04:31:43.030 --> 04:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
resources to meet current and and future
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
electricity demands it says this is a
 
04:31:49.870 --> 04:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what Market actors private
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
Capital are bringing
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
forward to build new generation in the
 
04:31:57.870 --> 04:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
region right and certainly markets
 
04:32:01.229 --> 04:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
shaped by policy as you said State
 
04:32:03.189 --> 04:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
policies but the these are this is not
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
any but it's not your plan it's not
 
04:32:08.349 --> 04:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
you're not soliciting this stuff this is
 
04:32:10.750 --> 04:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
just what the market is bringing forward
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and when I when we talk about the
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
market we're talking about actors which
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
could be private companies investing or
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
it could be the states directing their
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
utilities to enter into agreements to
 
04:32:27.550 --> 04:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
develop resources so yeah but the Q has
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
always been influenced by you know
 
04:32:34.309 --> 04:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
policy to some extent for many years it
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
it was rational for uh developers to
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
want to build natural gas fire
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
generation because it was more efficient
 
04:32:44.830 --> 04:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
um it was cleaner than the resources
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
that are operating before them coal and
 
04:32:53.469 --> 04:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
you all
 
04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
right so we just talked about the cue of
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
resources that we're looking at on the
 
04:33:04.670 --> 04:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
supply side we also look at proposals to
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
connect to the system where the resource
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
itself might be outside of New England
 
04:33:10.629 --> 04:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
and so developer would build
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
transmission uh from a neighboring area
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
into New England and all of those go
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
through the same uh study as well we
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't look at it from the perspective of
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
would this project have a benefit to New
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
England do we like where it's
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
interconnecting it's really just looking
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
at the reliability of it so uh currently
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
the New England clean energy connect
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
project would bring power from uh Quebec
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh down into Maine and that was largely
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh developed with support from uh
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so again the iso is not
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
planning this but we're looking at the
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
reliability of the system as these
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
projects TI to try to interconnect and
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
so there's there's always been multiples
 
04:33:52.029 --> 04:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
of those transmission projects uh under
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
study it all really all comes down to
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
can the developer get financing and
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
citing and permitting approval and it's
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy task to develop any
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
kind of energy infrastructure in New
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
England we could have a whole
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
conversation about that but whether
 
04:34:08.830 --> 04:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about transmission for
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
reliability transmission for Renewables
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
generation that's renewable all of these
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
projects face uh lots of challenges and
 
04:34:17.359 --> 04:34:19.709 align:start position:0%
projects face uh lots of challenges and
coming

04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
online so speaking of transmission one
 
04:34:25.629 --> 04:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
of our responsibilities is to look 5 to
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
10 years into the future make sure that
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
the transmission system can serve what
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
we forecast to be the demand for power
 
04:34:34.830 --> 04:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
so there's 15 million of us here in New
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
England uh we make choices every day
 
04:34:39.789 --> 04:34:39.799 align:start position:0%
about our energy use and so our job is
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
to forecast well what's that going to
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
look like
 
04:34:44.349 --> 04:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
in the future so we do uh an annual
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
forecast we take all the latest economic
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
data we look at the policies from the
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
states we look at the weather and we
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
look out to say what we would use for
 
04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
electricity uh this year next year and
 
04:34:59.189 --> 04:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
every year for for 10 years uh that
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
drives a lot of the transmission
 
04:35:04.269 --> 04:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
planning so for a number of years we saw
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
a growth in Peak demand of one to 2% so
 
04:35:08.830 --> 04:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
we had to plan transmission to keep up
 
04:35:11.310 --> 04:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
with that uh for about a decade we've
 
04:35:11.320 --> 04:35:12.189 align:start position:0%
with that uh for about a decade we've
seen

04:35:12.189 --> 04:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
investments in Energy Efficiency and
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
that slowed the growth in electricity
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
demand and we haven't seen as much
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
transmission needed for liability uh as
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
we'll get to in a moment we're now
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
seeing a big shift where the states have
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
said they want to drive the future
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
transmission needs to meet public policy
 
04:35:32.670 --> 04:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
and and we'll talk about that in a
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
moment so the transmission planning
 
04:35:38.029 --> 04:35:38.039 align:start position:0%
process is open uh we have a stakeholder
 
04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
process that um is open to the public
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
there are restrictions around
 
04:35:43.750 --> 04:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
information that is accessible because
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
we do deal with critical energy
 
04:35:47.949 --> 04:35:47.959 align:start position:0%
infrastructure information so we don't
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
want to put a blueprint out into the um
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
public domain for people who might want
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
to sabotage the grid but we do try to do
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
planning in a an open process where
 
04:36:01.310 --> 04:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
people can see um what's under study and
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
every couple years we put together a a
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
report which wraps up uh many of the
 
04:36:07.470 --> 04:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
transmission planning studies and we
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
refer to that as our regional system
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
plan or RSP we did that 2023 we're going
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
to do that again in
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
2025 so I mentioned our planning Horizon
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
goes out 5 to 10 years and we didn't
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
have authorization from our regulator FK
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
to look beyond that and it does get
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
challenging to predict what the future
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be Beyond uh 10 years um but
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
we do know that this um many of the
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
states in the region have goals on the
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
electrification side and the
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
decarbonization side out to 2035 2040
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
and 2050
 
04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
so we've had to go to firk get approval
 
04:36:46.590 --> 04:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
to start looking longer term and and
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
we've gotten F's approval for that the
 
04:36:51.551 --> 04:36:51.561 align:start position:0%
New England states developed in uh 2020
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
a renewable uh energy Vision uh this was
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
through the New England states committee
 
04:36:56.279 --> 04:36:56.990 align:start position:0%
through the New England states committee
on

04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
electricity uh all the states were a
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
part of that uh New Hampshire was was a
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
part of that uh process uh to some
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
degree and so the state said ISO we want
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
to look at scenarios for transmission to
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
support the electric electrification uh
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
of Transportation primarily and heating
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
in the wintertime so we did a big study
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
called the 2050 transmission study first
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
really long-term uh plan and Nathan if
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
you'll Jump Ahead uh to the
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
Chart uh this is showing uh really two
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
things what is our summer peak in yellow
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
and our winter peak in blue and 2023
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that we were as Nathan
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
said a summer peaking system we do have
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
a winter Peak but it's lower than the
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
summer but over time if we in fact do
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
see electrification of Transportation in
 
04:37:50.429 --> 04:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
buildings and by buildings I mean
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
instead of using fossil fuels natural
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
gas uh heating oil for buildings you
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
have heat pumps and other electrified
 
04:38:00.070 --> 04:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
Technologies um so then you're going to
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
see significant growth so the 2050 study
 
04:38:06.750 --> 04:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
asked what would the transmission system
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
need to look like in order to
 
04:38:11.470 --> 04:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
serve uh those higher electrification de
 
04:38:14.349 --> 04:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
demands and so if you step back from
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
this chart the the demand on the grid is
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
in a sense going to double so it's a
 
04:38:22.590 --> 04:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's a big uh big increase uh but it's
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
over a number of years out to
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
2050 um and we would shift to being a
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
winter peaking system so um Nathan if
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
you just back
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
up on the longer term transmission
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
planning side the 2050 study was not a
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
plan it didn't commit anybody to build
 
04:38:44.189 --> 04:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
transmission uh the states and the iso
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
have since gone to firk and got approval
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
for a process where the states could in
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
fact uh identify transmission they
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to build and develop uh to meet
 
04:38:56.189 --> 04:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
those longer term goals and we are
 
04:38:59.830 --> 04:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
currently uh working to develop an RFP
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
request for proposals for
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
transmission and this is in close
 
04:39:05.551 --> 04:39:05.561 align:start position:0%
coordination with States through the New
 
04:39:07.869 --> 04:39:07.879 align:start position:0%
England um States committee on
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
electricity uh or Nesco um and new
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
hampsh is a is a is a member of Nesco
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
and is is part of uh those conversations
 
04:39:19.070 --> 04:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
so the 2050 study is available it's
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
complete and there's a a short fact
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
sheet we've linked to the presentation
 
04:39:24.750 --> 04:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants a little bit more
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
that and Mr chair I'll take a cue from
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
you on time we have a few more slides to
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
cover on some different study
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
work yes please continue okay so another
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
area that we've looked at is um not a
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
reliability study necessarily but uh an
 
04:39:47.628 --> 04:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
economic planning study for the region
 
04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
uh this one has the title economic
 
04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
planning for the clean energy transition
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not just looking at uh the
 
04:39:57.150 --> 04:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
load growth but it's looking at the
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
policies that the states have
 
04:40:02.830 --> 04:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
set and most of the states and I'm very
 
04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
mindful of where I'm at uh here in
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
conquer but most of the states are
 
04:40:09.150 --> 04:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
looking for deep reductions in carbon
 
04:40:11.470 --> 04:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
emissions so we have to model the system
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
based on what that would look like so we
 
04:40:16.830 --> 04:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
take the existing Fleet of
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
Generation Um we take uh proposals that
 
04:40:22.190 --> 04:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
have gone through the queue and have
 
04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
been approved and then we figure out how
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
much new resource capability would we
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
need in New England to develop a
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
resource mix that meets those State
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
policy goals uh the report took a couple
 
04:40:35.708 --> 04:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
of years again it was done through an
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
open process and all the results are
 
04:40:40.948 --> 04:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
public but it really makes you think
 
04:40:40.958 --> 04:40:41.910 align:start position:0%
public but it really makes you think
about

04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
balancing three uh different uh factors
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
one is the
 
04:40:50.230 --> 04:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
economics uh second is uh the
 
04:40:52.990 --> 04:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
carbon uh the carbon profile and the
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
third is
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
reliability um and so it's like a
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool in in some respect
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
and our job as Nathan said at the
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
beginning is thinking about the
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
reliability of the system and our vision
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
is as the States move to a system system
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
that has a uh clean uh
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
decarbonized uh Energy Mix we want to
 
04:41:20.030 --> 04:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can keep the lights on
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the duration of uh of this
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
journey so this study gave us some uh
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
insights into what would what are some
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that New England
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
including the iso will face
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
um these are some of the key findings
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll highlight these
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to see very sign
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
significant variabil in both the supply
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
demand what does that mean
 
04:41:49.708 --> 04:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
well depending on what the weather's
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
like uh in the winter if you Electrify
 
04:41:54.990 --> 04:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
buildings for heating purposes if you
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a really cold winter that means
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
that year the demand's going to be
 
04:42:00.270 --> 04:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
really high if you have a mild witer the
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
demand's going to be pretty low so
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to build a system
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
to meet the higher demand but some of
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
those resources are going to be idle in
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
in uh in years when it's milder um now
 
04:42:16.510 --> 04:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to build a resource and
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
then be idle um they want to run and so
 
04:42:22.510 --> 04:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
if there's more generation than we need
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
to meet demand then we would actually
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
curtail those resources but it does
 
04:42:28.110 --> 04:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
present an opportunity to charge
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
batteries for example so if you develop
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
a bunch of offshore wind and it's
 
04:42:35.708 --> 04:42:35.718 align:start position:0%
producing more than you have um needs
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
for electricity maybe that's when
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to be uh charging or
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
there's discussion about looking at
 
04:42:44.910 --> 04:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
um hydrogen and it's a very energy
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
intensive to produce uh clean hydrogen
 
04:42:50.910 --> 04:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
so maybe the Surplus um offshore wind as
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
one example could be used uh for that
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
purpose but from a planning perspective
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
we could see big swings and what the
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
demand would be year to year as we're
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
now tying heating to what's happening on
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
the electric
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
grid um the second finding is related uh
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
to emissions and well I know that
 
04:43:16.030 --> 04:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's a desire to decarbonize the grid
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a desire to decarbonize the
 
04:43:22.110 --> 04:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
economy um it's going to be hard to do
 
04:43:25.230 --> 04:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
that completely and so there will be
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
times when we can probably decarbonize
 
04:43:30.190 --> 04:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
fully in the spring and the fall when
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
you have lots of um renewable uh
 
04:43:35.948 --> 04:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
production and the demand is a little
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
bit lower it's going to be harder to
 
04:43:40.270 --> 04:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
decarbonize in the winter when you've
 
04:43:43.150 --> 04:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
got really high demand and uh I don't
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
know if do we show that in I we don't
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
show that in this chart but there's um
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
some exhibits within the upset report
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
which will show we're going to get to a
 
04:43:54.190 --> 04:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
decarbonized state in this 2050 time
 
04:43:57.310 --> 04:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
frame uh for most of the year but it's
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to be really hard to get fully
 
04:44:01.868 --> 04:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
decarbonized uh in the winter so that's
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
on the emission side um when we think
 
04:44:06.110 --> 04:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
about the renewable
 
04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
buildout and I think some of you have
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
kind of sensed this if you have a 100
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh wind farm that wind farm is
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
not going to produce 100 megawatts all
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
the time um a an existing gas fired
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
plant or a nuclear plant they provide a
 
04:44:26.190 --> 04:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
pretty steady output or they're
 
04:44:29.070 --> 04:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
dispatchable whenever we need them so if
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're really going to build a system
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
Around clean and renewable energy you're
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to build more than you
 
04:44:37.280 --> 04:44:38.430 align:start position:0%
going to have to build more than you
would

04:44:38.430 --> 04:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
need because the output of those wind
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
facilities is not going to be 100% all
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
the time they might have a name plate
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
rating but their actual output is
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
dependent on what's happening with the
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
weather so I noticed you use the word
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
vast in the bullet renewable only build
 
04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
outs may be vast is the word vast going
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
to be applied to the cost of these of
 
04:45:02.120 --> 04:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
to be applied to the cost of these of
this

04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
buildout um it it's going to cost a a
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
lot of money to develop new resources in
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
New England whether you're talking about
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
wind whether you're talking
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
about um new types of nuclear technology
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh none of these Technologies are cheap
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
um so this epet resport epet report is
 
04:45:26.670 --> 04:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
not looking at like the cost allocation
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for all this or how's
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
it going to be allocated among the
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
states it's really just looking at what
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
what would the system look like in order
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
to meet those decarbonization goals and
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
to give you a frame of reference for
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
vast the New England power grid today
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
has about 30,00
 
04:45:44.310 --> 04:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
megawatts of generation Our Peak demand
 
04:45:46.830 --> 04:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
is about 28,000 so we're kind of Surplus
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
on paper for Our
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
Generation Um the epet report identified
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we would need to add about uh 97
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
gws or
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
97,000 megawatts on a system that's
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
already 30,000 so when we say vast you
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
need to develop a lot of resources to
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
get all of your energy from wind and
 
04:46:13.708 --> 04:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
solar and batteries are a part of the
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
study as well so the last point in the
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
study is you're still going to need
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
resources that are dispatchable that's
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
very important to the iso because we
 
04:46:22.920 --> 04:46:24.110 align:start position:0%
very important to the iso because we
don't

04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
want to disconnect anybody from the
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
system because you know the demand is
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
really high in any given day from from
 
04:46:34.030 --> 04:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
July 1 1997 we've been focused on
 
04:46:36.190 --> 04:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
keeping the lights on uh in the region
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
so we're going to need resources that
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
can ramp up and down today that's
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
natural gas uh there may be
 
04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies uh smrs in the future that
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
could provide uh that capability and and
 
04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
things that aren't even commercial at
 
04:46:50.548 --> 04:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
that point we're going to be counting
 
04:46:51.510 --> 04:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
them but you're going to need
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
dispatchable resources and lots of them
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
in a system where you're using lots of
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
resources and that's representative
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
Bernardi would like to ask a
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
question so considering the need for
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
dispatchable resources have you looked
 
04:47:15.990 --> 04:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
gas so New England's pretty constrained
 
04:47:23.150 --> 04:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not a secret and in years
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
past the iso has talked about uh natural
 
04:47:31.150 --> 04:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
gas um gas fired power plants being
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
constrained in the winter particularly
 
04:47:34.350 --> 04:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue so much in the
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
summertime because there's no heating
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
demand that's drawing on natural gas um
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
but the region is effectively said no
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
they're not going to develop more
 
04:47:45.510 --> 04:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas infrastructure and one of
 
04:47:47.070 --> 04:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
the first slides Nathan talked about is
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
what we don't do we don't plan the fuel
 
04:47:52.708 --> 04:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
side of the system we spent a lot of
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
time thinking about it because Gas and
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
Electric are closely
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
interrelated um but a decision to
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
develop fuel infrastructure would have
 
04:48:08.910 --> 04:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
iso representative uh schneller has a
 
04:48:16.830 --> 04:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman Vose uh
 
04:48:20.110 --> 04:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
you've referenced zero carbon
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
decarbonization several
 
04:48:25.990 --> 04:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
times is that a baseline assumption for
 
04:48:27.390 --> 04:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
everything we're talking about is there
 
04:48:31.548 --> 04:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
a study that leads you to all of these I
 
04:48:33.868 --> 04:48:33.878 align:start position:0%
I guess these are conclusions and and
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're basing your planning
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
on decarbonization is is there a study
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we could reference
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
um that you're basing all of these
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions on in other words is there
 
04:48:48.990 --> 04:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
another direction to go
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you could think of the study I was
 
04:48:55.470 --> 04:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
just talking about the epet study as um
 
04:48:59.070 --> 04:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
a scenario analysis we're not saying the
 
04:49:03.230 --> 04:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
region should or will develop the
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
resources that are identified in this
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
plan but it was based on the
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
decarbonization and the electrification
 
04:49:10.440 --> 04:49:11.430 align:start position:0%
decarbonization and the electrification
goal

04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
goal
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
of most of the states in New England
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
that's what's driving it and we could go
 
04:49:19.868 --> 04:49:19.878 align:start position:0%
in another direction we could we could
 
04:49:22.548 --> 04:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
see uh different Technologies come
 
04:49:22.558 --> 04:49:24.190 align:start position:0%
see uh different Technologies come
forward

04:49:24.190 --> 04:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
um but the the primary policy direction
 
04:49:31.390 --> 04:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
from most New England is they want to uh
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
shut down older fossil plants uh
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
eventually most of the fossil Fleet and
 
04:49:41.150 --> 04:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
have a system that is um
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
renewable and you know by state
 
04:49:46.110 --> 04:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
definition clean I mean clean is not a
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
technical term that comes from the iso
 
04:49:51.230 --> 04:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
but could we go in a different direction
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
yes but that's the really the
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
prerogative of policy makers like you
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
and your colleagues in the other
 
04:50:01.270 --> 04:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
states thank you Vice chair
 
04:50:03.470 --> 04:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you thanks for taking my
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
question so I just want to clarify a
 
04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
statement that you made involving you
 
04:50:11.230 --> 04:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't get involved with the fuels um
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
so am I right to understand then what
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
you meant was you can put out a
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
report that shows the projections of
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
what's coming down line and let's say
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
you are aware of we're we're not going
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
to have enough base load but you can't
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
put out
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
a an indication that hey we need to put
 
04:50:41.470 --> 04:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
some fuel plants in some areas here to
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have enough in the
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
future you you are are you implying that
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
you just you put out the info of what's
 
04:50:49.948 --> 04:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
out there or what's coming and you hope
 
04:50:52.548 --> 04:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
that either the some private entity or
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
some State comes over and says hey we're
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to build something well I think it
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
comes back to what's our Authority under
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
the federal power act and Authority that
 
04:51:05.270 --> 04:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
FK has given to us uh it is only for the
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
Electric System so we do a lot of
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
analysis uh that looks at the fuel
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
system but we really rely on the markets
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
to drive incentives for investment in
 
04:51:16.440 --> 04:51:17.788 align:start position:0%
to drive incentives for investment in
resources

04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
so let's assume that we're not going to
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
see more gas pipeline into the region to
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
support Power Generation Well the other
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
option is that a gas fired generator
 
04:51:30.910 --> 04:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
could develop on-site fuel oil
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
capability as a backup resource so if
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
they can't pull fuel from the pipelines
 
04:51:39.070 --> 04:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
they could use uh inventory on site or
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
they could contract for l G to be
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
imported into New England through Boston
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
or New Brunswick so yeah we're
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
identifying what the I guess some of the
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
the risks are uh for the system but we
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do an RFP for gas pipeline
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
for example um the developers of the new
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
resources have to figure out how they're
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to get their fuel um I mean wind
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
is a resource that has no has no fuel
 
04:52:08.430 --> 04:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
but of course the capital costs are
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
substantial so they have to figure out
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
how to get Capital to develop those
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
resources I noticed that none of the
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
charts that you've shown us here today
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
talk about net Imports but when I look
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
at the iso to go app I frequently see
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
that net Imports are supplying a
 
04:52:32.270 --> 04:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of our electricity
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
like right now it's 211% I just
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
looked where does that electricity
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
typically come from is that from Canada
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
typically yeah so I think Nathan showed
 
04:52:45.470 --> 04:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
it in one of the earlier slides um
 
04:52:47.788 --> 04:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
annually over the past decade between 13
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
and 19% of our electricity needs in New
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
England come from Imports um most of it
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
is from Quebec and you can think of uh
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
Hydro Quebec as 98% you know Hydro um we
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
can import power from New Brunswick that
 
04:53:06.590 --> 04:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
could be whatever is operating on their
 
04:53:08.110 --> 04:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
system but they have the Point lepro
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
Nuclear facility they have wind as well
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
um the primary flow is north to south so
 
04:53:18.030 --> 04:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
from Canada into New England and then
 
04:53:20.350 --> 04:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
out to New York um based on the
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
economics so Canada wants to sell to us
 
04:53:26.310 --> 04:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a attractive market for
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
them as a seller and New York has high
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
demands so they typically want to buy
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
Power from New England uh as well but
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing on the app is a
 
04:53:37.628 --> 04:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
snapshot which is going to change you
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
know minute to minute but on an annual
 
04:53:41.708 --> 04:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
basis you you know it's in the teens the
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity that comes from
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
Imports representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:53:51.548 --> 04:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair um thank you for
 
04:53:53.230 --> 04:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
being here it's good to see you guys
 
04:53:53.240 --> 04:53:54.510 align:start position:0%
being here it's good to see you guys
again

04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
um we know that our climate is becoming
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
unpredictable um we've got more winds
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
we've got more flooding and we have more
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
storms um I saw the predictions of the
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
charts for everything that's in the
 
04:54:09.150 --> 04:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
queue and I saw the the slide you didn't
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
cover it but the one with the pill
 
04:54:14.910 --> 04:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if uh climate
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
resiliency is in your
 
04:54:21.948 --> 04:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
purview not explicitly but we've started
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
to do some uh probabilistic studies of
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh extreme
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
weather and so that's uh through a new
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
tool that we've developed probabilistic
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
energy adequacy tool Pete and uh that
 
04:54:40.750 --> 04:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
gives us a sense of um can we operate
 
04:54:42.910 --> 04:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
the system on the really
 
04:54:45.670 --> 04:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
extreme uh weather that we've seen if
 
04:54:47.708 --> 04:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
you go back to like 1970 there are times
 
04:54:49.548 --> 04:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
when there's pretty extreme weather it's
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
hard to forecast like when is that
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
extreme weather going to show up again
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
right um but we do have some new tools
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the states and when I I've used the
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
states a number of times but when I talk
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
about the states It's usually the public
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
utility commissions and the folks from
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
Nesco who are sort of looking long-term
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
at the resource mix and so they've said
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
ISO can you help us sort of gauge what
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
are some of the risks of extreme weather
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
so we now have those tools uh we
 
04:55:19.470 --> 04:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
developed that for this winter we use
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
that new uh model uh it showed us that
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
we have adequate resources for uh this
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
winter but if you take a number of
 
04:55:30.350 --> 04:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
Legacy resources off the system add a
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
bunch of the resources that are in the
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
queue that's going to change um how the
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
systems going to operate and that tool
 
04:55:39.150 --> 04:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
lets us do a Refresh on an at least an
 
04:55:41.548 --> 04:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
annual basis or more often to figure out
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
how do how do we plan for that extreme
 
04:55:46.990 --> 04:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
weather and at some point New England
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
may decide we need to hedge against some
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
of these risks um and so there's a
 
04:55:54.510 --> 04:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
process that's underway right now uh
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's looking at what we call Regional
 
04:55:58.110 --> 04:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
energy uh shortfall
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
threshold and the states are involved uh
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
in that so the I think of the iso as a
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
entity that can provide a lot of
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
technical analysis to the states that
 
04:56:09.868 --> 04:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
individually they not might not possess
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then helps them figure out you know
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
which transmission projects do they want
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
to build uh which um you know resources
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
for reliability what might we need to uh
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
think differently about
 
04:56:24.910 --> 04:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
so so not explicitly but we try to
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
provide some analysis to inform policy
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
makers about that excellent thank you
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
very much representative
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah thank you Mr chair and then
 
04:56:36.910 --> 04:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen for coming in uh
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
today uh is that for two questions is
 
04:56:42.548 --> 04:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
that that Pete publicly accessible and
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
secondly uh just an engineering question
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh about the Imports coming in from
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
Quebec and New York state or mainly
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
about Quebec I guess because that's
 
04:56:52.590 --> 04:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
coming through New Hampshire that
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
transmission line uh is any of that
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
electricity are those electrons ever
 
04:56:58.590 --> 04:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
flowing into New Hampshire or are they
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
going straight to Southern New England I
 
04:57:02.548 --> 04:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about that so on the
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
first question yes everything related to
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
the Pete tool is public it's on our
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
website if if we don't have a link to it
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
in the presentation Nathan will follow
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
and make that uh available
 
04:57:16.750 --> 04:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
um does the imports
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
from Quebec flow into New
 
04:57:19.840 --> 04:57:21.788 align:start position:0%
from Quebec flow into New
Hampshire

04:57:21.788 --> 04:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
um I I would say yes but it's really
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
flowing into the entire New England pool
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
when you come to the iso and look at the
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
big board and we'd love to have you come
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
down you're not going to see the state
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the boundaries of the
 
04:57:36.430 --> 04:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
state or any other state it's it's the
 
04:57:38.110 --> 04:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
electric transmission system and
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
electrons don't really respect State
 
04:57:39.878 --> 04:57:41.548 align:start position:0%
electrons don't really respect State
Bound

04:57:41.548 --> 04:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
Bound
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
um so you could probably uh quantify
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
that but it's really coming into the
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
system as a whole and then that the
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
amount of transmission you have will
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
determine where that power
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
flows representative Corman thank you Mr
 
04:57:57.548 --> 04:57:57.558 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here uh
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
I looked through the slides I don't you
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
haven't talked about and there isn't
 
04:58:02.548 --> 04:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
anything in the slides about the uh the
 
04:58:05.230 --> 04:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
auctions the day ahead and spot Market
 
04:58:08.788 --> 04:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
auctions that that ISO operates and I'm
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering um money's coming in
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
money's going out ultimately it's going
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
to uh I would imagine the the actual
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
generators uh how much of it is actually
 
04:58:24.030 --> 04:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
flowing through ISO or or are you just
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
conducting an auction and and not
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
handling the money and a related
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
question where does your funding come
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
from okay good question so I'll take the
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
last one first so there's a um what we
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
call a tariff which is a document that
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
we file with FK to recover our cost
 
04:58:42.270 --> 04:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
and because we're we didn't say this but
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're a nonprofit so we can't make any
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
profit on what's happening in the in the
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
wholesale market so we do a forecast of
 
04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
what our Revenue requirements are would
 
04:58:52.270 --> 04:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
be for the year and we develop a budget
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then we collect a essentially a fee
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
from all the participants in the market
 
04:58:58.590 --> 04:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
so larger participants are going to
 
04:59:00.390 --> 04:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
contribute more to that uh smaller
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
resources would contribute less uh at
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the year we have to do a true
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
up so if we collect more Revenue than we
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
need we don't keep it it goes into the
 
04:59:12.548 --> 04:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
adjustment for the following year um we
 
04:59:14.948 --> 04:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
file a budget with firk we meet with all
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
the states uh each year to discuss the
 
04:59:20.190 --> 04:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
budget uh verk approves it it's on a
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
calendary year so usually goes in uh
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
October they approve it by December and
 
04:59:27.070 --> 04:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's effective uh January one uh the
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
budget for the iso is about uh $200
 
04:59:33.110 --> 04:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
million and that's for all the
 
04:59:35.070 --> 04:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
operations in western Mass and then we
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a redundant facility in Connecticut
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
so that's all we own just those two
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
properties nothing out in the field um
 
04:59:46.030 --> 04:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the auctions we run a lot of
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
auctions we run auctions on a daily
 
04:59:51.788 --> 04:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
basis for the energy market and we run
 
04:59:55.150 --> 04:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
auctions on a forward basis for uh
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
capacity although we've we've paused on
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
that uh we have a project that's
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
examining how we do procurements for
 
05:00:04.548 --> 05:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
capacity instead of looking three years
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
into the future we propose that we do
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
those auctions on a uh on an annual
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
basis um with some different products
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
but the I think what you're getting to
 
05:00:19.150 --> 05:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
is the the auctions for energy on a
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
daily basis so uh every resource is
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
offering to sell Power into the market
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned generators but it could be
 
05:00:30.310 --> 05:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh suppliers they might not own power
 
05:00:31.830 --> 05:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
plants but they have arrangements with
 
05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
other resources somebody might be lining
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
up power from Quebec or in New York and
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
so we look at what's the demand and we
 
05:00:44.350 --> 05:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
select the lowest price resources on the
 
05:00:46.590 --> 05:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
system and when those things come into
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
balance then that sets the clearing
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
price uh for the
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
market that money will flow through the
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
iso for um for the system what we what
 
05:01:00.030 --> 05:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
we don't uh control
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
is um outof Market agreements or
 
05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
purchase power
 
05:01:07.270 --> 05:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
agreements um that's not regulated or
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
under uh our jurisdiction so
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we would collect essentially
 
05:01:15.030 --> 05:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
payments from load or utilities or
 
05:01:16.990 --> 05:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
suppliers and make payments to the
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
resources that provided the power uh for
 
05:01:22.110 --> 05:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
those auction periods and we've got a
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
one-day class if you want to learn about
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
that it's just for public officials and
 
05:01:26.788 --> 05:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
Regulators you might be a great
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
candidate for
 
05:01:31.548 --> 05:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
that representative Summers has your
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question last term we
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
had a uh if I remember correctly
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve where we had a a cold snap
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
here in New England and uh where on the
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
rates on even on your site where
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
kilowatt per hour went up to close to
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
$3,000 per kilowatt temporarily because
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
of the um because of that and um with
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
the with the risk of rolling blackouts
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
near in the uh North North part of New
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and with that at that same
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
time I believe if correct me if I'm
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
wrong I believe Mystic was shut down
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily at that time so um the
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
firing up of the B the bow coal plant
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
had to be had to take effect for that
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
and um now with Mystic being shut down
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
permanently uh how what how are we
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
protected or how's what's the remedy for
 
05:02:25.548 --> 05:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
if this happens again where we have a
 
05:02:28.110 --> 05:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
cold snap like this and the price of the
 
05:02:30.750 --> 05:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
is this where the um snapshot pricing
 
05:02:32.590 --> 05:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
comes into effect yeah you can see
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
pricing in real time the mobile app has
 
05:02:37.628 --> 05:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
it the iso website has it
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
um we were not in New England England uh
 
05:02:43.548 --> 05:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
close to Rolling blackouts on Christmas
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
Eve other parts of the country were in a
 
05:02:47.548 --> 05:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
very deep freeze they had some serious
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
reliability uh challenges some parts of
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
the country were doing controlled
 
05:02:54.030 --> 05:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
outages or load shedding um we
 
05:02:56.190 --> 05:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
instituted some very low-level
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
procedures uh capacity deficiency
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
procedures um but we did not get
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the edge of uh reliability
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
risks on on Christmas Eve um but the
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
Mystic plants two large gas fired plants
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
are now retired um and so what that
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
means is every other resource in the
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
system then becomes uh a candidate to
 
05:03:23.548 --> 05:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
replace that energy so maybe a resource
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
that didn't get called on because the
 
05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
Mystic was running would now be called
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
on and it could be one of
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
the one of the coal plants uh
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
potentially but we know they're going to
 
05:03:35.910 --> 05:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
retire at some point
 
05:03:38.430 --> 05:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have new Supply
 
05:03:40.990 --> 05:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
coming down from Quebec from the New
 
05:03:47.230 --> 05:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:50.190 --> 05:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
so we we can't keep plants that are
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
online from retiring I mean the Mystic
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
plant we we held them for two years
 
05:03:56.590 --> 05:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
under a very controversial arrangement
 
05:03:59.230 --> 05:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
with um the owners it had to go to FK
 
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
for approval people did not like it um
 
05:04:04.030 --> 05:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
but the iso doesn't have the ability to
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
say you should build this plant or you
 
05:04:07.948 --> 05:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
can't retire this plant we're kind of
 
05:04:10.110 --> 05:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with the uh we deal with the cards
 
05:04:12.270 --> 05:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
were dealt in that respect but other
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
resources have to make up that that Gap
 
05:04:18.150 --> 05:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um along that line of last
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
questioning I recall I think it was a
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago might have been
 
05:04:28.350 --> 05:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
three I'm not sure that that ISO put out
 
05:04:32.110 --> 05:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
a notice primarily to the utilities to
 
05:04:34.750 --> 05:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
effectively brush up on their uh
 
05:04:37.708 --> 05:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
emergency blackout procedures because uh
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
the notice effectively said that there
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
was increased risk in the next few years
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
depending on how severe the winter
 
05:04:48.910 --> 05:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
weather was of potential to have rolling
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
blackouts um so along that line um I
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
think one part of your emission that we
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
haven't heard too much here is uh one of
 
05:05:00.670 --> 05:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
your major portions of your mission is
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
to actually manage the grid we have a
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
couple of we have several new members
 
05:05:08.670 --> 05:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
here could you could you go into a short
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
description of how your control room
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
managed the grid and what happens and
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
how they tell utilities when to turn on
 
05:05:18.190 --> 05:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
when to turn off turn off and so forth
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
here a little brief overview because
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
that is a major part of of your mission
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so um let's imagine that everybody
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
in this room at the table uh owns some
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
type of generation okay um
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan uh owns a resource
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
expensive and representative Plaza
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
PL right he owns the
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
resource that's uh relatively
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and so we're going to stack
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
up all these resources from highest
 
05:05:54.110 --> 05:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
price to lowest price um the the amount
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
of resources that we call on is only
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
based on what we expect to be used and
 
05:06:00.070 --> 05:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
it usually lands somewhere in the middle
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
all right so that means all of these
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
resources are going to get picked all
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
these resources would not get picked
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
that day they don't run they don't get
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
paid uh but if the were to go up we
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
might have to go a little further into
 
05:06:14.910 --> 05:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
that resource mix and maybe a resource
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
that didn't get picked and the previous
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
hour gets picked in the next hour so the
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
iso is doing that um continuously
 
05:06:24.430 --> 05:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the day turning resources on
 
05:06:27.150 --> 05:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
and off to meet the demand or ramping uh
 
05:06:29.310 --> 05:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
up and down that's our reliability
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
function and we've done that since uh 19
 
05:06:32.400 --> 05:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
function and we've done that since uh 19
uh

05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
97 the utilities don't own generation
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
for the most part uh in New England so
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the utilities that are offering
 
05:06:43.948 --> 05:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
to sell Power it's private companies
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
that that are doing that but if we get
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
into an
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
emergency uh we'll call on every
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
resource that's available uh we'll go
 
05:06:53.868 --> 05:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
all the way up the supply stack no
 
05:06:55.830 --> 05:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
matter how expensive it is if we need it
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
to keep the lights on but there might be
 
05:07:00.030 --> 05:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
a point where the demand goes past the
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
resources that we have and maybe our
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors don't have any more power to
 
05:07:05.470 --> 05:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
send to us so we do have emergency
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
procedures where we'd reach out to the
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
utilities to say they need to take
 
05:07:11.948 --> 05:07:11.958 align:start position:0%
demand off the system uh we've never had
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
to do that uh but we to representative
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas's um point we have talked to you
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
utilities and make sure that if we got
 
05:07:22.830 --> 05:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
to that state that they could respond
 
05:07:24.430 --> 05:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
why would we do that well people might
 
05:07:26.190 --> 05:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
say well that's terrible why would the
 
05:07:28.750 --> 05:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
iso order the utilities to cut people's
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
power because we're trying to keep the
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
whole grid operating and if you let
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
demand go past what you have for Supply
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
the grid becomes unstable and instead of
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
a few customers losing power the whole
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
grid can come down it's never happened
 
05:07:44.350 --> 05:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
so we have emergency procedures to deal
 
05:07:46.510 --> 05:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
with that we take that very seriously
 
05:07:47.910 --> 05:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to know if we tell the
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
utilities they need to take 5% of the
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
demand on the system off or 10% uh they
 
05:07:55.708 --> 05:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
need to do that we can give them that
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
that instruction and under requirements
 
05:08:00.350 --> 05:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
by the North American Electric
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
reliability Corporation they need to act
 
05:08:06.910 --> 05:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
within minutes to make that happen so um
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's a very important part of the
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility now we don't live on the
 
05:08:12.030 --> 05:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
edge like that but you do need to have
 
05:08:15.190 --> 05:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
those procedures in effect thank you
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
that was an excellent description of how
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
your resource stacking Works using this
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
horseshoe okay well done representative
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
Swanson has a
 
05:08:28.750 --> 05:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for being here and the
 
05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
information I find it very insightful to
 
05:08:36.510 --> 05:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
flip between slide 10 and slide
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
15 and uh I you know slide 10 being
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative of
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
2023 and slide 15 being representative
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
of the basket of proposals that you've
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
received for what I would perceive as
 
05:08:54.240 --> 05:08:55.628 align:start position:0%
received for what I would perceive as
proposed

05:08:55.628 --> 05:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
Investments and uh uh what I'm not
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
surprised that the proposals don't
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
include natural gas but I am surprised
 
05:09:09.510 --> 05:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they don't include nuclear
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh can you ex do you have any insight as
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
to why nobody's proposing any
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear I mean an otally only we haven't
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
seen proposals for new nuclear in uh
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
decades we have seen the existing
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants make some improvements at
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
their sites where they can get some
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
additional megawatts out of those plants
 
05:09:37.070 --> 05:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
and so we've captured that and studied
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
it uh in the queue
 
05:09:42.868 --> 05:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
it it again Falls outside of what we can
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
control but the economics of building
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear are um pretty significant the
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
the last nuclear plant to come online
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
down in uh down in the South was the
 
05:09:55.868 --> 05:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
cost overruns were
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
massive um and so the question is well
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
who's going to take the risk that they
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
can build that plant and get that power
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
online um within a budget so down south
 
05:10:11.788 --> 05:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
and and they're not operating in a
 
05:10:13.470 --> 05:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
market system where they're putting
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
private Capital At Risk the rate payers
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
basically bore the cost of that
 
05:10:22.430 --> 05:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
um those overruns so I would be
 
05:10:26.070 --> 05:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
surprised if you saw another Seabrook or
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
Millstone plant developed in New England
 
05:10:29.948 --> 05:10:29.958 align:start position:0%
but you could see somebody say we have a
 
05:10:32.430 --> 05:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
potential for developing small modular
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
reactors uh I we think that's uh that's
 
05:10:37.868 --> 05:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
probably part of the future there's also
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
a a strong nimi sense around nuclear I
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
mean there's people who would say it's
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
clean energy it's dispatchable it has a
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
lot of attributes that we think are
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
valuable our epet study showed that but
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
you still have to convince a community
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
to become a host for one of these
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
facilities thank
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
you okay why don't you guys give us your
 
05:11:03.948 --> 05:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
your final wrap up because we need to
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
move on okay uh it's been an excellent
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
presentation and we thank you for being
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
here uh we'll give you the last word and
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
then um let you get back down to uh
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well why don't we leave
 
05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
with a invite we'd love to have the
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
committee come and visit you've been
 
05:11:21.310 --> 05:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
down before uh we'll show you the
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
operations center uh we'll dive a little
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
bit deeper into some of these topics and
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's always been a valuable
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you and for us to learn
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
about what's on your mind and show you
 
05:11:34.390 --> 05:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
show you the operation that you're a
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
part of thank you for that invitation U
 
05:11:39.788 --> 05:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
many of us have made multiple trips down
 
05:11:41.788 --> 05:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
to ISO New England it's always a
 
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
pleasure to visit there and this being a
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
budget year if we can squeeze that into
 
05:11:49.830 --> 05:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
our schedule we we will attempt to do so
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
it contact information Nathan's going to
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
follow up with the committee to provide
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
both of our contact
 
05:12:02.190 --> 05:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
information and you going to provide
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
those two extra charts we talked about
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think one of them actually I
 
05:12:07.628 --> 05:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
found it in the presentation but we'll
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow maybe i y
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay time to move along so we have
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
another presentation next up on the
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
docket and that is a presentation by New
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's joint
 
05:12:23.070 --> 05:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
utilities The Joint utilities are
 
05:12:25.548 --> 05:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
comprised of eversource Unitil Liberty
 
05:12:27.788 --> 05:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Electric
 
05:12:30.270 --> 05:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
Co-op and I have
 
05:12:33.788 --> 05:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
asked Griffin robarge of ever source to
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
organize the joint utilities
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
presentation and so I'm going to turn
 
05:12:39.680 --> 05:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
presentation and so I'm going to turn
over

05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
to to Griffin in just a
 
05:12:49.230 --> 05:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
moment um the floor and he will lead us
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.430 --> 05:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
presentation it looks like maybe he's
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to pass something out so maybe Mr
 
05:13:01.868 --> 05:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
Lata you could um give us an opening
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
introduction good morning everybody uh
 
05:13:06.510 --> 05:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
for the record Michael Lata uh with
 
05:13:09.150 --> 05:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
eversource energy really appreciate the
 
05:13:12.070 --> 05:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come uh before you today
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh as the chair said we kind of
 
05:13:16.030 --> 05:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
organized uh The Joint utilities
 
05:13:19.470 --> 05:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
together so uh we have one presentation
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
deck that you're all receiving paper
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
copies of uh we'll each kind of take
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
turns coming to the microphone to to
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
present about our individual companies
 
05:13:31.830 --> 05:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
and different topics um with me today is
 
05:13:33.990 --> 05:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh Griffin Roberge I'm uh the director
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
of government and community relations
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
for eversource here in New Hampshire uh
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
Griffin is our manager of government
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh for eversource we have a
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
handful of slides to go through um
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the time we'll try to move
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
through those quickly um you know if
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's if it's okay with the chair we'd be
 
05:13:54.470 --> 05:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions as we move along
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but I would just say Griffin and I
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
are are here a lot uh and so if you
 
05:14:01.708 --> 05:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
don't catch us or we don't have time to
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
answer your question you can either ask
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
us later today you can call us email us
 
05:14:08.270 --> 05:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
or I'm quite certain we'll be here next
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:15.628 --> 05:14:15.638 align:start position:0%
after so thank you Mike uh again I think
 
05:14:17.948 --> 05:14:17.958 align:start position:0%
this committee is uh aware of me Griffin
 
05:14:19.990 --> 05:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
robers manager of government Affairs at
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
eversource now um I wanted to obviously
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
following up on what Mike said Thank you
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
for allowing us to uh present today and
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations to each of you on your
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
elections or re-elections um as Mike
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned we'll be here regularly so
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
feel free to reach out if you have any
 
05:14:37.310 --> 05:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
questions or constituent issues uh and
 
05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
that type of thing happy to assist where
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
we can can um so a little bit about
 
05:14:44.548 --> 05:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
eversource um we provide electric gas
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
and water service to our customers
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
across three states in New England
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire Connecticut and
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all told across those
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
three states eversource serves about 4.4
 
05:14:58.470 --> 05:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
million customers in New Hampshire Alone
 
05:15:01.868 --> 05:15:01.878 align:start position:0%
um eversource provides about um sorry
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
provides electric service to about
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
550,000 retail customers as well as
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
about 184,000 wholesale cust customers
 
05:15:11.590 --> 05:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
these These are customers who tend to be
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
served by other utilities like unitel
 
05:15:17.110 --> 05:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal Utilities the co-op um but
 
05:15:19.070 --> 05:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
they may utilize our infrastructure to
 
05:15:20.910 --> 05:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
serve their customers in their
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
territories um we here in the state
 
05:15:26.070 --> 05:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
eversource has we have about 1,500
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
employees who do anything from Line work
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency customer service or
 
05:15:34.150 --> 05:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
government Affairs um these employees
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
operate out of uh different offices
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
across the state uh our headquarters is
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire is located in
 
05:15:43.270 --> 05:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh called Energy Park and our
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
employees also work out of any one of
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
the 15 area work centers uh across the
 
05:15:50.670 --> 05:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
state such as in Nashua Lancaster Kean
 
05:15:52.510 --> 05:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester number of them across the
 
05:15:55.070 --> 05:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
state and so many of our line Crews tend
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
to operate out of these locations doing
 
05:15:58.750 --> 05:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
various things on our on our system such
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
as pole replacement vegetation
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
management installing new service for
 
05:16:05.350 --> 05:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
customers those types of things um we
 
05:16:07.548 --> 05:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
are also responsible as the large as the
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
largest electric utility in the state
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
State um for uh we're responsible for
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
1,000 miles of transmission
 
05:16:16.548 --> 05:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as well as 14,000 Mi of
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
distribution line um so we continually
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
strive to ensure the resiliency of our
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
system of our infrastructure um and
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
provide customers with safe and reliable
 
05:16:28.750 --> 05:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
service to continue to meet or exceed
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
their expectations so I'll turn it back
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
over to Mike to give a little bit more
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
of an overview on how the brid works
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
thanks Griffin um just one quick note
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
here uh folks uh are familiar with the
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
the name uh PSNH Public Service of New
 
05:16:46.030 --> 05:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would just note that still
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
is our legal name uh we are public
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
service in New Hampshire doing business
 
05:16:54.030 --> 05:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
as eversource en as eversource energy uh
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for that is PSNH is
 
05:16:58.628 --> 05:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
referenced in many many uh State
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
statutes and so in order to affect that
 
05:17:02.510 --> 05:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
change we would have to come to you to
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
change many of those State
 
05:17:08.190 --> 05:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
statutes uh so I I know you saw a
 
05:17:09.910 --> 05:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
variation of this slide yesterday with
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy I just want to
 
05:17:13.150 --> 05:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
spend a minute or two on it because I
 
05:17:17.070 --> 05:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
think it is um helpful to Define sort of
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
what companies like uh eversource own
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
what third parties own so uh starting
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
with Generation Um I know you got a
 
05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
presentation from NEP yesterday so in
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
2015 uh eversource PSNH uh did divest of
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
all of our power plants so we are
 
05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
strictly a a poles and wires company uh
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
at this time so so uh generation is
 
05:17:44.030 --> 05:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
owned by Third parties uh and we do
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
procure that power on behalf of our
 
05:17:48.270 --> 05:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
customers uh which is known as default
 
05:17:50.788 --> 05:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
Service uh but that is not something
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
that the the company owns uh
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
anymore uh in terms of what we do own
 
05:17:59.070 --> 05:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
and what we do operate uh we do own uh
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
the transmission system or part of the
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
transmission system in New Hampshire uh
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
these are the the larger higher voltage
 
05:18:08.110 --> 05:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
wires that tend to run uh off-road
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
rights of way
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh those interconnect with substations
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
which is a critical piece of the
 
05:18:17.470 --> 05:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
Electric System uh those substation step
 
05:18:20.430 --> 05:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
down voltages uh and then that feeds
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
into the distribution system you could
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
also have a distribution sub substation
 
05:18:26.470 --> 05:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
where you have multiple circuits that
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
all tie together and then the
 
05:18:30.628 --> 05:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
distribution system which are the poles
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
and wires you largely see uh roadside
 
05:18:36.910 --> 05:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
that provide service um to customers uh
 
05:18:38.190 --> 05:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
and use customers whether they're
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
residential or or business and I I would
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
just note one thing on um this graphic
 
05:18:46.590 --> 05:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
which it shows kind of the traditional
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
um construction of the electricity
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
Network where you have a large power
 
05:18:53.708 --> 05:18:53.718 align:start position:0%
plant transmission set down to
 
05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
distribution uh certainly as as folks
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
are aware uh the power grid has been and
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
continues to be in a state of change
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
where we have customers who are
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
generating uh on site we have multiple
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh flows of power and so you know this
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
is sort of a a very crude kind of
 
05:19:14.910 --> 05:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
traditional uh graphic just to to sort
 
05:19:18.430 --> 05:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.830 --> 05:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
components uh and speaking of of
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
components I find it's always helpful to
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit of a review of
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
customers bills and the electric rates
 
05:19:30.190 --> 05:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
that they pay again I know uh the
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy presented um a pie
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
chart on this yesterday I think they
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
used 650 kilowatt hours uh we used 6 100
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh so if you see slightly different
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
numbers uh that might might uh explain
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
it but just to tick through the
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
different components of the bill and and
 
05:19:50.548 --> 05:19:50.558 align:start position:0%
this is effective as of today as has
 
05:19:52.830 --> 05:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
been mentioned our uh default service
 
05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
rate is scheduled to change uh in in
 
05:19:58.990 --> 05:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
February it will go down to uh 8.9 cents
 
05:20:03.548 --> 05:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
8.9 to9 I believe um but starting with
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
default Service uh that is uh a product
 
05:20:09.708 --> 05:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
that we purchase on on behalf of our
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
customers from the uh regional market so
 
05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh the way that this used to work it was
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit simpler every six months we
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
would issue uh rfps for customer load uh
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
we would get responses back from the
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
marketplace we would select the lowest
 
05:20:27.030 --> 05:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
cost bidder and that was sort of the
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
fixed charge uh that that customers
 
05:20:31.628 --> 05:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
would pay uh this is a direct pass
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
through uh the company does not make any
 
05:20:37.030 --> 05:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh money on this whatever we pay is what
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
our customers uh pay pay uh as
 
05:20:42.868 --> 05:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner chattai discussed yesterday
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
there was a recent change in that where
 
05:20:46.948 --> 05:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
we were directed by the Public Utilities
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
Commission to go direct to the market uh
 
05:20:53.548 --> 05:20:53.558 align:start position:0%
he termed it self-supply so I believe
 
05:20:57.350 --> 05:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's around 30% of our um default
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
service procurement now uh bypasses that
 
05:21:03.788 --> 05:21:03.798 align:start position:0%
RFP and we're purchasing direct from the
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
market and he I in the interest of time
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
I won't go into the reasons behind that
 
05:21:10.350 --> 05:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
thought he did a nice job of explaining
 
05:21:12.830 --> 05:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
the commission's uh thought process
 
05:21:15.070 --> 05:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
there uh default Services where you also
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
see um sort of the charges for uh the
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard are
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with with that state law
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
manifest as well as sort of the what I
 
05:21:27.270 --> 05:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
would call embedded costs of Reggie
 
05:21:29.070 --> 05:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
which I know um was discussed this
 
05:21:31.470 --> 05:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
morning about how Regional power plants
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
sort of build that cost of compliance
 
05:21:36.470 --> 05:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
into uh into their products so that's
 
05:21:38.830 --> 05:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
all contained within the uh default
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
service rate which is the largest single
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
component of the
 
05:21:45.548 --> 05:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
bill uh moving down the distribution
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
charge is really separated into two
 
05:21:50.548 --> 05:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
separate uh charges one is a fixed
 
05:21:52.590 --> 05:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
charge the customer charge this is some
 
05:21:54.910 --> 05:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
kind also called the meter charge it
 
05:21:57.270 --> 05:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
really pays for um the the metering the
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
billing systems kind of that back office
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
that every customer uh relies on
 
05:22:04.030 --> 05:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of the amount of usage and
 
05:22:05.830 --> 05:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
then we have the volumetric uh
 
05:22:08.110 --> 05:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
distribution charge and that is uh an
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
area that that is regulated by the New
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
05:22:15.628 --> 05:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
those rates are set um every few years
 
05:22:17.708 --> 05:22:17.718 align:start position:0%
when a utility files are rate case those
 
05:22:20.670 --> 05:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
are fairly significant undertakings uh
 
05:22:22.830 --> 05:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
we are currently have a rate case before
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission right
 
05:22:27.708 --> 05:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
now uh so that is uh how those rates are
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
Set uh next we have the transmission
 
05:22:33.310 --> 05:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
charge which again is uh pays for that
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh bulk kind of transmission system uh
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
that is as the ISO
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh just discussed regulated by the
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
that rate is really set by each utility
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh customers share of usage during
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
certain peak times so if you imagine the
 
05:22:55.990 --> 05:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
entirety of the cost of of uh the
 
05:22:57.788 --> 05:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
regional transmission system or the
 
05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
local transmission system uh the rate is
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
based upon uh essentially the share of
 
05:23:05.948 --> 05:23:05.958 align:start position:0%
usage during peak time so if someone's
 
05:23:09.150 --> 05:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh one utility is using a lot more uh at
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
that time they would pay a greater share
 
05:23:14.070 --> 05:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
versus a smaller share uh and then
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
finally we have a number of other
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
charges normally I'd group these
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
together but I was asked to kind of
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
explain what each one of these little uh
 
05:23:25.788 --> 05:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
smaller charges is um so one the systems
 
05:23:27.510 --> 05:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
benefits charge I think folks are
 
05:23:29.948 --> 05:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
generally familiar with this pays for
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
both the uh Energy Efficiency programs
 
05:23:34.990 --> 05:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves programs uh that
 
05:23:36.750 --> 05:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
rate has been set into law by this
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
legislature uh just a few years years
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
ago um the the budgets uh for the Energy
 
05:23:44.190 --> 05:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs and then also the uh
 
05:23:46.990 --> 05:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
electric energy assistance program EAP
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
is contained within the systems benefits
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
charge the SCRC or stranded cost
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
recovery charge uh is is now actually
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
more than just stranded costs but that
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh pays for past uh Investments that the
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
utility has made uh that we need to get
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
cost recovery for as well as uh certain
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
purchase power agree payments uh net
 
05:24:11.548 --> 05:24:11.558 align:start position:0%
metering costs are recovered through the
 
05:24:13.948 --> 05:24:13.958 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge as well so
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's the uh payments that we make to uh
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
to those customers who are exporting uh
 
05:24:22.990 --> 05:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
and participating in the net metering
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
program uh for example the Burgess
 
05:24:27.990 --> 05:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
biomass uh purchase power agreement the
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that uh flow
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
through the SCC although you know that
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
has come to an end the the agreement uh
 
05:24:39.390 --> 05:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
the ppam because we don't have enough
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
acronis acronyms is the pole plant
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
adjustment mechanism uh this is uh
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
eversource back in 2023 uh we purchased
 
05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh Consolidated Communications utility
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
polls and this is uh the cost associated
 
05:24:58.948 --> 05:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
with that purchase and be happy to go
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
into a deeper dive at a future time if
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
folks have questions about why we
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
purchase those polls uh and then finally
 
05:25:05.680 --> 05:25:06.470 align:start position:0%
purchase those polls uh and then finally
the

05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:11.548 --> 05:25:11.558 align:start position:0%
r is uh um regulatory reconciliation
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh this is a product of our
 
05:25:18.030 --> 05:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
last rate case where certain charges um
 
05:25:21.310 --> 05:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
including uh some net metering charges
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh consultant charges are are flowed
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
through this actually negative right now
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
so it's actually a credit to customers
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
it's a very very small charge but it
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
does show up on customers bills yes sir
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
say the um Acron regulatory what
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh reconciliation
 
05:25:48.670 --> 05:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
problem yes we can do questions now did
 
05:25:53.750 --> 05:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
you have did somebody have one
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
chair um just you mentioned the rate
 
05:26:02.830 --> 05:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
setting um just curious how that works
 
05:26:06.628 --> 05:26:06.638 align:start position:0%
do you go in with a high level hoping to
 
05:26:08.830 --> 05:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
negotiate it down to something else or
 
05:26:10.548 --> 05:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
do you have to go in with an actual
 
05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
number that it's proven by statistics
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
how does that work yeah thank you for
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the question so uh utilities set rates
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I'll say every few years based upon
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
their earnings so uh the way that it it
 
05:26:30.910 --> 05:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
essentially works is uh we have a test
 
05:26:34.230 --> 05:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
year and during that test year we are
 
05:26:36.708 --> 05:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
looking at all of our our costs our
 
05:26:40.190 --> 05:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
expenses our Capital SP spending uh and
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
clearly documenting that although uh our
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
Regulators look at our actual spending
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond that and so we have an
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
allowed uh rate of return that we're
 
05:26:53.868 --> 05:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to achieve and just to be very
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
clear that's a ceiling not a floor uh a
 
05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
lot of times it gets described as a
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
guaranteed rate of return it is not um
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
so you know our allowed rate of return
 
05:27:09.310 --> 05:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
currently is up to 9.3 3% that was out
 
05:27:12.310 --> 05:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
of our last rate case which was in 2019
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
so we had a test year in 2018 where we
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
sort of documented all of our spending
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
we went to the commission and I believe
 
05:27:21.788 --> 05:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
we were under earning at the time and
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
said these are all all of our spending
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is what we've invested in these are
 
05:27:28.350 --> 05:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
our capital projects and they quite
 
05:27:31.070 --> 05:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
frankly look through the receipts uh and
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
then we would say you know we are not
 
05:27:36.670 --> 05:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
earning near our allowed rate of return
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
We would like to adjust our rate upward
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh in order to allow for the spending
 
05:27:44.470 --> 05:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we need uh to continue the safe and
 
05:27:47.830 --> 05:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
reliable service of of the grid uh so it
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
really is uh it's a voluminous document
 
05:27:52.430 --> 05:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's a series of voluminous documents
 
05:27:54.948 --> 05:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
quite frankly um and they go through all
 
05:27:57.270 --> 05:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
of our Capital spending all of our our
 
05:27:59.590 --> 05:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
expenses there are many rounds of
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
Discovery where they question and prod
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
and ask questions um and so uh it is
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
very much uh based upon our our true
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
costs follow up follow up and is the
 
05:28:16.830 --> 05:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
result either a yes or no or is it a
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
compromise at times uh so there there
 
05:28:22.868 --> 05:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
can be compromise throughout uh so we
 
05:28:25.548 --> 05:28:25.558 align:start position:0%
might uh you know we'll hire experts who
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
say our allowed rate of return should be
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
X and the different parties will hire
 
05:28:33.788 --> 05:28:33.798 align:start position:0%
Consultants who say it should be why
 
05:28:35.990 --> 05:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are lots of different components
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh within uh within this
 
05:28:41.590 --> 05:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh about how the cost of recovery is it
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
how much is in the volumetric charge
 
05:28:46.390 --> 05:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
versus the fixed charge you know it's it
 
05:28:48.510 --> 05:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
can get complicated fast as you might
 
05:28:51.628 --> 05:28:51.638 align:start position:0%
imagine Vice chair Thomas uh thank you
 
05:28:53.708 --> 05:28:53.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
05:28:56.070 --> 05:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
really quick just to clarify so I I have
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
an understanding and for our new members
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
too the um the items you just listed
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
under the um the one from from New
 
05:29:06.910 --> 05:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws and policies if you were
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
to add up those
 
05:29:13.150 --> 05:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
costs and times your 600 kilow that
 
05:29:14.510 --> 05:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be like about
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
month I you know I'm a polyi major and I
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
always make a point not to do math on
 
05:29:27.788 --> 05:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
the fly but that sounds close Yes sounds
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well that that sounds pretty close
 
05:29:31.750 --> 05:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
to my non-mathematical Mone I just want
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we were doing it
 
05:29:35.548 --> 05:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
correctly on this I I I think this is a
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
I would be more than happy to to send
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
information but I think it's around 140
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
or so dollars uh for a customer using uh
 
05:29:48.350 --> 05:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
600 kilowatt hours in
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
total per month you mean for the entire
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
chart yes oh yeah I was just talking
 
05:29:56.788 --> 05:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
about yeah so so 7% of that $111 that
 
05:29:58.590 --> 05:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
sounds about right I see yeah you went
 
05:30:01.868 --> 05:30:01.878 align:start position:0%
oh you went that way thank you right
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
again non-mathematical mind might be
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
doing it the wrong way representative
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
nter has a question
 
05:30:11.708 --> 05:30:11.718 align:start position:0%
thank you if we didn't have the
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
divesture would the energy cost be less
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
for rate payers
 
05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
today so the goal of divesture was to
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
actually save customers money uh so
 
05:30:27.548 --> 05:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
those uh our Fleet uh our Our Generation
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
portfolio uh was was older um we were
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
seeing that it was less and less we'll
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
say uh competitive with the marketplace
 
05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
and the goal of devest was to
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
essentially remove customers from being
 
05:30:46.470 --> 05:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
um uh required to continue to uh uh
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
invest in those plants and so that was
 
05:30:51.868 --> 05:30:51.878 align:start position:0%
was the goal of
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
it did you have a
 
05:30:57.868 --> 05:30:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
succeed uh so
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
I I'll have to give you a more Fuller
 
05:31:06.510 --> 05:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
answer I know the projections at the
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
time were that it would save customers
 
05:31:13.270 --> 05:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
million representative Corman has a
 
05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:31:18.788 --> 05:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
you both for being here always a
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see both of you um you said
 
05:31:24.190 --> 05:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
that the stranded costs included net
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
metering uh that doesn't include like if
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm an eversource customer and
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
I'm net metering and I'm getting so much
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour I'm putting back onto
 
05:31:33.360 --> 05:31:34.788 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour I'm putting back onto
the

05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
grid that's not coming out of the
 
05:31:39.030 --> 05:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
stranded cost is it what what you're
 
05:31:40.430 --> 05:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
paying me that's not coming out of the
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
stranded costs is it yes that's correct
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
it is we we used to recover that from
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
the default service charge uh but since
 
05:31:52.830 --> 05:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
all customers are eligible to to be uh
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
net metered it's a state program
 
05:31:58.628 --> 05:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
um several years ago it was shifted to
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
the stranded cost recovery charge so the
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
compensation for customers exports flows
 
05:32:05.110 --> 05:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
through the stranded cost recovery
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
charge it is not a stranded cost uh but
 
05:32:10.990 --> 05:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
it is a that is the non- bypassable
 
05:32:15.150 --> 05:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism that uh we utilize to recover
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
to recover those costs followup so it it
 
05:32:22.708 --> 05:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
it's not reflected in just a lower
 
05:32:25.470 --> 05:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
demand uh for electricity that you're
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
buying on the market so reductions in
 
05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
demand associated with uh exports are
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
reflected uh through our load settlement
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
project process so essentially we need
 
05:32:40.110 --> 05:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
too and and I know there's legislation
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
on this uh so it might be better to do a
 
05:32:44.430 --> 05:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
deeper dive at that point uh but
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
essentially we have to account for all
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
the electrons coming into our system uh
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
and so it is accounted for uh through
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
that and any reductions in in that
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:03.670 --> 05:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
customers let's keep moving here great
 
05:33:08.030 --> 05:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so moving on and just taking a a at
 
05:33:09.510 --> 05:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
my watch because I know we have the
 
05:33:12.190 --> 05:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
other utilities uh to go uh this is a
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
very busy slide I'm going to move
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
through it really quickly um
 
05:33:19.708 --> 05:33:19.718 align:start position:0%
so the Investments the the money that we
 
05:33:21.390 --> 05:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
have have spent that we just talked
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
about our rates uh really our our focus
 
05:33:27.788 --> 05:33:27.798 align:start position:0%
is providing reliable and safe uh
 
05:33:31.030 --> 05:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
service to our customers so uh we have
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
seen um significant uh benefits in terms
 
05:33:37.230 --> 05:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
of reliability that our customers are
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
currently uh currently seeing due to
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
those Investments so uh the first chart
 
05:33:45.628 --> 05:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
is uh MBI that's uh months between
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
Interruption and the short answer here
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
is you want a higher number there so you
 
05:33:52.430 --> 05:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
can see the trend line uh that our
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
customers are now uh 18.1 months uh
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
between Interruption that excludes major
 
05:34:01.548 --> 05:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
storms uh the next Slide the next chart
 
05:34:04.510 --> 05:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
is uh is KD that's customer average
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
disruption index uh that really is on a
 
05:34:09.868 --> 05:34:09.878 align:start position:0%
customer basis how long it takes for us
 
05:34:12.990 --> 05:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
to restore you if you do have an average
 
05:34:16.510 --> 05:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
and we want that number to be um uh to
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
be lower so the lower is the better
 
05:34:21.030 --> 05:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
there uh and you can see that's a little
 
05:34:23.310 --> 05:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
bit leveled off but we did have uh make
 
05:34:26.750 --> 05:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
some progress on that um in
 
05:34:30.548 --> 05:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
2024 uh and then the last one sad uh is
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
the the system average disruption index
 
05:34:35.948 --> 05:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
uh and that's really looking at as a
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
system basis the duration of of our
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
outages uh again a lower number here is
 
05:34:44.110 --> 05:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
better uh and you can see a good trend
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
line uh there uh and then the bar chart
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
at the bottom uh each one of those bars
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
represents a year uh and really I I want
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
to call folks attention to um uh the
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
first uh which is showing how many
 
05:35:03.868 --> 05:35:03.878 align:start position:0%
customers when we do have an outage
 
05:35:05.270 --> 05:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're able to
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
restore almost immediately Within 1 to 5
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
minutes so that's without having to roll
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
a truck without having to have a crew on
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
site uh making repairs and 51% of our
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
outages uh last year we were able to
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
restore within five minutes uh and so
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
customers you know might have seen a
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
flicker they might have SE seen a blip
 
05:35:28.830 --> 05:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everyone in the room sorry
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
Griffin uh ex probably experienced that
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
that is you know what we would call uh
 
05:35:36.830 --> 05:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
our smart switches our reclosers the the
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
selfhealing grid where you know a tree
 
05:35:42.868 --> 05:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
branch hits on a line uh and we're able
 
05:35:45.150 --> 05:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
to to the switch will come out but it'll
 
05:35:47.708 --> 05:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
come back in once the branch clears as
 
05:35:49.868 --> 05:35:49.878 align:start position:0%
opposed to the fuse staying out we got
 
05:35:53.430 --> 05:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
to roll a truck so uh really focusing on
 
05:35:56.590 --> 05:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
on customer experience uh and meeting
 
05:35:58.548 --> 05:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
customer expectations which we'll talk
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
about in a minute uh the other uh bar
 
05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
charts at the bottom there uh we want
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
lower because so those are are you know
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
how long it takes for us to resp respond
 
05:36:10.470 --> 05:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we do have to go out uh and make
 
05:36:12.470 --> 05:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
repairs and so obviously we're seeing
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
there representative Corman so uh the
 
05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
the two that are for an with an index I
 
05:36:24.670 --> 05:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know what the index is it's
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
what so so you're looking at um we're
 
05:36:33.070 --> 05:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
talking about minutes uh we're talking
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
about you know in terms of the months um
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be happy to give you a more
 
05:36:41.470 --> 05:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
Fuller explanation of Katie and and safy
 
05:36:44.430 --> 05:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
S excuse me follow up so I mean for for
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
example the the green one the leftmost
 
05:36:49.470 --> 05:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
number is 100.9 that's not minutes
 
05:36:51.868 --> 05:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
that's relative to
 
05:36:54.750 --> 05:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
something I'll defer to I'll be happy to
 
05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
you great okay two more slides awesome
 
05:37:06.270 --> 05:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
um so just oh there we go just to give a
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more insight on onto our
 
05:37:09.788 --> 05:37:09.798 align:start position:0%
restoration process I think Mike queued
 
05:37:11.750 --> 05:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
it up well you know we have eversource
 
05:37:13.350 --> 05:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
has continued to make investments in
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to you know continue to
 
05:37:17.230 --> 05:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
meet growing customer expectations and
 
05:37:19.470 --> 05:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
to ensure the reliability and resiliency
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
of our system even in the face of those
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh major weather events that Mike had
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
referenced um you know when major
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
weather outages occur from weather or
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
other events you know we do have a very
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
robust restoration process that focuses
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
on customer communication and restoring
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
customers as quickly as possible
 
05:37:39.628 --> 05:37:39.638 align:start position:0%
I think the slide you see before you you
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
know there's some text it kind of gives
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
some step byep on how we restore but I
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
just going to focus more on the
 
05:37:47.470 --> 05:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
communication portion of it so you know
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
starting in the committee room here you
 
05:37:52.270 --> 05:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
know we offer regular Communications to
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
State elected officials when major
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
weather events occur so you'll often see
 
05:37:58.190 --> 05:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
an email most likely from Mike or ey you
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
know describing whatever sources planned
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
response will be uh prep work is for a
 
05:38:05.070 --> 05:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
major weather event where things stand
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
as the uh storm progresses and kind of
 
05:38:09.910 --> 05:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
give you some resolution toward uh the
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
end when when everybody else is restored
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
so you know that's an Avenue for you
 
05:38:15.548 --> 05:38:15.558 align:start position:0%
folks if there's something that comes up
 
05:38:16.708 --> 05:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
in your neck of the woods you really
 
05:38:19.110 --> 05:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
need to you know communicate with us
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
Mike and I are you guys you know feel
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
free to reach out to us there um going
 
05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
down to your local communities you know
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
before storms occur a lot of our
 
05:38:29.310 --> 05:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
community Liaisons work directly with
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal officials to identify
 
05:38:33.270 --> 05:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
important local infrastructure that is a
 
05:38:34.628 --> 05:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
priority for that community so it could
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
be a senior living facility a fire
 
05:38:39.150 --> 05:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
department or I'm sorry a fire station a
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
police station those types of things um
 
05:38:42.910 --> 05:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
to really identify those as the
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
important local infrastructure resources
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
for a community as well as to identify
 
05:38:49.628 --> 05:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
important contacts when uh emergencies
 
05:38:51.230 --> 05:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
occur you know whether that's a Town
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
Administrator a mayor a road agent Etc
 
05:38:57.190 --> 05:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
um so we work very closely with that uh
 
05:38:59.230 --> 05:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
we also offer training with local
 
05:39:02.110 --> 05:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
officials with our staff to to learn
 
05:39:03.868 --> 05:39:03.878 align:start position:0%
what to do in the event of an outage if
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
say a wire goes down a pole is broken
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
those types of things we also uh created
 
05:39:11.548 --> 05:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
and run a portal for municipal officials
 
05:39:14.070 --> 05:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
called the munih Hub um this is a portal
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
that Municipal officials can use to
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
directly interact with us and report a
 
05:39:20.030 --> 05:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
priority issue so that it gets to the
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
top of our list and we can address it as
 
05:39:24.270 --> 05:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible um moving on you
 
05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
know a little bit further down to um
 
05:39:29.270 --> 05:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
residential customers you know we notify
 
05:39:31.070 --> 05:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
them regularly through email and text
 
05:39:33.270 --> 05:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
Communications when outages occur we
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
encourage them to communicate with us
 
05:39:36.990 --> 05:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
you know if issues arise if a poll goes
 
05:39:38.948 --> 05:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
down near their house if there's a wire
 
05:39:40.948 --> 05:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
down that type of thing and give them
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
estimated times for uh restoration so
 
05:39:46.230 --> 05:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
with that I think it's a good uh segue
 
05:39:48.510 --> 05:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
into you know frequent and more historic
 
05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
storms that we're seeing so I'll kick
 
05:39:52.270 --> 05:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
that back over the mic thanks Griffin
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
and this is our our last slide and uh
 
05:39:58.310 --> 05:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
really what we wanted to show here was
 
05:40:02.190 --> 05:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
um The increased frequency and severity
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
of the storms uh quite frankly that
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
we're encountering uh on an annual basis
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
and is you can see this is uh data that
 
05:40:11.430 --> 05:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
we uh that we pulled from the New
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy of the
 
05:40:16.270 --> 05:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
the top 10 storms uh most impactful
 
05:40:19.948 --> 05:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
storms uh up until uh last year the ice
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
storm in '08 which I'm sure many of us
 
05:40:24.430 --> 05:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
remember was number one uh the spring
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
nor Easter last year which dumped uh
 
05:40:29.868 --> 05:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
very very heavy wet snow on the central
 
05:40:32.430 --> 05:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
part of the State uh eclipsed that uh so
 
05:40:34.948 --> 05:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
that is now we have a new number one uh
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen really over the past uh two
 
05:40:41.230 --> 05:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
years uh for storms that are now in the
 
05:40:43.548 --> 05:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
top 10 and have moved other storms down
 
05:40:46.468 --> 05:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
and so um you know these are very
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
challenging storms they're extremely
 
05:40:51.788 --> 05:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
damaging uh to our our system and I
 
05:40:54.910 --> 05:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
would just say the the backdrop uh or
 
05:40:57.708 --> 05:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
the challenge we face as a utility is
 
05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
increasing customer expectations for us
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
to get the power back on um so again
 
05:41:06.110 --> 05:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
that spring nor Easter uh we were able
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
to get uh substantial restoration within
 
05:41:11.910 --> 05:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
4 days uh and we had the you know solar
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
eclipse uh that you know a day later and
 
05:41:17.230 --> 05:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of pressure to to get
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
that done because a lot of people were
 
05:41:21.390 --> 05:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
coming up north uh to view that you know
 
05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
compared to the 2008 I storm which took
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
14 days uh I I think if uh you know we
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
went 14 days uh now people would be
 
05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
lining up with torches outside of of
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
energy Park uh so the backdrop is you
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
know really increasing customer
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
expectations that the lights will come
 
05:41:42.350 --> 05:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
back on quicker while we're seeing these
 
05:41:45.070 --> 05:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
more frequent more damaging uh storms
 
05:41:47.868 --> 05:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
that we have to deal with so that's a
 
05:41:51.590 --> 05:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
16-year period that this table covers
 
05:41:54.468 --> 05:41:54.478 align:start position:0%
and uh what period did you compare that
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
to to come up with the conclusion that
 
05:41:57.868 --> 05:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
there were more frequent and more
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
damaging storms so this data is again
 
05:42:04.270 --> 05:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
 
05:42:07.590 --> 05:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
energy uh I believe they go back further
 
05:42:10.628 --> 05:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's just that the top 10 stops in
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
2012 uh it's data obviously they get
 
05:42:18.868 --> 05:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
from the utilities and uh our our view
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh is that we have had four of the top
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
10 most damaging storms uh in the past
 
05:42:28.350 --> 05:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
two years uh we you know continue to see
 
05:42:30.590 --> 05:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh an increase in these uh
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
events okay thank you so we have roughly
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
40 minutes left is we have a hard stop
 
05:42:38.878 --> 05:42:40.390 align:start position:0%
40 minutes left is we have a hard stop
at

05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
3:30 and uh so 40 minutes divided by
 
05:42:47.230 --> 05:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
three more utilities that's going to
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
give uh each of you about no more than
 
05:42:54.350 --> 05:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
20 minutes right 15 minutes yeah let's
 
05:42:56.590 --> 05:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
say 15 minutes
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
so as a public service announcement if
 
05:43:02.548 --> 05:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
there is anybody in the room who plans
 
05:43:05.468 --> 05:43:05.478 align:start position:0%
to testify at the public hearing of
 
05:43:09.868 --> 05:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 106 at 3 3:30 please visit
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
the table under the clock by the door
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
over there and get a pink card fill that
 
05:43:18.830 --> 05:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
out and pass it up my
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
way um and now we can return to our
 
05:43:24.830 --> 05:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
regularly schedule
 
05:43:27.430 --> 05:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
program thank you all okay thank you
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%

05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
well as our community giving uh I have

been with Unitil for a number of years
 
05:44:08.310 --> 05:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
though I'm new to this particular room
 
05:44:10.670 --> 05:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
you may have seen me as part of my uh
 
05:44:12.670 --> 05:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
media relations responsibilities as I've

front for a number of years and have
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
often been the front person with a
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
number of our storms and when we've had
 
05:44:22.150 --> 05:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
storm modes I've been the Chief
 
05:44:24.510 --> 05:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
Information officer on second shifts
 
05:44:26.708 --> 05:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
ensuring that good information gets out
 
05:44:28.990 --> 05:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
to all of our stakeholders including
 
05:44:30.750 --> 05:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
yourselves what I'm going to talk about
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit today I'm going to give you
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
a high level overview of Unitil I'm also
 
05:44:36.468 --> 05:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
going to get into some of the same
 
05:44:38.070 --> 05:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
things that that Mike and Griffin talked
 
05:44:40.830 --> 05:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
about in terms of Bill components and
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
storm response but I'm going to talk
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
about those a little bit more from the
 
05:44:47.070 --> 05:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
perspective of the customer and how we
 
05:44:49.230 --> 05:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
communicate some of the thorniest pieces
 
05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
of both of those topics we recognize
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that those are sort of topics number one
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
and number two for many of our customers
 
05:44:57.030 --> 05:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure they have good
 
05:44:58.510 --> 05:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
understanding on those so I'm going to
 
05:45:01.750 --> 05:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
get into a little bit about what that
 
05:45:04.670 --> 05:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
means as for Unitil itself this is our
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
footprint in New Hampshire we have
 
05:45:09.270 --> 05:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
approximate 78,000 electric customers
 
05:45:12.628 --> 05:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
and 37,000 natural gas customers Unitil
 
05:45:16.110 --> 05:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
is a natural gas and electric utility we
 
05:45:18.110 --> 05:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
serve three states in New England we
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
have about half of our total customers
 
05:45:21.868 --> 05:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire our
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
headquarters is here in New Hampshire in
 
05:45:26.350 --> 05:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
fact Unitil I believe is the only
 
05:45:27.708 --> 05:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
publicly traded company that is
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
incorporated here in New Hampshire which
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
is something that is a small point of
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
Pride for us our electric service is in
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
two non-contiguous territories in the
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
state we serve the greater conquered
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
area with our head of operations in
 
05:45:43.110 --> 05:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
conquered in the city itself as well as
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
our call center that serves all of our
 
05:45:47.150 --> 05:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
operations we have our corporate
 
05:45:49.468 --> 05:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
headquarters in Hampton New Hampshire
 
05:45:51.548 --> 05:45:51.558 align:start position:0%
all of our Natural Gas Service runs
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
along the coastal area it kind of runs
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
around the horn of the southeast state
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
line all the way from Salem kind of up
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
around the corner and up Route 16 to
 
05:46:04.110 --> 05:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh our second electric service
 
05:46:06.270 --> 05:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
territory is in the Sea Coast area as
 
05:46:09.310 --> 05:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
well you can see uh the lined area is
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
where gas and electric service overlaps
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's the Hampton exitor down into
 
05:46:17.948 --> 05:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
Atkinson plastow area if we were to zoom
 
05:46:20.270 --> 05:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
out from this you would see that we have
 
05:46:22.990 --> 05:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh gas and electric service in north
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
central Massachusetts as well covering
 
05:46:27.150 --> 05:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
about six towns there and we have
 
05:46:28.910 --> 05:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
natural gas service that runs up the
 
05:46:30.548 --> 05:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
coast in Maine all the way up to
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
Portland then juts North up into the
 
05:46:35.670 --> 05:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
Leon Atkinson area uh significant piece
 
05:46:38.070 --> 05:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
of news for Unitil is that last year we
 
05:46:39.948 --> 05:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
did announce plans to purchase Bangor
 
05:46:41.590 --> 05:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
natural gas which would increase our
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
total natural gas uh customer base by
 
05:46:47.070 --> 05:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 8,000 more customers in
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine that would bring us
 
05:46:51.708 --> 05:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
about all total to about 108,000
 
05:46:55.510 --> 05:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
electric customers and about 88,000 uh
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
customers if you were to go to any of
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
our operations centers you'd find this
 
05:47:06.430 --> 05:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
big blue wall in just about any of them
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
this wall represents our mission vision
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
and values I know the folks from ISO New
 
05:47:13.628 --> 05:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
England mentioned they have a vision and
 
05:47:16.350 --> 05:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
mission two separate statements as well
 
05:47:18.670 --> 05:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
um ours did not have to be approved by
 
05:47:20.750 --> 05:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
FK for which I am thankful but we were
 
05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
able to kind of have the same dichotomy
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
that they were talking about our mission
 
05:47:26.990 --> 05:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
represents what we have to do every day
 
05:47:29.310 --> 05:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
to serve our customers we know that
 
05:47:30.868 --> 05:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
every day when we get up in the morning
 
05:47:32.070 --> 05:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we're
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
providing that electric service it needs
 
05:47:35.430 --> 05:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
to be done safely and reliably and we
 
05:47:38.350 --> 05:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
need to do that in an afford able manner
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
without doing that we really can't do
 
05:47:42.310 --> 05:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
much of anything else so we know we have
 
05:47:44.190 --> 05:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
to have the mission taken care of every
 
05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
day before we can look at the vision at
 
05:47:47.548 --> 05:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
the same time you have to have a vision
 
05:47:48.548 --> 05:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
you have to know where you're going to
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
be going and our vision is all about
 
05:47:52.750 --> 05:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our customers have the
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
resources they need they need to know
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
they have their evolving energy needs
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
met and what do we mean by that we know
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
that as we've gone forward there are
 
05:48:03.510 --> 05:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
folks using energy in increasingly
 
05:48:05.190 --> 05:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
diverse ways we have a number of
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
customers that are interested in using
 
05:48:10.510 --> 05:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know in terms of rooftop solar
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
what does that mean making sure we have
 
05:48:14.070 --> 05:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
a two-way system that accommodates that
 
05:48:16.150 --> 05:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
making sure we have the rate structures
 
05:48:17.628 --> 05:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
that are going to be accommodating a
 
05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
variety of different uses time of use
 
05:48:21.548 --> 05:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
rates folks looking at electric vehicles
 
05:48:23.030 --> 05:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
these are all things we're constantly
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
looking at and ensuring we're going to
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
be incorporating them into our system in
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
a manner that still ensures that we're
 
05:48:31.390 --> 05:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
meeting that mission which means that
 
05:48:34.110 --> 05:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
energy remains affordable for all and
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
reliable for all
 
05:48:39.070 --> 05:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
we kind of measure that by looking at
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
customer service and when we talk about
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
customer service we're not just talking
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
about our call center we know that
 
05:48:46.830 --> 05:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
customer service represents basically
 
05:48:48.990 --> 05:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
all touch points that our customers have
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
with us as we're providing them service
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
that includes what we're doing during
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
storms how we're communicating with them
 
05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
across all of those channels making sure
 
05:49:00.270 --> 05:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
anybody that that person is talking to
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
is getting that experience we need and
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
we measure that through a third party
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
service and currently as part of our
 
05:49:08.788 --> 05:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
2024 results of that third-party survey
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
we have a 90% overall customer service
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
rating with our customers which
 
05:49:14.948 --> 05:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
represents first overall in the Eastern
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
us and in the Northeast generally
 
05:49:19.310 --> 05:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
speaking they separate out East versus
 
05:49:21.030 --> 05:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
West and Northeast versus the rest of
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
the company country rather because we
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
have unique challenges in the East and
 
05:49:27.868 --> 05:49:27.878 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast this is typically areas
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the country where you have more
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
severe storms constantly occurring
 
05:49:33.230 --> 05:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that can impact uh
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
overall customer experience as well as
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
of course affordability those are two
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
factors which is why highlighting those
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
specific areas is important uh we look
 
05:49:44.350 --> 05:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
past that and we want to see where on
 
05:49:47.070 --> 05:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
terms of customer service and surveying
 
05:49:48.190 --> 05:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
what are the areas that we're
 
05:49:50.070 --> 05:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
highlighting and and we like the things
 
05:49:51.628 --> 05:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing as part of that the
 
05:49:54.430 --> 05:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
areas where we seem to be uh among the
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
top of our peers involves things like uh
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
are we reliable uh do our customers find
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
that we're knowledgeable are we
 
05:50:03.788 --> 05:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
presenting that information in a
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
friendly way that's sort of the key
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
basis of
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay we we're doing something correct
 
05:50:11.070 --> 05:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
here in terms of how we're informing our
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
customers and making sure they're
 
05:50:15.468 --> 05:50:15.478 align:start position:0%
understanding these complex topics
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
because energy is an incredibly complex
 
05:50:19.350 --> 05:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
thing some folks just want to know that
 
05:50:20.830 --> 05:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
their power is going to be on and and
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
when that's going to happen and how they
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
can pay their bills some people want to
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
understand why you know why what's going
 
05:50:27.990 --> 05:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
on with Supply costs why are they going
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
up right now why are they coming down
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
right now what are my options in terms
 
05:50:33.390 --> 05:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
of suppliers we try and build all of our
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
Communications to make sure we're doing
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
a good job of explaining and informing
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
these particular topics so in terms of
 
05:50:42.670 --> 05:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
our bill uh I know that Mike and Griffin
 
05:50:45.150 --> 05:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
had a very similar uh slide to this
 
05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
these are in fact the breakdown of the
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
terms on the Unitil Bill itself I did a
 
05:50:51.750 --> 05:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
quick text to make sure I knew exactly
 
05:50:53.548 --> 05:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
where it was the delivery charge
 
05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
specifically the external delivery
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
charge is where net metering uh
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
so-called additional costs and credits
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's where they live within the Unitil
 
05:51:01.830 --> 05:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill I made a quick check with our
 
05:51:04.430 --> 05:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory folks to confirm that so that
 
05:51:07.390 --> 05:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
is where that lives um in terms of the
 
05:51:09.468 --> 05:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
overall Bill understanding these
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
different components specifically
 
05:51:12.868 --> 05:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
understanding the difference between
 
05:51:15.150 --> 05:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
Supply and distribution because Unitil
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
is just a distribution company is at the
 
05:51:19.390 --> 05:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
Forefront of many of our our
 
05:51:21.510 --> 05:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
Communications with customers we ended
 
05:51:24.190 --> 05:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
up really in the two approximately two
 
05:51:26.708 --> 05:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
years ago I think is when we saw that
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
very significant Spike across supply
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
cost throughout uh the entirety of New
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
England and New Hampshire specifically
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we saw that coming as part probably
 
05:51:37.708 --> 05:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
about in that summer we were getting
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
indicators that we were potentially
 
05:51:40.510 --> 05:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing very high Supply
 
05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
rates for that coming winter so we
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
looked at how can we use our existing
 
05:51:47.390 --> 05:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
tools to make sure customers understood
 
05:51:49.510 --> 05:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
what was going on with Supply costs but
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
also what options were available to them
 
05:51:54.510 --> 05:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of supply cost as we know all
 
05:51:56.110 --> 05:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
customers have the option to sort of
 
05:51:58.390 --> 05:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
become their own broker uh Community
 
05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
aggregation hadn't quite cut on yet in
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as it had now
 
05:52:03.150 --> 05:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
but there were still a number of
 
05:52:04.830 --> 05:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
suppliers that were available to our
 
05:52:06.910 --> 05:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
customers so we had to make sure how are
 
05:52:08.990 --> 05:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
we able to convey to our customers that
 
05:52:11.270 --> 05:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
these options were available to them and
 
05:52:12.910 --> 05:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
that they were not competitors with
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
Unitil I think that was a huge uh
 
05:52:16.670 --> 05:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
question mark that we had for a lot of
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
us so yes we're able to do some of that
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
through media it was certainly a big
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Topic at the time we were answering
 
05:52:24.030 --> 05:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
those questions as they came in but we
 
05:52:26.190 --> 05:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
were able to use our website to build
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
out resources that allowed you know just
 
05:52:30.510 --> 05:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
basically what is supply how do you get
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
it where are the suppliers that are
 
05:52:34.030 --> 05:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
available what are the sort of things
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
that you need to think about if you're
 
05:52:37.310 --> 05:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
looking at one of these contractors just
 
05:52:39.310 --> 05:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
like any other long-term contract that a
 
05:52:40.670 --> 05:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
person might be interested in getting
 
05:52:42.270 --> 05:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
into you want to make sure you know what
 
05:52:44.190 --> 05:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
the fine print are how long does it last
 
05:52:45.548 --> 05:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
what happens if you want to get out of
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
it these were the kinds of communication
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
points that we were trying to bring out
 
05:52:51.430 --> 05:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
on this particular Topic at the time and
 
05:52:53.390 --> 05:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
we found that very helpful going forward
 
05:52:56.750 --> 05:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
so as we've continued to see Supply be a
 
05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
a point of emphasis among our customer
 
05:53:01.948 --> 05:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
base we've kind of built this resource
 
05:53:03.788 --> 05:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
and this toolkit to be able to talk
 
05:53:07.390 --> 05:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
about these things on the Storm side uh
 
05:53:09.070 --> 05:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
we have a very similar structure as to
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
what eversource was talking about we use
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
the incident command system in our uh
 
05:53:15.788 --> 05:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
company that's why I have my storm role
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
which has historically been Chief
 
05:53:19.390 --> 05:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
Information officer I'm going to take on
 
05:53:21.350 --> 05:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
a more specialized role going forward
 
05:53:23.190 --> 05:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be working specifically
 
05:53:25.230 --> 05:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
with our our liaison and elected
 
05:53:26.750 --> 05:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
officials making sure you get good
 
05:53:28.948 --> 05:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
information in terms of what's going on
 
05:53:31.708 --> 05:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
on our overall system but uh everyone in
 
05:53:33.270 --> 05:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
the company has a storm roll our our
 
05:53:34.750 --> 05:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
folks in accounting they make sure you
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
know they'll go out and they'll on our
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
drills they'll practice getting cones
 
05:53:40.350 --> 05:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
down making sure our staging areas are
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
going to be managed in terms of traffic
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're you know about 500 employees all
 
05:53:47.590 --> 05:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
together about 390 of which are here in
 
05:53:49.430 --> 05:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so when we have a big
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
event come through we use all of our
 
05:53:52.390 --> 05:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
hands to make sure we're helping our
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
customers and get that done uh the
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
number one question that we get as a
 
05:53:58.910 --> 05:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
storm rolls through generally as I
 
05:54:00.750 --> 05:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
assume everyone here would know it would
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
be when is that power coming back on
 
05:54:05.230 --> 05:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
more importantly why can't you tell me
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
when the power is coming back on yet
 
05:54:10.070 --> 05:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
often times in the first you know 12 to
 
05:54:12.430 --> 05:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
24 hours of these storms that people
 
05:54:14.430 --> 05:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
want to know well when is it coming on
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you say well we're still assessing
 
05:54:17.590 --> 05:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
that damage and then the obvious
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is is well what does
 
05:54:20.750 --> 05:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
assessing mean what does that mean
 
05:54:22.708 --> 05:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
you're doing and what it means is quite
 
05:54:24.270 --> 05:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
literally we're assessing sometimes that
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
means that the storm isn't even over yet
 
05:54:28.390 --> 05:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh we'll get questions about when we're
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
going to restore power within the first
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
hour 90 minutes of a storm that maybe
 
05:54:34.990 --> 05:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
has just begun and we're expecting
 
05:54:37.868 --> 05:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
hazardous conditions for another 12 to
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
18 hours that's not uncommon especially
 
05:54:42.030 --> 05:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
with high wind events where it might
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
knock power out very very quickly but we
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
know there's going to be issues that
 
05:54:47.030 --> 05:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're not even going to know what the
 
05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
extent of the damage is for another 12
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
18 hours so that's one of the things we
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
know we need to communicate to our
 
05:54:55.390 --> 05:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
customers once we know that the storm is
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
passed and we know all the damage that
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to see is complete that's
 
05:55:00.590 --> 05:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
when our operations folks begin the
 
05:55:02.310 --> 05:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
process of trying to figure out exactly
 
05:55:04.430 --> 05:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
how much damage there is on the system
 
05:55:06.030 --> 05:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
as a whole they're taking all those
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
different things every broken Pole every
 
05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
Transformer that's going to need getting
 
05:55:12.030 --> 05:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
fixed every single wires down issue
 
05:55:13.390 --> 05:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
that's out there we're able to take a
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
look once we're able to get our arms
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
around all the damage that's out there
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
we can figure out the man hours of work
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
that needs to get done and then we can
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
divide that by the number of Crews that
 
05:55:24.670 --> 05:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
we have available once you get to that
 
05:55:26.468 --> 05:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
point it's a very simple math equation
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's just simply man-hours versus
 
05:55:30.190 --> 05:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
workers that you have to do the job but
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
that takes time to get done and that's
 
05:55:34.030 --> 05:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
why we wait and we say we're assessing
 
05:55:35.788 --> 05:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
the damage before we're able to provide
 
05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
that global estimated restoration time
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure we have that work
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
complete we have a clear picture of the
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
total damage on the system and then once
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
we have that information we're able to
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
share when we're going to be able to get
 
05:55:49.390 --> 05:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
power restored at that time uh over the
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
past several events we've had uh a nice
 
05:55:53.390 --> 05:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
combination of good planning and good
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
fortune I think in the past 2 three
 
05:55:57.468 --> 05:55:57.478 align:start position:0%
years uh We've managed to restore power
 
05:56:00.548 --> 05:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
to about 99% of our customers from Peak
 
05:56:03.070 --> 05:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
about either 48 or 72 hours from the
 
05:56:07.788 --> 05:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
so while we're managing that mission we
 
05:56:11.788 --> 05:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
know we have that Vision work to do as
 
05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
well and I have a picture here from our
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking ceremony and I see a
 
05:56:17.230 --> 05:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
couple folks that were here that I got
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
to meet uh at that particular event that
 
05:56:22.510 --> 05:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
was a major event for us as a company uh
 
05:56:24.750 --> 05:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
for those that may not be aware here uh
 
05:56:27.150 --> 05:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
we officially broke ground last year on
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
the first utility owned solar array in
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire once it's
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
complete later this year it will be
 
05:56:36.030 --> 05:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
among the largest uh arrays of its kind
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
in in the state if not the largest at
 
05:56:40.590 --> 05:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 5 megaw uh we're able to
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
build that through a statute in the
 
05:56:44.990 --> 05:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
state that says that a utility May build
 
05:56:47.150 --> 05:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
distributed generation of approximately
 
05:56:49.708 --> 05:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
6% of its peak load for Unitil that
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
rounds up to about 18 megawatts this is
 
05:56:54.948 --> 05:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
5 megaw uh we gained approval and we're
 
05:56:56.590 --> 05:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
able to build construction and I think
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
the key point I want to make on a
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
project like this is Unitil believes in
 
05:57:03.150 --> 05:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
finding these types of solutions and
 
05:57:05.110 --> 05:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
going forward them with them when we're
 
05:57:08.230 --> 05:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
able to uh clearly identify the cost
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
benefits to our customers as part of the
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
building of this solar array we were
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
able to prove to the Department of
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
energy that the net effect for our
 
05:57:17.910 --> 05:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
customers in terms of building this
 
05:57:19.868 --> 05:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
array and the energy would produce would
 
05:57:22.590 --> 05:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
in fact be an offset decrease to our
 
05:57:24.788 --> 05:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
customers over time that's why we
 
05:57:26.190 --> 05:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
pursued this and that's why we're able
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
to build it and as it gets complete and
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
we get that data come in that proves
 
05:57:32.628 --> 05:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
that out uh we would be more than
 
05:57:34.230 --> 05:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
excited to be able to continue to pursue
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
that forward but first we want to see
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
that data come in and confirm what we've
 
05:57:39.310 --> 05:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
been sharing before we pursue another
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
array like this um outside of that it's
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
about our customers and figuring out
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
what we can do for them we know our
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
customers want to make sure they have
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
rates that make sense we have time of
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
use rates and EV rates our Energy
 
05:57:52.070 --> 05:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs are tremendous
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
resource for our customers to be able to
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
keep energy affordable for them and we
 
05:57:58.590 --> 05:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're we're just
 
05:58:01.430 --> 05:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
keeping our system up to speed as folks
 
05:58:03.948 --> 05:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
look for these new things as more load
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
comes onto the system as folks explore
 
05:58:08.270 --> 05:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
alternative sources for heating or
 
05:58:10.468 --> 05:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
electrification or electric vehicles we
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
need to make sure our infrastructure is
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
keeping up so that's what our
 
05:58:14.510 --> 05:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
engineering team is working on they want
 
05:58:15.788 --> 05:58:15.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're continuing to
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
maintain that
 
05:58:20.190 --> 05:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
pace finally as both a gas and electric
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
utility we represent and recognize that
 
05:58:26.190 --> 05:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
gas has a clear role to play as part of
 
05:58:28.708 --> 05:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
New England's overall energy structure
 
05:58:30.830 --> 05:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh Natural Gas Service uh in New
 
05:58:33.070 --> 05:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are cast iron free we
 
05:58:34.708 --> 05:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
have no cast iron pipe that
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
differentiates our system from those in
 
05:58:39.230 --> 05:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Connecticut or other
 
05:58:41.468 --> 05:58:41.478 align:start position:0%
areas uh that still have cast iron that
 
05:58:42.670 --> 05:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
they're working to remove from our
 
05:58:44.390 --> 05:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
system that means our system is among
 
05:58:46.628 --> 05:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
the tightest in the region uh We've made
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
a commitment as a company to reduce our
 
05:58:50.750 --> 05:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
scope one emissions that is emissions
 
05:58:53.430 --> 05:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
that are released to Atmosphere as part
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
of our overall gas operations to reduce
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
those by 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050
 
05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
did I say 2030 that's not a real date
 
05:59:06.750 --> 05:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
2030 and 2050 uh we're going to go about
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
that not only because we have that work
 
05:59:10.750 --> 05:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
going done on our overall infrastructure
 
05:59:13.430 --> 05:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
and get rid of cast iron but also we're
 
05:59:15.150 --> 05:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
continuing to move forward from that
 
05:59:17.190 --> 05:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing Advanced Leak Detection this
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
is not the standard Leak Detection
 
05:59:20.468 --> 05:59:20.478 align:start position:0%
that's looking for leaks on a safety
 
05:59:22.390 --> 05:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
purpose this is Advanced looking at
 
05:59:24.510 --> 05:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
parts per billion as opposed to parts
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
per million what we're looking to do
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
there is identify these points in the
 
05:59:30.670 --> 05:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
gas system that are simply releasing gas
 
05:59:32.510 --> 05:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
that are never a safety concern but are
 
05:59:34.430 --> 05:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
where emissions are going out we want to
 
05:59:36.590 --> 05:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
make sure we're getting in in advanced
 
05:59:39.670 --> 05:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
in front of those but also because we
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
discovered as we're going through in our
 
05:59:44.150 --> 05:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
sustainability reports the EPA expects
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
that when you're reporting Emissions on
 
05:59:48.030 --> 05:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
your gas system as a whole you're taking
 
05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh miles per pipe and the kind of pipe
 
05:59:52.750 --> 05:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
that is and simply doing a rithmetic on
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
that in other words there's an
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
expectation that if you have X miles of
 
05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
pipe it's going to have this amount of
 
05:59:59.788 --> 05:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
leaks we want to prove that out that's
 
06:00:01.070 --> 06:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
why we're doing this work so we're
 
06:00:03.190 --> 06:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
getting that proactive pipe work done
 
06:00:04.708 --> 06:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
and what we're finding is our actual
 
06:00:07.230 --> 06:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
Emissions on systems are below that of
 
06:00:09.270 --> 06:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
the expectations in the EPA so we're
 
06:00:11.070 --> 06:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
able to not only prove that but then
 
06:00:12.670 --> 06:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to Target these leaks and
 
06:00:14.670 --> 06:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
then be able to continue to do repairs
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's part of how we're getting
 
06:00:17.750 --> 06:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves to
 
06:00:20.628 --> 06:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
zero so that's Unitil in a nutshell I
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
look forward to working with all of you
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
06:00:26.788 --> 06:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
got I know I have limited time but how
 
06:00:28.270 --> 06:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
can I help thank you very much
 
06:00:30.670 --> 06:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
06:00:31.990 --> 06:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh quick two-part
 
06:00:36.270 --> 06:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
question my first one has to do with my
 
06:00:38.788 --> 06:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
constituents I I represent uh three
 
06:00:40.670 --> 06:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
towns that are in your district there of
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh plastow Newton and Southampton and I
 
06:00:45.230 --> 06:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
know we all receive and all my
 
06:00:46.750 --> 06:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
constituents at least for distribution
 
06:00:49.310 --> 06:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
receive a bill from Unitil uh however
 
06:00:51.468 --> 06:00:51.478 align:start position:0%
with natural gas I notice where natural
 
06:00:54.670 --> 06:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
gas is in plastow I was curious to why
 
06:00:57.270 --> 06:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
it goes around Newton and Southampton
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's my first part of the question yep
 
06:01:00.750 --> 06:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
and the second second part of my
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
question is with the 5 megawatt solar
 
06:01:05.468 --> 06:01:05.478 align:start position:0%
farm you built next door in Kingston uh
 
06:01:07.510 --> 06:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
how many Acres of grounded that take up
 
06:01:10.190 --> 06:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
to build that for the site I knew that
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head when we
 
06:01:14.190 --> 06:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
were at the groundbreaking I'm going to
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
say it's approximately 30 Acres I can
 
06:01:17.708 --> 06:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
get you the specific number of that
 
06:01:20.110 --> 06:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
particular area um I don't recall if
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
that's the number of the land itself or
 
06:01:24.070 --> 06:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
if it's the fenced in area for the array
 
06:01:25.548 --> 06:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
but I can get the number correctly but I
 
06:01:27.830 --> 06:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
know that that's a good ballpark for you
 
06:01:29.390 --> 06:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
um in terms of natural gas
 
06:01:32.310 --> 06:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as a whole uh Unitil has
 
06:01:35.468 --> 06:01:35.478 align:start position:0%
a a very uh pragmatic conservative
 
06:01:37.750 --> 06:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
approach to Natural Gas expansion
 
06:01:39.788 --> 06:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
generally speaking natural gas expansion
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
is something that happens uh one street
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
and one neighborhood at a time you look
 
06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
at where the overall your backbone of
 
06:01:48.628 --> 06:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
your system is your core pipelines your
 
06:01:50.948 --> 06:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
Mains and then you try and see what
 
06:01:53.030 --> 06:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
customers may be interested in that
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have a large anchor
 
06:01:56.468 --> 06:01:56.478 align:start position:0%
customer that's a little bit further
 
06:01:58.590 --> 06:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
away from that Main and then you look to
 
06:02:01.510 --> 06:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
try and if that customer is interested
 
06:02:02.868 --> 06:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
that means that there's a potential
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to be able to bring
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
on Natural Gas customer between there
 
06:02:09.590 --> 06:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
and all the way along the line uh Unitil
 
06:02:11.468 --> 06:02:11.478 align:start position:0%
does expand its natural gas service I
 
06:02:13.708 --> 06:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
believe them our most our newest town in
 
06:02:16.468 --> 06:02:16.478 align:start position:0%
the system is eping New Hampshire uh we
 
06:02:18.190 --> 06:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
expanded to eping I believe within the
 
06:02:21.468 --> 06:02:21.478 align:start position:0%
last 5 years um and it's a matter of
 
06:02:23.708 --> 06:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
finding the right opportunity uh and
 
06:02:25.590 --> 06:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
having the numbers work out and having a
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
strong interest within a specific
 
06:02:28.750 --> 06:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
community and having the pipeline that
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
can be able to serve it but it's a lot
 
06:02:32.390 --> 06:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
of different individual pieces that lead
 
06:02:35.468 --> 06:02:35.478 align:start position:0%
to a specific new expansion to an area
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
are General expansion philosophy is
 
06:02:39.510 --> 06:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
looking within our existing system and
 
06:02:41.548 --> 06:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
finding folks that may still be on
 
06:02:43.110 --> 06:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
delivered fuels of which there are
 
06:02:45.310 --> 06:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
several close to our Mains and bringing
 
06:02:46.830 --> 06:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
those folks online as well we see
 
06:02:49.110 --> 06:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities to not only uh reduce
 
06:02:50.910 --> 06:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
their energy costs but reduce emissions
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
as well for those particular
 
06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
customers I'd remind members we have 28
 
06:02:58.230 --> 06:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
minutes left and we have two utilities
 
06:03:00.628 --> 06:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
to hear from
 
06:03:04.230 --> 06:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
so representative schneller thank you Mr
 
06:03:06.110 --> 06:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
chairman real quick I was just wondering
 
06:03:08.270 --> 06:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
where do you Source your natural gas it
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
might have been on the map but I missed
 
06:03:12.390 --> 06:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
it so we have um our natural gas comes
 
06:03:15.548 --> 06:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
in you know we're at the same issues uh
 
06:03:17.150 --> 06:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
as the rest of New England in terms of
 
06:03:19.070 --> 06:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the pipelines that serve New England as
 
06:03:22.150 --> 06:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
a whole um we tie into the Tennessee gas
 
06:03:24.590 --> 06:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline our system also ties into the
 
06:03:26.670 --> 06:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
Portland maritimes pipeline that comes
 
06:03:28.990 --> 06:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
in from the north so there is gas
 
06:03:31.230 --> 06:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
service available to us from the south
 
06:03:34.030 --> 06:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
and from the north but um our gas
 
06:03:36.190 --> 06:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
service is faces the same pipeline
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
constraints is the rest of New England
 
06:03:38.120 --> 06:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
constraints is the rest of New England
thank

06:03:39.750 --> 06:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
you all right I want to thank you very
 
06:03:45.110 --> 06:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
much and next call on Liberty Utilities
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
to give us a
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
presentation and I apologize for the
 
06:03:50.390 --> 06:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
fact that you're going to have to be
 
06:03:53.548 --> 06:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
quick but that's just the way um things
 
06:03:56.270 --> 06:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
have evolved
 
06:03:56.280 --> 06:03:58.788 align:start position:0%
have evolved
here

06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
yeah drag another chair up if you need
 
06:04:01.320 --> 06:04:07.070 align:start position:0%
yeah drag another chair up if you need
to

06:04:07.070 --> 06:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:13.270 --> 06:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
good good
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone so my name is Carolyn
 
06:04:20.110 --> 06:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
' Conor and I am the director of
 
06:04:22.430 --> 06:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
government Affairs for Liberty Utilities
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I also play that role
 
06:04:29.310 --> 06:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
for Liberty's east region which I can
 
06:04:32.310 --> 06:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
explain or tell you at another time I am
 
06:04:34.990 --> 06:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
aided in New Hampshire by jod grimus
 
06:04:36.190 --> 06:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
who's here
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh who I think many of you know so she's
 
06:04:41.310 --> 06:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
our lobbyist and our government Affairs
 
06:04:43.868 --> 06:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
consultant and support so she's here on
 
06:04:46.390 --> 06:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
a regular basis we talk on a daily basis
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
so anything I know this is going to be
 
06:04:50.468 --> 06:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
short anything that's needed any
 
06:04:53.070 --> 06:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
questions that come up you can contact
 
06:04:54.910 --> 06:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
me directly I'll provide the committee
 
06:04:56.990 --> 06:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
with my contact information or you can
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
get to Jody very quickly and we can um
 
06:05:02.230 --> 06:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
respond to any questions or information
 
06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
that you
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
need so uh I'm joined joed today by two
 
06:05:10.350 --> 06:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
leaders uh from Liberties Gas and
 
06:05:12.830 --> 06:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
Electric operations and so really I'm
 
06:05:15.468 --> 06:05:15.478 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to them to explain
 
06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
our system and to talk about some of the
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
issues and challenges so we have Brad
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
Marx who's the manager of engineering
 
06:05:25.390 --> 06:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
for Energy North which is our gas system
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
and Meredith Verner who is the
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
engineering lead for our Electric System
 
06:05:32.110 --> 06:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
for Granite State Electric I just want
 
06:05:34.150 --> 06:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
to say at the outset and kind of preface
 
06:05:38.310 --> 06:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
it that we we our our presentation is a
 
06:05:40.150 --> 06:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more streamlined we we kind
 
06:05:42.390 --> 06:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
of saw that how robust this panel was
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
and in the time frame so we for things
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
that are common to the utilities like
 
06:05:49.788 --> 06:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
storm response and the components of the
 
06:05:51.510 --> 06:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
electric bill and some other things
 
06:05:52.910 --> 06:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're not in our presentation but
 
06:05:55.468 --> 06:05:55.478 align:start position:0%
we're happy to provide that information
 
06:05:58.230 --> 06:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
Liberty specific to to the committee so
 
06:05:59.590 --> 06:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to turn it over to
 
06:06:03.510 --> 06:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
Brad to talk about gas all right thank
 
06:06:06.430 --> 06:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
you Carolyn so yeah here to talk about
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
an overview of the uh natural gas system
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
that Liberty operates in New Hampshire
 
06:06:14.430 --> 06:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're comprised of about 100,000 gas
 
06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
customers and that's across 32
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
communities in the State uh mostly
 
06:06:23.390 --> 06:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
constituted along the i93 corridor uh
 
06:06:25.628 --> 06:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
but we also have we go up to the Lakes
 
06:06:28.430 --> 06:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
Region uh we also have a small system uh
 
06:06:31.030 --> 06:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
up north in Berlin and then out west in
 
06:06:35.708 --> 06:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
Keen we um operate a propane air system
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
we have
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
139 uh gas operations employees in New
 
06:06:44.030 --> 06:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they reside across four gas
 
06:06:47.070 --> 06:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
operations yard those are in Nashua
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester Tilton and
 
06:06:52.750 --> 06:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
Kean so our natural gas distribution
 
06:06:56.190 --> 06:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
system is primarily uh served by one
 
06:06:58.670 --> 06:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
transmission line uh that is the
 
06:07:00.708 --> 06:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
Tennessee gas pipeline owned and
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
operated by Kinder Morgan uh which
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
extends from the Massachusetts its
 
06:07:08.750 --> 06:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
border and actually terminates in
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
conquered uh in addition to that
 
06:07:15.548 --> 06:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
pipeline uh we um are reliant on five
 
06:07:19.150 --> 06:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
LNG and propane air plants uh that are
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
utilized for winter support uh during
 
06:07:21.600 --> 06:07:22.548 align:start position:0%
utilized for winter support uh during
cold

06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
cold
 
06:07:27.910 --> 06:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
weather uh lastly we also have a um 2.8
 
06:07:30.670 --> 06:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
mile transmission line uh that feeds the
 
06:07:37.628 --> 06:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
um so we are committed to serve our
 
06:07:42.270 --> 06:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
customers and to um also expand to new
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
customers uh we believe natural gas
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
Remains the lowest cost and cleanest
 
06:07:49.590 --> 06:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
solution uh for both building heat and
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
for industrial processed thermal energy
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
load uh Liberty continues to see
 
06:07:57.868 --> 06:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
consistent annual customer growth in our
 
06:08:00.190 --> 06:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
area uh we're committed to making
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
natural gas as available to as many
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters uh within our system as
 
06:08:08.670 --> 06:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
possible so how does how how does the
 
06:08:11.628 --> 06:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
gas get to our customers uh so we tap
 
06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
off of uh like I said earlier the
 
06:08:16.510 --> 06:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
transmission line um we have several
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
take stations in our area uh these take
 
06:08:22.510 --> 06:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
stations they meter they
 
06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
odorize um and uh they reduce the
 
06:08:28.150 --> 06:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
pressure from the high transmission
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
pressure to an intermediate
 
06:08:32.468 --> 06:08:32.478 align:start position:0%
pressure um and that's also where the
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
custody is transferred as well uh so
 
06:08:36.990 --> 06:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
that immediate pressure that gets
 
06:08:39.628 --> 06:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
distributed through our system most of
 
06:08:41.708 --> 06:08:41.718 align:start position:0%
our customers are fed directly off of
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
that intermediate pressure uh via uh
 
06:08:48.310 --> 06:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
customer services and then meter and
 
06:08:50.788 --> 06:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
Regulators uh but in some of our more
 
06:08:53.190 --> 06:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
urban areas we do have low pressure
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
systems and uh those are um well there's
 
06:09:00.310 --> 06:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
a pressure uh regulator station District
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
pressure regulator station that takes
 
06:09:04.270 --> 06:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
that intermediate pressure and reduces
 
06:09:06.430 --> 06:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
it to the low pressure press and then
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
the low pressure is provided to
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
customers via services and uh meter sets
 
06:09:11.680 --> 06:09:15.230 align:start position:0%
customers via services and uh meter sets
as

06:09:15.230 --> 06:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:17.830 --> 06:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
well so uh Carolyn mentioned we have
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
challenges and opportunities in our area
 
06:09:22.750 --> 06:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh one is that we have aging
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh Energy North still has
 
06:09:28.390 --> 06:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
31 miles of leak prome pipe uh so that
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
would be our cast iron M our bare steel
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
main uh that's remaining in our
 
06:09:35.708 --> 06:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
distribution system we do have have a
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
program in place to proactively replace
 
06:09:41.430 --> 06:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
this leak prom pipe with modern plastic
 
06:09:45.150 --> 06:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
pipe um and we've made progress uh since
 
06:09:49.230 --> 06:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh 2007 we've replaced approximately 120
 
06:09:51.910 --> 06:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
miles of leak prome pipe uh but we still
 
06:09:54.510 --> 06:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
have some some ways to go here to get
 
06:09:56.468 --> 06:09:56.478 align:start position:0%
that number down to
 
06:09:59.750 --> 06:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
zero and our other uh challenges are
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
around system planning and reliability I
 
06:10:04.110 --> 06:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier we have our one
 
06:10:06.750 --> 06:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
transmission line and we reliant on the
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh what we call our Peak shaving
 
06:10:10.830 --> 06:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
facilities in the winter uh we do have
 
06:10:15.230 --> 06:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
two multi-year projects uh that um are
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
targeted to address system capacity
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and ultimately reduce our
 
06:10:24.070 --> 06:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
Reliance on the peak shaving facilities
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
so one of those projects is a supply
 
06:10:28.948 --> 06:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
enhancement to the greater Manchester in
 
06:10:30.990 --> 06:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh nashway areas that involves a new
 
06:10:34.350 --> 06:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
station in about uh 10 miles of 12in
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
pipe crossing the maram
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
river and uh the other project is uh to
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
feed up north it's a replacement of 10
 
06:10:46.590 --> 06:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
miles of critical pipe that feeds the
 
06:10:46.600 --> 06:10:52.590 align:start position:0%
miles of critical pipe that feeds the
Tilton

06:10:52.590 --> 06:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
area chair I don't know we'll we'll move
 
06:11:01.948 --> 06:11:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.628 --> 06:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
if representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:11:06.830 --> 06:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
question I guess thank you very much um
 
06:11:09.628 --> 06:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
quick question um regarding the plastic
 
06:11:09.638 --> 06:11:11.310 align:start position:0%
quick question um regarding the plastic
pipes

06:11:11.310 --> 06:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
pipes
 
06:11:15.708 --> 06:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
um I isn't there the possibility of them
 
06:11:19.750 --> 06:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
degrading and do they contain past and
 
06:11:22.390 --> 06:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
is the past drawn out of the
 
06:11:25.468 --> 06:11:25.478 align:start position:0%
pipe with the heat so no they do not uh
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
contain past they are um what we call
 
06:11:30.910 --> 06:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
high density high density polyethylene
 
06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
pipe um it has a uh useful life of On
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
The Low End 50 years but on the high end
 
06:11:40.750 --> 06:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
as high as 100
 
06:11:40.760 --> 06:11:44.830 align:start position:0%
as high as 100
years

06:11:44.830 --> 06:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:48.030 --> 06:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
y great we'll move on to Meredith for
 
06:11:50.430 --> 06:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
Granite State hi good afternoon my name
 
06:11:52.310 --> 06:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
is Meredith burner I'm the engineering
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
manager at Liberty Utilities and the
 
06:11:56.190 --> 06:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
electric side Meredith you can move the
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
whole unit okay can you hear me now is
 
06:12:01.868 --> 06:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
that better okay I'm loud in my ear
 
06:12:04.270 --> 06:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
right here um okay so we have about
 
06:12:07.070 --> 06:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
47,00 electric customers from Granite
 
06:12:09.150 --> 06:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
State Electric and if you look at a map
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
of our service territory um we are
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
largely in the Salem area and that
 
06:12:16.430 --> 06:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
southern portion and about half of our
 
06:12:18.510 --> 06:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
customers are in that area and the other
 
06:12:21.230 --> 06:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
half are about in that Northern Area um
 
06:12:23.390 --> 06:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
in that purple and green territory where
 
06:12:25.708 --> 06:12:25.718 align:start position:0%
we have our Lebanon area uh and our
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
Charles Town service area um so we have
 
06:12:32.230 --> 06:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
about 15 substations throughout this
 
06:12:35.230 --> 06:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
area um and 45 feeders which is what
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
feeds the individual customers and uh
 
06:12:40.310 --> 06:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
commercial accounts um and within
 
06:12:43.150 --> 06:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
Granite State we have 67 operations
 
06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
employees so that includes uh
 
06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
engineering our work coordinators and
 
06:12:49.468 --> 06:12:49.478 align:start position:0%
our work planners our vegetation
 
06:12:52.430 --> 06:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
management and of course our linemen um
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
and our field
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
technicians um so our locations we're
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
headquartered in londonairy uh with our
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
gas is where our headquarters is and out
 
06:13:04.948 --> 06:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
we have operations buildings in Salem
 
06:13:07.468 --> 06:13:07.478 align:start position:0%
and and Lebanon our customer walk-in
 
06:13:12.230 --> 06:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:14.670 --> 06:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
conquered so the area of focus I wanted
 
06:13:17.070 --> 06:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
to highlight uh was our reliability and
 
06:13:19.468 --> 06:13:19.478 align:start position:0%
so before we jump into how this is going
 
06:13:21.150 --> 06:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
to how this is showing that we're
 
06:13:23.310 --> 06:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
improving as it's going down I would
 
06:13:26.190 --> 06:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
thought I would explain the uh indexes
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
that were referenced uh so we have
 
06:13:30.910 --> 06:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
safety and S are our indexes that are
 
06:13:33.430 --> 06:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted here and so safy stands for
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
system average interruption frequency
 
06:13:38.468 --> 06:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
index so that is the number of times
 
06:13:40.590 --> 06:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
that customers experience an outage or
 
06:13:43.310 --> 06:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
an interruption and then our s is the
 
06:13:46.350 --> 06:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
system average Interruption duration
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
index so that is the number recorded in
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
the number of minutes uh that an outage
 
06:13:55.510 --> 06:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh lasts should an outage occur uh so in
 
06:14:00.430 --> 06:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
the blue line we have our s which uh the
 
06:14:03.150 --> 06:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
trend line is showing the 5year average
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it looks at the previous 5e and you
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
can see in the trend line it is going
 
06:14:10.070 --> 06:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
down which means the number of when we
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
do an outage the duration has been
 
06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
decreasing over time uh and then the
 
06:14:17.150 --> 06:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
dots the blue dots on the ma uh graph
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
are showing like just the individual
 
06:14:21.190 --> 06:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
year scores that the fiveyear average
 
06:14:22.948 --> 06:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
can really show that smooth downward
 
06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
Trend better uh and then our safety is
 
06:14:29.548 --> 06:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
frequency and so uh same thing so we've
 
06:14:32.310 --> 06:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
experienced uh a large decrease in the
 
06:14:35.070 --> 06:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
number of outages that we experience uh
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
and this can largely be attributed to
 
06:14:38.868 --> 06:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
the amount of investment that we have
 
06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
made uh many years ago uh five or so
 
06:14:45.708 --> 06:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
years ago and previous years uh in our
 
06:14:48.110 --> 06:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
storm hardening and upgrading our
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
conductors from open Bare wire
 
06:14:53.510 --> 06:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
conductors to hendrx covered conductor
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
systems as well as um installing new
 
06:14:58.788 --> 06:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
automated reclosers and sectionalizers
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
on our system to shorten the number of
 
06:15:05.150 --> 06:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
out durations and outages
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh do we have any questions on
 
06:15:09.510 --> 06:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
this questions from the committee
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman yeah I just want
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
to verify so the numbers on the left
 
06:15:16.510 --> 06:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
side for the S actually are minutes yes
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct and also I just want to
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
point out you can thank me for the
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
increased reliability I'm one of your
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
customers I was out there three days
 
06:15:25.990 --> 06:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
several years ago I went and bought a
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:32.628 --> 06:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
again any further
 
06:15:36.070 --> 06:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions okay now let's play the st&amp;
 
06:15:39.468 --> 06:15:39.478 align:start position:0%
version of beat the clock and ask uh the
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Electric Co-op to come
 
06:15:45.350 --> 06:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
forward thank you again I know this
 
06:15:47.590 --> 06:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
probably still question so happy to work
 
06:15:48.990 --> 06:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
with the group uh throughout the
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.150 --> 06:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
you according to
 
06:16:07.628 --> 06:16:07.638 align:start position:0%
my my phone my my watch it's 3:15 you
 
06:16:10.270 --> 06:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
guys have 15 minutes we will do our best
 
06:16:12.510 --> 06:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
to beat the clock okay thank you thank
 
06:16:14.788 --> 06:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
you chairman Vose we are the New
 
06:16:17.230 --> 06:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Cooperative and our
 
06:16:18.750 --> 06:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
presentation is a little bit different
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
than everybody else's because we are
 
06:16:22.670 --> 06:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
very different than everybody else that
 
06:16:24.750 --> 06:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
you've seen so far so I'm Michael
 
06:16:27.150 --> 06:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
Jennings I'm the interum president and
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
CEO at the cooperative and alongside me
 
06:16:32.230 --> 06:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
I have Peter Glenshaw he is our VP of
 
06:16:34.548 --> 06:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
member engagement so government Affairs
 
06:16:34.558 --> 06:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
member engagement so government Affairs
community

06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
everything that deals with our members
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
Peter is responsible for so in the
 
06:16:40.830 --> 06:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
presentation today we really want to
 
06:16:42.270 --> 06:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
tell you about what makes the
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
Cooperative different than other
 
06:16:46.190 --> 06:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
utilities how that kind of started with
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
our mission in 1939 and why that mission
 
06:16:51.990 --> 06:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
is still very important to us today and
 
06:16:54.190 --> 06:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
how we continue to live that
 
06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
mission so we were founded in 1939 to
 
06:17:00.670 --> 06:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
bring electricity to areas of the state
 
06:17:03.948 --> 06:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
that did not have power so you can see
 
06:17:06.670 --> 06:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
on this map here the areas in lime green
 
06:17:09.868 --> 06:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
that's our service territory in 1939
 
06:17:12.110 --> 06:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
there was no electricity in those areas
 
06:17:15.110 --> 06:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the most part and so a bunch of
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire got together
 
06:17:19.628 --> 06:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
to start their own power company as a
 
06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization to bring power to
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
those areas and that's how the New
 
06:17:24.590 --> 06:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Cooperative was
 
06:17:28.030 --> 06:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
founded as a result nowadays it's very
 
06:17:30.150 --> 06:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
different than back then we are actually
 
06:17:32.750 --> 06:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
the second largest electric utility in
 
06:17:35.070 --> 06:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
this state uh the largest cooperative in
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
all of New England so we're we're quite
 
06:17:39.910 --> 06:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
large for an Electric Co-op uh we manage
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
all of that through about 237 employees
 
06:17:47.510 --> 06:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
86,000 M and 6,000 miles a line in the
 
06:17:49.830 --> 06:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
most rural parts of New Hampshire that
 
06:17:54.670 --> 06:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:57.350 --> 06:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
today so a few ways that were different
 
06:17:58.990 --> 06:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
than the other Utilities in the state
 
06:18:01.708 --> 06:18:01.718 align:start position:0%
for one we're nonprofit we do everything
 
06:18:04.310 --> 06:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
at cost for our membership we're a 501
 
06:18:04.320 --> 06:18:05.310 align:start position:0%
at cost for our membership we're a 501
C2

06:18:05.310 --> 06:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
C2
 
06:18:07.310 --> 06:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
organization and because of that we have
 
06:18:09.628 --> 06:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
some advantages as well certain grants
 
06:18:12.230 --> 06:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
we have preferred access to and when we
 
06:18:14.190 --> 06:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
do make a profit we return those
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
operating margins back to our members in
 
06:18:17.990 --> 06:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
the form of capital
 
06:18:20.510 --> 06:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
credits another thing is our ownership
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
so because we are a Cooperative we are
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
owned by the members we serve and I know
 
06:18:28.468 --> 06:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
some of you are Cooperative members
 
06:18:31.670 --> 06:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh we say we work for the
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
members because you are our our
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
customers but also are owners of the
 
06:18:38.750 --> 06:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
company and so it's very different than
 
06:18:41.788 --> 06:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
a typical customer model we have members
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
06:18:44.990 --> 06:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
customers another difference because
 
06:18:47.270 --> 06:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're member owned is our governance so
 
06:18:50.070 --> 06:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
we are governed by an 11 member board of
 
06:18:52.750 --> 06:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
directors that are directly elected by
 
06:18:54.788 --> 06:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
our membership we have elections every
 
06:18:56.590 --> 06:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
single year in which three to four
 
06:18:59.150 --> 06:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
directors are up for election and our
 
06:19:01.708 --> 06:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
members all get to vote in that to
 
06:19:04.190 --> 06:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
determine who runs the organization and
 
06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
because of that that we have a different
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure than the other
 
06:19:11.310 --> 06:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
utilities we are deregulated for power
 
06:19:13.708 --> 06:19:13.718 align:start position:0%
rates because our members through the
 
06:19:15.788 --> 06:19:15.798 align:start position:0%
election of the board of directors
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually make the decisions on how to
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
run the Cooperative so that deregulation
 
06:19:22.708 --> 06:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
is because we by default in our
 
06:19:24.670 --> 06:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
governance structure act in the best
 
06:19:25.910 --> 06:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
interest of our
 
06:19:28.468 --> 06:19:28.478 align:start position:0%
membership and because of that we don't
 
06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
have the same oversight as the other
 
06:19:32.708 --> 06:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
utilities or
 
06:19:35.468 --> 06:19:35.478 align:start position:0%
rates and like I said before and I will
 
06:19:37.230 --> 06:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
say again and again and I say it every
 
06:19:39.670 --> 06:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
day at the job we work for our members
 
06:19:41.670 --> 06:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
so we exist to meet the needs of our
 
06:19:45.150 --> 06:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
members we started doing that in 1939
 
06:19:46.788 --> 06:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
through the electric business and we
 
06:19:49.750 --> 06:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
still do that today um what motivates us
 
06:19:52.510 --> 06:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
now is our new strategic plan that we
 
06:19:55.750 --> 06:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
created in 2024 and it has five Focus
 
06:19:58.670 --> 06:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
areas and if everybody on this committee
 
06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably knows what the most important
 
06:20:03.030 --> 06:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
thing is to Electric rate payers one and
 
06:20:05.788 --> 06:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
two right reliability and affability if
 
06:20:07.390 --> 06:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's just after a storm everybody
 
06:20:09.868 --> 06:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
probably says reliability otherwise it's
 
06:20:12.150 --> 06:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
affordability and we continue to have
 
06:20:14.590 --> 06:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
that mission to promote those for our
 
06:20:17.708 --> 06:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
members uh as a result we're doing very
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
well on the affordability side we have
 
06:20:21.070 --> 06:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
some of the lowest rates in the state
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
both on the distribution and and power
 
06:20:25.230 --> 06:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
supply side the other thing that's
 
06:20:27.150 --> 06:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
important to our members is the member
 
06:20:28.868 --> 06:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
experience you know we want folks when
 
06:20:30.750 --> 06:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
they call in to have a really good
 
06:20:32.310 --> 06:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
positive experience we want you to have
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
a really good member satisfaction and we
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
focus on that and the way we're able to
 
06:20:39.628 --> 06:20:39.638 align:start position:0%
deliver all three of those things is by
 
06:20:41.788 --> 06:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
focusing on our employees because
 
06:20:43.788 --> 06:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that make those things
 
06:20:46.310 --> 06:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
happen so our employee experience is
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
very critical to us and then the newest
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
mission for us is broadband and that's
 
06:20:53.788 --> 06:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
our our newest business and just like we
 
06:20:57.110 --> 06:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
were founded in 1939 to bring essential
 
06:20:59.310 --> 06:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
services at that time electricity to
 
06:21:01.910 --> 06:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
areas that didn't have it we started
 
06:21:03.990 --> 06:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
that same Mission with broadband that's
 
06:21:06.350 --> 06:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things we noticed during Co
 
06:21:08.468 --> 06:21:08.478 align:start position:0%
when everybody was sent home you had to
 
06:21:10.190 --> 06:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
do work from home you had to do school
 
06:21:11.948 --> 06:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
from home and folks couldn't do it
 
06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have the internet
 
06:21:15.510 --> 06:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
that they needed that became the next
 
06:21:17.788 --> 06:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
essential service and a really critical
 
06:21:20.070 --> 06:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
part of our mission at that time to make
 
06:21:21.868 --> 06:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
sure our members had that so we're we're
 
06:21:24.990 --> 06:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
very passionate about that and it really
 
06:21:27.270 --> 06:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
fits with our model of delivering that
 
06:21:28.830 --> 06:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
essential service to areas that don't
 
06:21:31.310 --> 06:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
have it in rural New Hampshire
 
06:21:33.430 --> 06:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
right so we founded New Hampshire
 
06:21:35.110 --> 06:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
Broadband LLC
 
06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
um this is a for-profit but wholly owned
 
06:21:40.750 --> 06:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
subsidy by NHC so the New Hampshire
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative is the the sole
 
06:21:44.868 --> 06:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
owner of New Hampshire Broadband this
 
06:21:46.468 --> 06:21:46.478 align:start position:0%
was really driven by our members
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
speaking out and voting in 2020 because
 
06:21:51.390 --> 06:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
they went home and they didn't have the
 
06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
service that they needed so that drove
 
06:21:55.070 --> 06:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
us to starting the business because our
 
06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
members asked for it so our service is
 
06:22:01.270 --> 06:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
the state-of AR technology it's all
 
06:22:03.948 --> 06:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
fiber it's highspeed we offer 100
 
06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
megabits to to 2 gbits symmetrical
 
06:22:07.788 --> 06:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
internet to folks but our technolog is
 
06:22:09.548 --> 06:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
actually capable of higher speeds than
 
06:22:11.468 --> 06:22:11.478 align:start position:0%
that although most folks equipment in
 
06:22:14.190 --> 06:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
their homes can't handle that so we we
 
06:22:17.230 --> 06:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
just sell the 100 to two gig right now
 
06:22:19.310 --> 06:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
um and and we try to be a no gimmick
 
06:22:21.788 --> 06:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
company we give you a consistent price
 
06:22:24.310 --> 06:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
no special deals or hidden fees we just
 
06:22:26.350 --> 06:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
want to be straightforward and honest
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and deliver that good member
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
satisfaction so this is where we we
 
06:22:33.110 --> 06:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
currently stand and I'll try to save a
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
couple minutes for question but we're in
 
06:22:37.270 --> 06:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
the middle of a a large scale buildout
 
06:22:39.070 --> 06:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
to bring those services to rural New
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh just last year alone we
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
built over a th000 miles of fiber which
 
06:22:47.990 --> 06:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a a really astonishing feat to be
 
06:22:51.070 --> 06:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
building 20 30 miles of fiber a week uh
 
06:22:53.910 --> 06:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
it was no small task but the thing with
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
bringing Broadband to areas they need it
 
06:22:57.990 --> 06:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
everybody wants it yesterday as well and
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can't do it all
 
06:23:01.190 --> 06:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it'll take some time but we're
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
we're trying as hard as we can to get it
 
06:23:05.110 --> 06:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
to our members as fast as we can
 
06:23:08.190 --> 06:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
so today as of a few years ago we had no
 
06:23:10.030 --> 06:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
broadband customers I'm proud to report
 
06:23:12.708 --> 06:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
we have over 5,000 already today and and
 
06:23:15.230 --> 06:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's 5,000 folks that probably
 
06:23:17.948 --> 06:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have access to broadband
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
internet high-speed internet at their
 
06:23:21.310 --> 06:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
home if it wasn't for us bringing that
 
06:23:22.430 --> 06:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
service to
 
06:23:25.150 --> 06:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
them so with that being said I have a
 
06:23:27.270 --> 06:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
few minutes left if there's any
 
06:23:30.510 --> 06:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay questions representative
 
06:23:33.070 --> 06:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you very easy
 
06:23:34.430 --> 06:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
question can you make sure that we have
 
06:23:37.190 --> 06:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
have your contact information
 
06:23:40.030 --> 06:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative parshall thank
 
06:23:42.190 --> 06:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
06:23:46.190 --> 06:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh what Supply options do your customers
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
have are you referring to default supply
 
06:23:51.788 --> 06:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
for electricity not just default but I
 
06:23:53.510 --> 06:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
mean do they have access to community
 
06:23:56.590 --> 06:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
power third party absolutely yes so we
 
06:23:58.230 --> 06:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
have competitive Supply in our service
 
06:24:00.590 --> 06:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
territory just like the other utilities
 
06:24:03.070 --> 06:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh Community power usually requires the
 
06:24:05.390 --> 06:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
town's engagement in to have that
 
06:24:07.670 --> 06:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
available but we like our members to be
 
06:24:10.150 --> 06:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
able to choose so we offer the default
 
06:24:11.750 --> 06:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
Supply service we have a very
 
06:24:13.390 --> 06:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
competitive rate for it and we want to
 
06:24:15.270 --> 06:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
save our members money but if our
 
06:24:16.750 --> 06:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
members don't want to buy it from us as
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
well we're very happy with that we we
 
06:24:20.468 --> 06:24:20.478 align:start position:0%
just want to facilitate whatever it's
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
best for them representative
 
06:24:26.910 --> 06:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
partial thank you chair V the other
 
06:24:30.670 --> 06:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
partial U Can you tell me um boots on
 
06:24:32.910 --> 06:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
the ground line workers uh in order to
 
06:24:35.030 --> 06:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide Rel reliability is that a
 
06:24:37.110 --> 06:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
problem at all and are majority of our
 
06:24:39.270 --> 06:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
line workers employed by the company or
 
06:24:41.708 --> 06:24:41.718 align:start position:0%
are they contracted subl labor so the
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
majority of our line workers right now
 
06:24:46.350 --> 06:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
are uh in-house they they always have
 
06:24:48.510 --> 06:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
been we have a very good Apprentice
 
06:24:50.468 --> 06:24:50.478 align:start position:0%
training program so the majority of our
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
line workers come in um just after Line
 
06:24:54.990 --> 06:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
work school they don't have many years
 
06:24:56.468 --> 06:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
experience in the industry and we work
 
06:24:58.910 --> 06:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
with them to train them up we as a
 
06:25:00.670 --> 06:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
Cooperative typically have very long
 
06:25:03.030 --> 06:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
tenured employees uh folks like the
 
06:25:04.868 --> 06:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
mission and stay a long time and we we
 
06:25:06.430 --> 06:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
try to have that same approach with our
 
06:25:08.830 --> 06:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
line workers and and so if we can train
 
06:25:10.468 --> 06:25:10.478 align:start position:0%
them and keep them it makes for a Better
 
06:25:11.670 --> 06:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
Business for
 
06:25:14.990 --> 06:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
US Representative
 
06:25:18.030 --> 06:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chair um since you
 
06:25:20.910 --> 06:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
are a as you described
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
member um member owned and nonprofit and
 
06:25:27.390 --> 06:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
run all in the interests of the best and
 
06:25:29.310 --> 06:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
lowest cost service for all your members
 
06:25:29.320 --> 06:25:30.230 align:start position:0%
lowest cost service for all your members
what

06:25:30.230 --> 06:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
is the co-op's approach to promote in
 
06:25:38.750 --> 06:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
end use Energy Efficiency do you have a
 
06:25:41.430 --> 06:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
systems benefits charge and do you
 
06:25:43.230 --> 06:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
participate in the New Hampshire saves
 
06:25:45.468 --> 06:25:45.478 align:start position:0%
program or do you operate your
 
06:25:48.190 --> 06:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
own yeah that's great question so we
 
06:25:49.788 --> 06:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
participate in the same New Hampshire
 
06:25:52.868 --> 06:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
saves program U and we are required to
 
06:25:54.628 --> 06:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
um by the same statute that the other
 
06:25:56.868 --> 06:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
utilities applies to so we have the very
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
similar system benefits charge as the
 
06:25:59.040 --> 06:26:00.430 align:start position:0%
similar system benefits charge as the
other

06:26:00.430 --> 06:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
utilities and the last question goes to
 
06:26:05.548 --> 06:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you so much
 
06:26:07.708 --> 06:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
so my question goes to technology I'm
 
06:26:12.310 --> 06:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
curious about the um functionality of
 
06:26:14.270 --> 06:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
the current meters that your customers
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
have you do you supply those meters and
 
06:26:20.390 --> 06:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
if so uh are they smart enough meters to
 
06:26:22.750 --> 06:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
do I think you guys are doing time of
 
06:26:25.548 --> 06:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
use and you're kind of bullish on
 
06:26:27.708 --> 06:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
transactive capabilities so I just want
 
06:26:29.110 --> 06:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
to know a little bit about the
 
06:26:31.788 --> 06:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
technology yeah absolutely uh so we have
 
06:26:35.310 --> 06:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
an Ami metering system we were actually
 
06:26:36.788 --> 06:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
I believe one of the first if not the
 
06:26:38.948 --> 06:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
first in the state to roll it out uh
 
06:26:41.390 --> 06:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
cooperatives tend to be very technology
 
06:26:43.750 --> 06:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
forward and and fast adopters of
 
06:26:46.230 --> 06:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
Technology uh it just happens with being
 
06:26:47.708 --> 06:26:47.718 align:start position:0%
part of our Trade Organization they
 
06:26:50.430 --> 06:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
really push that but because of the Ami
 
06:26:52.750 --> 06:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
technology we're able to leverage more
 
06:26:55.390 --> 06:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
data we have a lot of different uh
 
06:26:57.468 --> 06:26:57.478 align:start position:0%
between time of use metering programs
 
06:27:00.190 --> 06:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's for EVS or solar or net
 
06:27:01.948 --> 06:27:01.958 align:start position:0%
metering there's there's a lot of
 
06:27:03.190 --> 06:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
different options out there for our
 
06:27:03.200 --> 06:27:05.110 align:start position:0%
different options out there for our
members

06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
followup and the so the followup would
 
06:27:10.110 --> 06:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
be does that uh provide an additional
 
06:27:12.430 --> 06:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
benefit as well to your customers in
 
06:27:15.548 --> 06:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
terms of the value that they derive from
 
06:27:17.150 --> 06:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
having that technology
 
06:27:19.830 --> 06:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
available so we think so by providing
 
06:27:22.628 --> 06:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
the option but we try to design our
 
06:27:25.708 --> 06:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
rates so there is no cost sharing
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
between rate classes so when there are
 
06:27:30.670 --> 06:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
there are cost attributable to one
 
06:27:32.708 --> 06:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
classification we try to get that
 
06:27:34.390 --> 06:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
classification to pay for it so they're
 
06:27:38.030 --> 06:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
not being subsidized by other rate
 
06:27:42.510 --> 06:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
classes okay so you guys have done an
 
06:27:45.070 --> 06:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
excellent job of playing st&amp; Beat the
 
06:27:47.350 --> 06:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
Clock and we thank you very much for
 
06:27:49.230 --> 06:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
being here and for making your
 
06:27:51.070 --> 06:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
presentation and we thank all the other
 
06:27:54.390 --> 06:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
utilities as well for your excellent uh
 
06:27:56.350 --> 06:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
presentations now we're going to play a
 
06:27:59.868 --> 06:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
new game this one's called stn runs to
 
06:28:02.430 --> 06:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
the bathroom before the public hearing
 
06:28:06.390 --> 06:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
on HB 106 we'll be back here in three
 
06:28:09.030 --> 06:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
minutes and if you plan to testify
 
06:28:33.030 --> 06:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:33.040 --> 06:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
immediately

06:29:03.030 --> 06:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:03.040 --> 06:29:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:29:33.030 --> 06:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.040 --> 06:30:02.948 align:start position:0%

06:30:32.910 --> 06:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:32.920 --> 06:31:02.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:31:02.910 --> 06:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:02.920 --> 06:31:32.830 align:start position:0%

e

06:32:32.830 --> 06:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:32.840 --> 06:33:02.750 align:start position:0%

06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay everyone let's get started time for
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
our first public hearing of the 2025
 
06:34:03.910 --> 06:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
2026 bium this is on House Bill
 
06:34:06.150 --> 06:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
106 establishing a commission to
 
06:34:08.110 --> 06:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
determine the monetary cost of climate
 
06:34:10.230 --> 06:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
change to the state of New Hampshire and
 
06:34:13.590 --> 06:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
the best means of recouping such costs I
 
06:34:17.708 --> 06:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
have been given 13 pink cards that means
 
06:34:18.910 --> 06:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people who want to
 
06:34:21.070 --> 06:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
testify so I'm going to have to impose
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
time limits so for the prime sponsor of
 
06:34:27.670 --> 06:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm going to allow five minutes
 
06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
for everybody else the limit is three
 
06:34:35.310 --> 06:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
minutes and I will be using my phone to
 
06:34:39.230 --> 06:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh keep track of the time we have a hard
 
06:34:41.110 --> 06:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
stop we have to be out of this building
 
06:34:44.628 --> 06:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
before 5 o' because staff would be on
 
06:34:47.230 --> 06:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
overtime if we stayed longer than that
 
06:34:49.788 --> 06:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
so we have we do have a hard stop we
 
06:34:53.190 --> 06:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
can't go any longer so I ask you to be
 
06:34:56.628 --> 06:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
respectful of our time respectful of the
 
06:34:58.788 --> 06:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
other people behind you who want to
 
06:35:01.868 --> 06:35:01.878 align:start position:0%
testify so try not to run over your time
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
as you testify on this bill
 
06:35:06.590 --> 06:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll turn it over to
 
06:35:09.388 --> 06:35:09.398 align:start position:0%
representative Tony Kaplan to introduce
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
106 yeah good afternoon uh fellow
 
06:35:14.708 --> 06:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record I'm
 
06:35:17.070 --> 06:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Tony Kaplan representing
 
06:35:19.628 --> 06:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
maror M8 the towns of hener Bradford and
 
06:35:22.030 --> 06:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
Warner and uh I just want to thank all
 
06:35:23.788 --> 06:35:23.798 align:start position:0%
the committee members for their patience
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
and uh hard work after two year two days
 
06:35:28.388 --> 06:35:28.398 align:start position:0%
of uh listening to reports now we get to
 
06:35:30.910 --> 06:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
kick off our work session with with my
 
06:35:34.708 --> 06:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill HB 106 and so I will will not waste
 
06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
any more time and just get straight into
 
06:35:38.548 --> 06:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
it this bill establishes a commission to
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
determine the financial cost of climate
 
06:35:42.230 --> 06:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
damage to New Hampshire and best methods
 
06:35:45.150 --> 06:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
of recouping uh those costs as I was
 
06:35:47.230 --> 06:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about how to uh present this
 
06:35:48.788 --> 06:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
bill I kept seeing the news reports
 
06:35:51.868 --> 06:35:51.878 align:start position:0%
about the fires in in Los Angeles and I
 
06:35:54.310 --> 06:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to debate the causes of that
 
06:35:56.510 --> 06:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
fire but just to for all of us to
 
06:35:59.030 --> 06:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
reflect on what an environmental and
 
06:36:01.990 --> 06:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
human tragedy looks like in this country
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I think we can all agree that we
 
06:36:06.548 --> 06:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
should do all we can to make sure such a
 
06:36:08.270 --> 06:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
thing never happens here and also how
 
06:36:10.350 --> 06:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
foolish it would be to believe that it
 
06:36:13.270 --> 06:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
could never happen here that somehow we
 
06:36:15.708 --> 06:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
we are uh immune to these extreme wet
 
06:36:17.468 --> 06:36:17.478 align:start position:0%
weather events that are certainly in
 
06:36:20.430 --> 06:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
some degree attributable to human
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
causes now the problem with climate
 
06:36:23.868 --> 06:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
change is that there has been a lot of
 
06:36:26.590 --> 06:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
exaggeration on both sides of the aisle
 
06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
and so people are rightfully confused so
 
06:36:31.110 --> 06:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know I just want to quickly uh go
 
06:36:33.750 --> 06:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
over what the science says is there is
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
now an extremely high level of
 
06:36:37.270 --> 06:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
scientific confidence as high as it ever
 
06:36:39.430 --> 06:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
gets with physical phenomenon on this
 
06:36:42.388 --> 06:36:42.398 align:start position:0%
scale that human activi best explain the
 
06:36:44.990 --> 06:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
observed rise in global temperatures and
 
06:36:47.388 --> 06:36:47.398 align:start position:0%
also that combined Rising Global
 
06:36:48.948 --> 06:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
continued Rising global temperatures
 
06:36:50.910 --> 06:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
pose a significant risk to our way of
 
06:36:53.750 --> 06:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
life but that individual events at a
 
06:36:55.510 --> 06:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
local level are always caused by a
 
06:36:57.708 --> 06:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
multitude of factors and so you can
 
06:37:00.270 --> 06:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
never say that uh human caused global
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
warming caused that particular hurricane
 
06:37:05.590 --> 06:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
or that particular fire what you can say
 
06:37:07.590 --> 06:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
is that human induced warming increases
 
06:37:09.468 --> 06:37:09.478 align:start position:0%
the probability of these extreme events
 
06:37:11.750 --> 06:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
happening globally and regionally and
 
06:37:14.030 --> 06:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
for our purposes that's definitely good
 
06:37:16.708 --> 06:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
enough science has been soled for a long
 
06:37:18.430 --> 06:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
time on the increased probability of
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
extreme weather plus a certainty of sea
 
06:37:22.548 --> 06:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
level rise around the world with
 
06:37:24.350 --> 06:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases accumulating in the
 
06:37:26.868 --> 06:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
atmosphere at the levels they are the
 
06:37:28.670 --> 06:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
consensus tells us that to keep global
 
06:37:32.150 --> 06:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
warming below the relatively safe 2° C
 
06:37:34.110 --> 06:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
Mark emissions need to declined by
 
06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
roughly 25% by 2030 and reached Net Zero
 
06:37:39.590 --> 06:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
around 2070 I know we've all heard that
 
06:37:41.788 --> 06:37:41.798 align:start position:0%
before but I what I think we haven't
 
06:37:43.990 --> 06:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
heard is that 2024 was the first year
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
that we ever breached the 1.5 Celsius
 
06:37:49.230 --> 06:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
warming Mark above which we can expect
 
06:37:51.388 --> 06:37:51.398 align:start position:0%
significantly more extreme weather
 
06:37:52.948 --> 06:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
events like heat waves droughts
 
06:37:55.030 --> 06:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
wildfires and heavy precipitation
 
06:37:56.788 --> 06:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
leading to Greater risks to food
 
06:37:59.350 --> 06:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
security water availability and human
 
06:38:01.070 --> 06:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
health this
 
06:38:03.990 --> 06:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
year Munich re which is the world's
 
06:38:07.030 --> 06:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
largest reinsurance company said in its
 
06:38:09.270 --> 06:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
annual report that there were more than
 
06:38:11.788 --> 06:38:11.798 align:start position:0%
$240 billion in insured losses around
 
06:38:13.388 --> 06:38:13.398 align:start position:0%
the world and to quote from their annual
 
06:38:15.510 --> 06:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
report our record breaking one record
 
06:38:16.830 --> 06:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
breaking high after another the
 
06:38:18.788 --> 06:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
consequences are devastating the
 
06:38:20.590 --> 06:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
destructive forces of climate change are
 
06:38:22.430 --> 06:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
becoming increasingly evident as backed
 
06:38:24.830 --> 06:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
up by science societies need to prepare
 
06:38:27.350 --> 06:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
for more severe weather
 
06:38:29.430 --> 06:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophes so there's a range of
 
06:38:31.030 --> 06:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
possibilities of what these changes will
 
06:38:32.788 --> 06:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
cost depending on the varying emission
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
scenarios and what we do now versus what
 
06:38:37.468 --> 06:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
we do later according to the 2022 New
 
06:38:40.110 --> 06:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire climate report expected global
 
06:38:42.430 --> 06:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
warming for higher greenhous gas levels
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
is nearly double what we can expect for
 
06:38:47.190 --> 06:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh if we reduce the emissions by
 
06:38:49.510 --> 06:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
mid-century if we succeed in doing that
 
06:38:52.230 --> 06:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
so this commission will look at the most
 
06:38:54.628 --> 06:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
likely scenarios and determine the best
 
06:38:56.750 --> 06:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
estimate but we don't need to debate
 
06:38:58.510 --> 06:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
here our shared concern for our
 
06:39:00.190 --> 06:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
constituents quality of life or the
 
06:39:01.788 --> 06:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
state's economic
 
06:39:04.388 --> 06:39:04.398 align:start position:0%
well-being there must be undoubtedly a
 
06:39:06.750 --> 06:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan interest in fiscal
 
06:39:09.230 --> 06:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility and in the need we have
 
06:39:11.350 --> 06:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
to harden our communities building
 
06:39:13.430 --> 06:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
adaptation and preparing for a future in
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
a changing climate that we're going to
 
06:39:18.430 --> 06:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
see so what are some examples of the
 
06:39:20.430 --> 06:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
proactive work who's uh that the
 
06:39:21.910 --> 06:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
commission might consider we need I just
 
06:39:23.388 --> 06:39:23.398 align:start position:0%
wanted to read into the record a few
 
06:39:27.030 --> 06:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
examples of these uh related to severe

minimizing future losses so just to uh
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
end up I think the commission is ideally
 
06:40:58.750 --> 06:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
Su suited to hearing from experts on
 
06:41:00.388 --> 06:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
these uh varying scenarios and
 
06:41:03.030 --> 06:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
identifying the best possible uh funding
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
me mechanism to meet these costs and so
 
06:41:06.990 --> 06:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we can reach it by
 
06:41:08.548 --> 06:41:08.558 align:start position:0%
Parson consensus and start this
 
06:41:11.548 --> 06:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
conversation with this bill okay thank
 
06:41:13.388 --> 06:41:13.398 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan for
 
06:41:15.788 --> 06:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
introducing your bill I have one quick
 
06:41:19.590 --> 06:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
question for you on the first page of
 
06:41:22.708 --> 06:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
the bill line two finding number one it
 
06:41:26.670 --> 06:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
says that uh climate damage threatens
 
06:41:29.110 --> 06:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with Untold billions of
 
06:41:32.830 --> 06:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in Damages and adaptation costs
 
06:41:36.350 --> 06:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
could you share with us the data that
 
06:41:39.110 --> 06:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
you use to come to the conclusion that
 
06:41:43.030 --> 06:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
this will cost us billions of
 
06:41:45.468 --> 06:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
dollars yeah I mean I I read the the New
 
06:41:47.430 --> 06:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire climate assessment and I
 
06:41:49.590 --> 06:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
looked at uh the center for climate
 
06:41:52.430 --> 06:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh report for New Hampshire
 
06:41:54.990 --> 06:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
and I just looked at some of the
 
06:41:58.070 --> 06:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
estimates that included you know
 
06:41:59.788 --> 06:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
Millions upon millions of dollars in
 
06:42:01.788 --> 06:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure costs not to mention uh
 
06:42:03.868 --> 06:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
health care costs
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh damage to the economy such as maple
 
06:42:09.510 --> 06:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
syrup production ski industry
 
06:42:13.948 --> 06:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh loss of property um with
 
06:42:16.070 --> 06:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
rising sea levels along the Sea Coast
 
06:42:18.150 --> 06:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars there
 
06:42:20.670 --> 06:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
so um you know that's that's in the
 
06:42:24.230 --> 06:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
findings it's it's not a hard figure uh
 
06:42:27.190 --> 06:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
but I believe it's possibly in the in
 
06:42:28.590 --> 06:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
the billions of
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
dollars so my follow-up question would
 
06:42:34.590 --> 06:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
be this is not actually a f this is a
 
06:42:36.990 --> 06:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
prediction exactly that's it's it's a
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
prediction of damage in the in the
 
06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
coming decades so from 20 to 50 year
 
06:42:43.150 --> 06:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
06:42:46.750 --> 06:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
roughly chair recognizes representative
 
06:42:48.990 --> 06:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
ner thank you Mr
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
chairman can you please tell me how many
 
06:42:55.468 --> 06:42:55.478 align:start position:0%
of the almost 50 catastrophic climate
 
06:42:57.468 --> 06:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
predictions that have been made since
 
06:43:00.110 --> 06:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
1970 have come
 
06:43:02.270 --> 06:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
true I I can't answer that question
 
06:43:03.910 --> 06:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
because I don't know which
 
06:43:06.910 --> 06:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
predictions you're referring to so all I
 
06:43:08.670 --> 06:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that there's no question
 
06:43:10.388 --> 06:43:10.398 align:start position:0%
that the likelihood of extreme weather
 
06:43:12.868 --> 06:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
events due to warming of the atmosphere
 
06:43:17.110 --> 06:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
is is uh is is is without a doubt uh
 
06:43:21.230 --> 06:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to occur follow up well my whole
 
06:43:23.868 --> 06:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
life there's been attempts to predict um
 
06:43:27.670 --> 06:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
future Calamity from the climate and um
 
06:43:30.510 --> 06:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
they've all failed so these predictions
 
06:43:32.270 --> 06:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
have all failed so why should we endorse
 
06:43:34.030 --> 06:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
this one
 
06:43:35.670 --> 06:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
well I I just again I don't know what
 
06:43:37.150 --> 06:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
predictions you're referring to I think
 
06:43:40.830 --> 06:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
if you just uh you know refer back to my
 
06:43:41.990 --> 06:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
my opening statement I don't think you
 
06:43:44.388 --> 06:43:44.398 align:start position:0%
can point to any any particular event
 
06:43:46.468 --> 06:43:46.478 align:start position:0%
and say that was definitely caused by
 
06:43:48.750 --> 06:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
human uh Glo human induced global
 
06:43:50.548 --> 06:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
warming but there's no doubt that the
 
06:43:53.430 --> 06:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
probability of these increased extreme
 
06:43:57.190 --> 06:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
events occurring on a regional level uh
 
06:43:59.350 --> 06:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
is is there's more probability of those
 
06:44:01.310 --> 06:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
of those events in in future years
 
06:44:02.548 --> 06:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt the science clearly
 
06:44:05.310 --> 06:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:10.670 --> 06:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:13.510 --> 06:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
question okay representative Wendy
 
06:44:15.990 --> 06:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
06:44:18.830 --> 06:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative parall um thank
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
you for uh presenting this bill uh I'm
 
06:44:24.830 --> 06:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at page two uh line
 
06:44:27.510 --> 06:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
26 where you uh the commission would
 
06:44:29.788 --> 06:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
look at the likely scope of damage to
 
06:44:32.590 --> 06:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can you tell me how this
 
06:44:35.830 --> 06:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
Commission could financially benefit New
 
06:44:38.628 --> 06:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's industry specifically um
 
06:44:40.230 --> 06:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
some of the ones that are called out
 
06:44:43.628 --> 06:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
tourism Agriculture and small business
 
06:44:45.030 --> 06:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
well I I think there's a definite
 
06:44:49.310 --> 06:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
benefit for State leaders uh industry
 
06:44:49.320 --> 06:44:50.868 align:start position:0%
benefit for State leaders uh industry
leaders

06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
leaders
 
06:44:54.350 --> 06:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh influence influencers so to speak to
 
06:44:57.070 --> 06:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
know what these actual damages uh in
 
06:44:59.310 --> 06:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
would incur to our our leading
 
06:45:01.468 --> 06:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
Industries and so I think the light of
 
06:45:03.868 --> 06:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
day is the best disinfectant and comes
 
06:45:06.150 --> 06:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh with you know with knowing the actual
 
06:45:08.070 --> 06:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
facts what is the scope of of what are
 
06:45:09.430 --> 06:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
we looking at what is the scope of the
 
06:45:12.430 --> 06:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
actual damage to the economy in terms of
 
06:45:15.788 --> 06:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know actual benefits from knowing
 
06:45:18.670 --> 06:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
the figures I mean uh this this
 
06:45:18.680 --> 06:45:19.948 align:start position:0%
the figures I mean uh this this
commission

06:45:19.948 --> 06:45:19.958 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:45:22.990 --> 06:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
would is is charged with coming up with
 
06:45:25.388 --> 06:45:25.398 align:start position:0%
a list of actual recommendations for for
 
06:45:27.310 --> 06:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
adaptation work and so to the extent
 
06:45:28.990 --> 06:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
that those Industries depend on
 
06:45:31.868 --> 06:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure depend on uh our you know
 
06:45:33.670 --> 06:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
our public resources they would
 
06:45:36.430 --> 06:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
definitely benefit from uh us doing the
 
06:45:38.070 --> 06:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
necessary work to harden ourselves and
 
06:45:40.548 --> 06:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
to you know build resilience to to the
 
06:45:43.310 --> 06:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
coming um climate damage that we're
 
06:45:45.990 --> 06:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to incur representative Bernardi
 
06:45:47.030 --> 06:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
has a
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman pivoting
 
06:45:52.030 --> 06:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
right off of that answer that you just
 
06:45:54.548 --> 06:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
gave the responsibility of the
 
06:45:56.510 --> 06:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
commission is to propose is reports
 
06:45:58.670 --> 06:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations for
 
06:46:02.190 --> 06:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation yet in your list of
 
06:46:05.430 --> 06:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
all the uh activity is there to look at
 
06:46:09.230 --> 06:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
and to do nothing in there is about uh
 
06:46:11.708 --> 06:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation it's it's looking
 
06:46:14.070 --> 06:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
at a bunch of different
 
06:46:18.070 --> 06:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios so there's no recommendations
 
06:46:21.548 --> 06:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
from that section yeah I'm talking about
 
06:46:25.948 --> 06:46:25.958 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 versus Roman 5 that's a complete
 
06:46:27.990 --> 06:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
disconnect are you are you referring to
 
06:46:30.510 --> 06:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
the list of of uh scope of work that I
 
06:46:32.230 --> 06:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
just referred to in my in my in my
 
06:46:35.430 --> 06:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
speech that my testimony yeah section
 
06:46:38.750 --> 06:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
Roman three lists all these
 
06:46:41.628 --> 06:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
activities that you you're to study
 
06:46:44.310 --> 06:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
right and scenarios and
 
06:46:48.230 --> 06:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
whatnot and yet Roman five talks about
 
06:46:48.240 --> 06:46:51.310 align:start position:0%
whatnot and yet Roman five talks about
proposing

06:46:51.310 --> 06:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:54.548 --> 06:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
legislation it's not the it's not the
 
06:46:54.558 --> 06:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
legislation it's not the it's not the
same

06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:46:59.270 --> 06:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
thing yeah I mean Roman 3 is dealing
 
06:47:01.430 --> 06:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
with estimating the cost of all of all
 
06:47:04.750 --> 06:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
that work right uh my proposed the
 
06:47:07.388 --> 06:47:07.398 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is more in terms of
 
06:47:09.070 --> 06:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms and what would be the
 
06:47:10.948 --> 06:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
best means of recouping and for the
 
06:47:12.590 --> 06:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
state to start setting aside the money
 
06:47:14.110 --> 06:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to do that work that's the
 
06:47:14.120 --> 06:47:15.190 align:start position:0%
necessary to do that work that's the
proposed

06:47:15.190 --> 06:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
06:47:18.190 --> 06:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
legislation okay that's that's not what
 
06:47:19.830 --> 06:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
that might not be clear and that that
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
might be you know need to be more
 
06:47:25.110 --> 06:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
precisely worded I take that uh you know
 
06:47:28.150 --> 06:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
I take that criticism on
 
06:47:30.750 --> 06:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
board okay thank you representative for
 
06:47:32.628 --> 06:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill seeing no more
 
06:47:34.310 --> 06:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
question questions I'll call next on
 
06:47:45.628 --> 06:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:48.310 --> 06:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
Sebert I hope I got that right
 
06:47:52.830 --> 06:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:56.110 --> 06:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon um my name is
 
06:47:59.030 --> 06:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Christine cybert I am
 
06:48:02.868 --> 06:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
from um Manchester's W one Hillsboro
 
06:48:06.070 --> 06:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
district 21 um I signed on to sponsor
 
06:48:08.548 --> 06:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
this legislation because I believe we
 
06:48:11.628 --> 06:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
owe it to the people of New Hampshire to
 
06:48:15.388 --> 06:48:15.398 align:start position:0%
do this study instead of waiting until
 
06:48:21.230 --> 06:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
just H it'ss the fan so to speak um I
 
06:48:24.270 --> 06:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out that often when
 
06:48:26.190 --> 06:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
the costs go up such as like for
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
insurance which insurance companies have
 
06:48:30.868 --> 06:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
come out and estimated themselves that
 
06:48:33.350 --> 06:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is and already said that will raise
 
06:48:35.830 --> 06:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
rates and all that kind of such a thing
 
06:48:38.590 --> 06:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
and we've had agricultural losses you
 
06:48:40.750 --> 06:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
know a lot of those losses and those
 
06:48:42.990 --> 06:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
extra costs get passed down to the
 
06:48:45.590 --> 06:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
consumer we know that at the consumer
 
06:48:48.510 --> 06:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
level at the small business level for
 
06:48:50.948 --> 06:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
our local farms we have a lot of for the
 
06:48:54.070 --> 06:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
tourist industry it directly affects
 
06:48:57.430 --> 06:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
them and directly hits them um so we
 
06:48:59.468 --> 06:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
really owe it to them to at least look
 
06:49:02.310 --> 06:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
at this um and do the benefit cost
 
06:49:05.230 --> 06:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
analysis is it's the smart pre
 
06:49:08.350 --> 06:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
Preparatory thing to do we can also
 
06:49:08.360 --> 06:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
Preparatory thing to do we can also
identify

06:49:09.910 --> 06:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
identify
 
06:49:13.190 --> 06:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities um which and also cost
 
06:49:15.750 --> 06:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis for mitigation and
 
06:49:18.350 --> 06:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
adaption and just overall understanding
 
06:49:20.388 --> 06:49:20.398 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
06:49:24.230 --> 06:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
impact um and I also wanted to add that
 
06:49:26.310 --> 06:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
when I was knocking doors this past
 
06:49:30.150 --> 06:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
summer people were very they want
 
06:49:31.948 --> 06:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
government to work they want people to
 
06:49:34.110 --> 06:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
work together
 
06:49:36.670 --> 06:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
and you know ultimately that's what
 
06:49:38.270 --> 06:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
they're looking for they're looking for
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
us to do our job and so I believe that
 
06:49:43.830 --> 06:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
this would help we're we're already
 
06:49:45.750 --> 06:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
seeing as well with
 
06:49:48.150 --> 06:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampton um what just happened recently
 
06:49:49.708 --> 06:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
they're having to pay a lot of money
 
06:49:52.110 --> 06:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
that they weren't intending on having to
 
06:49:54.628 --> 06:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
spend when it comes to the
 
06:49:56.990 --> 06:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
causeway um and there are many other
 
06:49:59.548 --> 06:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
examples of that where we aren't
 
06:50:01.590 --> 06:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
bringing in the revenue we are or we
 
06:50:04.708 --> 06:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
should be um due to this so it's
 
06:50:07.510 --> 06:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for us to take a look at it
 
06:50:10.270 --> 06:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
and see what comes out of it thank you
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
for your time does anyone have any
 
06:50:15.948 --> 06:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
questions for me I have a any questions
 
06:50:18.388 --> 06:50:18.398 align:start position:0%
representative Summers just a very quick
 
06:50:20.310 --> 06:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
question I I know you're just you're a
 
06:50:22.388 --> 06:50:22.398 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill but I have I
 
06:50:24.708 --> 06:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
have a question of uh I know we talk
 
06:50:27.670 --> 06:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
about a lot of scenarios and options and
 
06:50:30.030 --> 06:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
what could happen in the future however
 
06:50:31.788 --> 06:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
is there any Court findings currently
 
06:50:33.548 --> 06:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
that have found mon monetary law
 
06:50:36.670 --> 06:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
specifically caused by by climate change
 
06:50:39.070 --> 06:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
in within New Hampshire they would
 
06:50:43.788 --> 06:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
study I wouldn't know that in particular
 
06:50:45.868 --> 06:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
06:50:48.788 --> 06:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much appreciate
 
06:50:52.190 --> 06:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
that next up moving right
 
06:50:55.590 --> 06:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
along I'd like to call up Michael sonunu
 
06:51:00.750 --> 06:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
of newfields New Hampshire representing
 
06:51:03.150 --> 06:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
himself you have a very famous this last
 
06:51:05.990 --> 06:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
name uh just coincidence it's just
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
coincidence okay uh thank you Mr
 
06:51:09.910 --> 06:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you members of the
 
06:51:14.110 --> 06:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm here to speak on uh HB
 
06:51:16.628 --> 06:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
106 I'll try to make it
 
06:51:19.270 --> 06:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
brief uh please note that I submitted
 
06:51:21.310 --> 06:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
about 15 pages of more detailed
 
06:51:23.070 --> 06:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
information to the chairman hopefully
 
06:51:25.350 --> 06:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
that will uh provide you with additional
 
06:51:27.430 --> 06:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
background uh good governance requires
 
06:51:29.868 --> 06:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
that new laws are based on good data bad
 
06:51:31.830 --> 06:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
law based on Good Intentions without
 
06:51:33.190 --> 06:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
being grounded
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
real facts is still bad law I'd argue
 
06:51:38.150 --> 06:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the underlying premise of HB 106 is
 
06:51:39.510 --> 06:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
that there are scientifically based
 
06:51:40.990 --> 06:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
links between fossil fuel-based
 
06:51:43.750 --> 06:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
anthropogenic CO2 emissions with we
 
06:51:45.070 --> 06:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
weather related damages here in New
 
06:51:47.388 --> 06:51:47.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today and in the future and
 
06:51:49.150 --> 06:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
that pre premise is actually factually
 
06:51:51.670 --> 06:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
incorrect which makes HB 106 bad
 
06:51:54.548 --> 06:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
legislation and bad governance um let me
 
06:51:56.150 --> 06:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
take an objective approach and real
 
06:51:57.910 --> 06:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
quickly go through some of the factual
 
06:51:59.468 --> 06:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
information that has been provided to
 
06:52:01.468 --> 06:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
this committee the most impactful
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
weather related damages in New Hampshire
 
06:52:05.030 --> 06:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
has actually been historical flooding
 
06:52:06.750 --> 06:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
the worst most recent flood was due to
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
the Hurricane Irene back in August
 
06:52:10.990 --> 06:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
2011 given that it was the most
 
06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
impactful event in recent memory we
 
06:52:13.868 --> 06:52:13.878 align:start position:0%
should be able to see Trends in
 
06:52:15.788 --> 06:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
Hurricane data for either frequency or
 
06:52:17.868 --> 06:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
intensity of cyclones activity that
 
06:52:21.150 --> 06:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
would justify CO2 man-made CO2 driving
 
06:52:23.230 --> 06:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
this type of activity but it doesn't
 
06:52:25.990 --> 06:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
exist information that is readily
 
06:52:28.468 --> 06:52:28.478 align:start position:0%
available from people like Dr Ryan Maui
 
06:52:30.830 --> 06:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh or take a look at the most recent
 
06:52:32.628 --> 06:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
Cyclone study in nature magazine from
 
06:52:35.628 --> 06:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
December 2024 indicates no Trends in
 
06:52:37.230 --> 06:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hurricane frequency no Trends in
 
06:52:40.070 --> 06:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hurricane intensity no F Trends in major
 
06:52:42.150 --> 06:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
Hurrican hurricane occurrence and no
 
06:52:43.990 --> 06:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
Trends in the Atlantic Basin whatsoever
 
06:52:45.548 --> 06:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
which is the Basin that actually impacts
 
06:52:48.548 --> 06:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in addition I've provided
 
06:52:49.910 --> 06:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
information about River Crest events
 
06:52:52.070 --> 06:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
here in new New Hampshire uh along most
 
06:52:53.270 --> 06:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the major
 
06:52:57.230 --> 06:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
rivers uh I wrote about this extensively
 
06:52:59.708 --> 06:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago in commenting about
 
06:53:02.590 --> 06:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
the coastal hazards report uh when you
 
06:53:04.270 --> 06:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
look at high Crest activity over the
 
06:53:06.830 --> 06:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
last 25 years it's actually down
 
06:53:08.270 --> 06:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
historically from what we've seen over
 
06:53:10.270 --> 06:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
the last century the worst River
 
06:53:11.990 --> 06:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
floodings precipitation events that have
 
06:53:14.350 --> 06:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
taken place in the state isn't in 2000
 
06:53:18.070 --> 06:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
and 2010 it's in the 1920s and the 1930s
 
06:53:21.468 --> 06:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
having nothing to do with CO2 if there's
 
06:53:25.070 --> 06:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
if there is no direct Trend correlated
 
06:53:27.510 --> 06:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
with CO2 emissions for flooding and
 
06:53:30.030 --> 06:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
damage in the state it's impossible to
 
06:53:31.628 --> 06:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
say that the companies that this
 
06:53:34.468 --> 06:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
legislation is targeting is responsible
 
06:53:36.990 --> 06:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
for these types of Damages they're not
 
06:53:39.270 --> 06:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
outside the range of natural variability
 
06:53:41.230 --> 06:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
I also looked at sea level rise data
 
06:53:44.430 --> 06:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
over the last 100 years the one gauge
 
06:53:47.070 --> 06:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
station here in New Hampshire has in uh
 
06:53:50.628 --> 06:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
has the same two millimeter Pere rise in
 
06:53:52.990 --> 06:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
sea level that has had has had for the
 
06:53:55.830 --> 06:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
last 100 years uh Global sea level rise
 
06:53:57.990 --> 06:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
has not changed appreciably over the
 
06:54:00.110 --> 06:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
last 200 years since we left the little
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
Ice Age um clearly we have had damages
 
06:54:06.350 --> 06:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
on the coast but it is impossible unless
 
06:54:08.190 --> 06:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
unless there's some acceleration in sea
 
06:54:10.510 --> 06:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
level to associate that with CO2
 
06:54:13.230 --> 06:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
emissions again making the underlying
 
06:54:14.990 --> 06:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
premise of this legislation difficult to
 
06:54:17.110 --> 06:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
justify my last Point here and I'll make
 
06:54:19.510 --> 06:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
it quickly uh Mr chairman is that even
 
06:54:22.468 --> 06:54:22.478 align:start position:0%
the ipcc acknowledges there's no
 
06:54:27.670 --> 06:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
attribution of almost any uh climate uh
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
impacts that they can attribute to CO2
 
06:54:33.350 --> 06:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes temperature R is about the only
 
06:54:35.310 --> 06:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
thing that's correlated but if you go to
 
06:54:39.190 --> 06:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
table 1212 and working group one AR6
 
06:54:42.030 --> 06:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
which is the base science the real
 
06:54:45.150 --> 06:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
science that holds up all the a ipcc
 
06:54:47.670 --> 06:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
reports what you'll find in that table
 
06:54:52.468 --> 06:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
is that the there floods droughts uh
 
06:54:55.830 --> 06:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
snowfall uh ocean activity none of this
 
06:54:57.310 --> 06:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
they can attribute based on the
 
06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
historical data to CO2 emissions and not
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
only that but they don't expect by 20 50
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to associate any of this with
 
06:55:08.628 --> 06:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
CO2 emissions in other words the ipcc
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
itself acknowledges that attribution of
 
06:55:13.350 --> 06:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
most of these climate impacted weather
 
06:55:16.548 --> 06:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
events cannot be attributed to
 
06:55:19.468 --> 06:55:19.478 align:start position:0%
CO2 given all of this given the fact
 
06:55:21.510 --> 06:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
that that the economics of this
 
06:55:23.350 --> 06:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't think has been fully
 
06:55:25.350 --> 06:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
thought out when it comes to the
 
06:55:27.230 --> 06:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
consumers of energy here in the state
 
06:55:29.708 --> 06:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
and the uh businesses here in the state
 
06:55:32.670 --> 06:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
I would strongly recommend that this
 
06:55:36.628 --> 06:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
committee uh reject HB 106 I'll take any
 
06:55:39.910 --> 06:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:44.350 --> 06:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
now thank you uh Vice chair Thomas has a
 
06:55:46.388 --> 06:55:46.398 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:55:49.430 --> 06:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
you you seem to have done a lot of
 
06:55:52.910 --> 06:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
extensive research into this there have
 
06:55:56.628 --> 06:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
been a lot of um reports various reports
 
06:55:59.388 --> 06:55:59.398 align:start position:0%
citing increases in just about
 
06:56:01.388 --> 06:56:01.398 align:start position:0%
everything having to do with atmosphere
 
06:56:04.270 --> 06:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
can you tell me uh have all these
 
06:56:06.750 --> 06:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
reports been over the same period of
 
06:56:09.868 --> 06:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
time or are there gaps in time or are
 
06:56:11.590 --> 06:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
the reports that cover a longer period
 
06:56:14.388 --> 06:56:14.398 align:start position:0%
of history that would show maybe a
 
06:56:16.750 --> 06:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
different Trend can you comment on that
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
sure the most of the alarmist type uh uh
 
06:56:23.910 --> 06:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
events that are projected are really
 
06:56:27.190 --> 06:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
based on what is called RCP 8.5 that's a
 
06:56:30.670 --> 06:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
scenario um uh the relative climate uh
 
06:56:34.830 --> 06:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
pathway that the uh ipcc uses for model
 
06:56:37.868 --> 06:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
projections and if you do any extensive
 
06:56:39.670 --> 06:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
if you have any extensive understanding
 
06:56:42.628 --> 06:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
of the the modeling itself it is an
 
06:56:45.030 --> 06:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
academic exercise it's recognized that
 
06:56:47.628 --> 06:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
it should not be used as a policy tool
 
06:56:50.430 --> 06:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
um that it the assumptions underlying
 
06:56:53.350 --> 06:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
RCP 8.5 are unrealistic they make
 
06:56:55.030 --> 06:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
assumptions that assume for example that
 
06:56:56.868 --> 06:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
the world will be using 10 times more
 
06:57:01.190 --> 06:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
coal in uh in 2100 than we do today
 
06:57:04.510 --> 06:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
which is patently outrageous um it makes
 
06:57:06.270 --> 06:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
assumpt assumptions that there's going
 
06:57:08.830 --> 06:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
to be no new technology developments
 
06:57:11.430 --> 06:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
between now and 2100 that will allow us
 
06:57:14.788 --> 06:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
to utilize other forms of energy so RCP
 
06:57:17.628 --> 06:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
8.5 which drives
 
06:57:20.270 --> 06:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
almost by far the majority of the
 
06:57:22.110 --> 06:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
climate science and the reports that you
 
06:57:24.510 --> 06:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
see and you see the headlines on is not
 
06:57:26.708 --> 06:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
based in reality and unfortunately that
 
06:57:29.590 --> 06:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
drives a lot of policy decisions and yet
 
06:57:31.830 --> 06:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
as I said before most scientists who
 
06:57:31.840 --> 06:57:32.628 align:start position:0%
as I said before most scientists who
actually

06:57:32.628 --> 06:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:57:35.830 --> 06:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
look at this recognize that RCP 8.5
 
06:57:40.948 --> 06:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:40.958 --> 06:57:42.670 align:start position:0%
 
determinations

06:57:42.670 --> 06:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
06:57:45.350 --> 06:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
so when eversource was here a little
 
06:57:46.910 --> 06:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
while ago to
 
06:57:50.628 --> 06:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
testify or to make a presentation about
 
06:57:53.070 --> 06:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
their company they stated there there
 
06:57:58.830 --> 06:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
was a uh frequency and intensity of
 
06:58:01.110 --> 06:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
storm increasing
 
06:58:04.788 --> 06:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
trend in uh New Hampshire is that true
 
06:58:08.788 --> 06:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh I I I can't State uh specifically to
 
06:58:10.590 --> 06:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
the analysis they made but let me say
 
06:58:12.788 --> 06:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
this they were basing it certainly
 
06:58:14.270 --> 06:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
appeared that they were basing those
 
06:58:17.070 --> 06:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
claims on dollar figures of what it
 
06:58:19.230 --> 06:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
costs for a particular storm not
 
06:58:21.270 --> 06:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily any weather related
 
06:58:24.750 --> 06:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
intensity factors um not based on any
 
06:58:26.590 --> 06:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
kind of what I would say real dollar
 
06:58:28.788 --> 06:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
comparisons when you look at the worst
 
06:58:32.190 --> 06:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
incidents in the state again go back to
 
06:58:36.030 --> 06:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
the 1936 floods $25 million of damage in
 
06:58:38.830 --> 06:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
this state in real current dollars
 
06:58:40.788 --> 06:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
that's close to 600 million dollar worth
 
06:58:43.110 --> 06:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
of damage which I believe is far more
 
06:58:45.628 --> 06:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
than any of the events on the eversource
 
06:58:48.388 --> 06:58:48.398 align:start position:0%
sheet um the floods of
 
06:58:52.430 --> 06:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
1927 in the State uh $22 Million worth
 
06:58:56.468 --> 06:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
of damage um these when you when you do
 
06:58:59.270 --> 06:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
an Apples to Apples comparison of
 
06:59:01.230 --> 06:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
current dollars what you'll find is that
 
06:59:03.230 --> 06:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
the most damaging events in the state
 
06:59:05.990 --> 06:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't take place in the last 25 years
 
06:59:08.910 --> 06:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
they took place 100 years ago um and
 
06:59:11.310 --> 06:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
understand too that's despite the fact
 
06:59:15.270 --> 06:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we have more impervious surface we
 
06:59:18.868 --> 06:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
have um more development uh and
 
06:59:20.430 --> 06:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
obviously you know uh more
 
06:59:22.388 --> 06:59:22.398 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to damage today than we
 
06:59:25.030 --> 06:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
had back then and yet dollar for dooll
 
06:59:27.510 --> 06:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
the impacts were far more significant in
 
06:59:29.590 --> 06:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
that time frame again I don't think
 
06:59:31.670 --> 06:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
eversource looked at it in that way but
 
06:59:34.750 --> 06:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to look at the damages
 
06:59:36.910 --> 06:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
associated with these events you you
 
06:59:38.510 --> 06:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
really need to do it on a on a dollar
 
06:59:40.868 --> 06:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
for dooll
 
06:59:43.468 --> 06:59:43.478 align:start position:0%
basis representative Swanson has a
 
06:59:47.030 --> 06:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
question so uh thank you Mr chair and
 
06:59:48.230 --> 06:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:59:51.750 --> 06:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
senu um a lot of information a lot to
 
06:59:54.708 --> 06:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
check on uh just to look at what ever
 
06:59:57.150 --> 06:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
Source presented us on PID or slide
 
06:59:59.750 --> 06:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
seven uh there's no mention of dollar
 
07:00:03.628 --> 07:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
cost uh they ranked the frequency and
 
07:00:06.910 --> 07:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
damage based upon the customer outage
 
07:00:09.310 --> 07:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
restoration duration so there was no
 
07:00:11.350 --> 07:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
mention so I didn't see the slides I was
 
07:00:12.868 --> 07:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
only making assumption based on the
 
07:00:16.070 --> 07:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussion here and follow while I have
 
07:00:18.150 --> 07:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
a question yes go ahead with your
 
07:00:19.270 --> 07:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
question make it quick please two
 
07:00:21.430 --> 07:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
related questions number
 
07:00:26.388 --> 07:00:26.398 align:start position:0%
one uh is the amount of CO2 in the
 
07:00:30.270 --> 07:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
atmosphere uh actually increasing as
 
07:00:33.388 --> 07:00:33.398 align:start position:0%
measured since 1950 7 when measurements
 
07:00:36.350 --> 07:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
started and number two can you
 
07:00:40.110 --> 07:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee that uh given the evidence of
 
07:00:42.468 --> 07:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
impact of global warming throughout in
 
07:00:44.910 --> 07:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
other portions of the country can you
 
07:00:47.350 --> 07:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
guarantee that that will never impact
 
07:00:50.750 --> 07:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so with respect to CO2
 
07:00:54.468 --> 07:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
yeah mon monola data which is is the
 
07:00:58.110 --> 07:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
accepted uh evaluation of CO2 levels in
 
07:01:00.868 --> 07:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
the in the in the in the globe uh has
 
07:01:03.788 --> 07:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
been steadily increasing since the 1950s
 
07:01:06.830 --> 07:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
although I will say that the the uh
 
07:01:09.310 --> 07:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
tenuousness of whether that's related to
 
07:01:12.150 --> 07:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
man's emissions became a real question
 
07:01:15.150 --> 07:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
after 2020 when the global economy shut
 
07:01:17.628 --> 07:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
down and there were massive reductions
 
07:01:21.110 --> 07:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
in global CO2 emissions that Trend
 
07:01:24.030 --> 07:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
didn't change one lick which which
 
07:01:26.388 --> 07:01:26.398 align:start position:0%
raises the question of whether the CO2
 
07:01:28.270 --> 07:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
itself is actually due to natural
 
07:01:30.430 --> 07:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
variability or whether mankind is
 
07:01:32.230 --> 07:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
actually having an influence because we
 
07:01:35.270 --> 07:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
did if we had that strong an effect on
 
07:01:37.430 --> 07:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
it and I don't question that we're we're
 
07:01:39.910 --> 07:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
emitting CO2 into the atmosphere but if
 
07:01:42.510 --> 07:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
we had that strong of of an effect on
 
07:01:45.270 --> 07:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
co2 we should have seen some kind of
 
07:01:48.230 --> 07:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
change based on that massive economic
 
07:01:50.830 --> 07:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
change in global activity in 2020 as to
 
07:01:52.310 --> 07:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
your other question regarding the
 
07:01:55.388 --> 07:01:55.398 align:start position:0%
temperatures um again i' I'd fall back
 
07:01:57.430 --> 07:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
on the data I think it's incumbent on
 
07:01:59.868 --> 07:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
somebody who's going to impose costs on
 
07:02:01.910 --> 07:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
companies who are doing business here
 
07:02:04.230 --> 07:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
who are providing a an incredibly
 
07:02:07.310 --> 07:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
important energy resource in this state
 
07:02:10.388 --> 07:02:10.398 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to to basically you
 
07:02:11.990 --> 07:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
know threaten their business and what's
 
07:02:15.590 --> 07:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
going on the the burden of proof should
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
be on this committee and this
 
07:02:19.990 --> 07:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to say Beyond a reasonable
 
07:02:22.868 --> 07:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
doubt we think that we can
 
07:02:26.190 --> 07:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
connect Co your CO2 emissions to these
 
07:02:28.350 --> 07:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
damages and therefore recoup it it
 
07:02:30.708 --> 07:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the other way around and so
 
07:02:32.510 --> 07:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
my point here is
 
07:02:35.468 --> 07:02:35.478 align:start position:0%
there's no indication in the data that
 
07:02:37.750 --> 07:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
the damages that we see that the the
 
07:02:40.510 --> 07:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
weather activity we see has anything to
 
07:02:43.030 --> 07:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
do outside of natural variability or is
 
07:02:45.070 --> 07:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
at all correlated with CO2 emissions
 
07:02:49.070 --> 07:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
followup question Mr chair Mr chair
 
07:02:53.110 --> 07:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
time okay we we have a lot of people yes
 
07:02:55.230 --> 07:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for your testimony
 
07:02:57.910 --> 07:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
it was excellent and we do have to move
 
07:02:59.788 --> 07:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
on so thank you and if anyone has other
 
07:03:01.110 --> 07:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions they certainly can
 
07:03:04.190 --> 07:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to me thank you thank you okay
 
07:03:07.350 --> 07:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
next I'd call on Bob
 
07:03:12.150 --> 07:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
Susi who skull rather Bob Scully who
 
07:03:15.150 --> 07:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
represents energy Managers Association
 
07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I believe did I get
 
07:03:20.388 --> 07:03:20.398 align:start position:0%
that right Mr Scully uh no uh thank you
 
07:03:21.948 --> 07:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee for
 
07:03:23.628 --> 07:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Bob Scully and I
 
07:03:25.830 --> 07:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
represent the energy marketers
 
07:03:28.350 --> 07:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire okay I also
 
07:03:30.030 --> 07:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
represent two other groups today that
 
07:03:32.030 --> 07:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh present in oppos position
 
07:03:33.110 --> 07:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
at HB
 
07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
106 that is the um Propane Gas
 
07:03:38.548 --> 07:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
Association of New England and the New
 
07:03:41.270 --> 07:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Motor Transport Association
 
07:03:43.270 --> 07:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
the the commonality between three of
 
07:03:47.788 --> 07:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
them is the fossil fuels that we use um
 
07:03:49.430 --> 07:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
I would just like to explain if this
 
07:03:51.590 --> 07:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill was to move forward and pass as I
 
07:03:53.190 --> 07:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
look at these legislative findings what
 
07:03:54.670 --> 07:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
it would do to those three Industries in
 
07:03:55.868 --> 07:03:55.878 align:start position:0%
our state of New
 
07:04:00.310 --> 07:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so 65% of the homes and
 
07:04:02.270 --> 07:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire are heated
 
07:04:04.230 --> 07:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
either by heating oil or
 
07:04:07.590 --> 07:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
propane the remaining balance most of it
 
07:04:10.388 --> 07:04:10.398 align:start position:0%
is heated by natural gas which I do not
 
07:04:12.628 --> 07:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
represent the trucking
 
07:04:15.868 --> 07:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
industry delivers over 90% of all your
 
07:04:17.670 --> 07:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
goods and services in the state of New
 
07:04:19.868 --> 07:04:19.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's over 5,000 companies
 
07:04:23.270 --> 07:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
in our state most of them are small half
 
07:04:25.230 --> 07:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
of them are single truck drivers in our
 
07:04:27.670 --> 07:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so as I read the
 
07:04:30.750 --> 07:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
legislative findings on this bill and I
 
07:04:35.548 --> 07:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
take a look at on on the page one here
 
07:04:39.708 --> 07:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay line four it says Roman two a rapid
 
07:04:42.110 --> 07:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
shift in energy use May prevent the
 
07:04:44.750 --> 07:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
worst effects of climate change but even
 
07:04:46.750 --> 07:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
under best case scenario there'll be
 
07:04:48.830 --> 07:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
significant damage well what are we
 
07:04:50.548 --> 07:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
going to ship from how are you going to
 
07:04:53.548 --> 07:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
heat your home your business how are you
 
07:04:54.708 --> 07:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
going to get your products how are you
 
07:04:58.030 --> 07:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to drive your cars so first thing
 
07:05:00.910 --> 07:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
for you all to consider the second one
 
07:05:02.628 --> 07:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to take you right down to
 
07:05:05.190 --> 07:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
line six Roman 3 under the the
 
07:05:08.430 --> 07:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
legislative findings when it talks about
 
07:05:10.708 --> 07:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
costly and extensive adaptations to deal
 
07:05:12.510 --> 07:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
with the effects of climate change will
 
07:05:13.990 --> 07:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to be made to New Hampshire
 
07:05:15.670 --> 07:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and
 
07:05:18.270 --> 07:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
Industry I represent three Industries
 
07:05:20.190 --> 07:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
here today that if you would remove
 
07:05:22.150 --> 07:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels you would destroy in a
 
07:05:23.788 --> 07:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that represents
 
07:05:27.230 --> 07:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:32.750 --> 07:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
state line 11 Roman 5 under the findings
 
07:05:34.310 --> 07:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
says you will not be able basically
 
07:05:36.430 --> 07:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
you'll not be able to pass any of these
 
07:05:38.628 --> 07:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh additional costs onto the consumers
 
07:05:41.230 --> 07:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
well you tell me how that's going to
 
07:05:43.548 --> 07:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
work okay you can have an additional
 
07:05:45.388 --> 07:05:45.398 align:start position:0%
cost get rid of fossil fuels and not
 
07:05:47.030 --> 07:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
pass them on to the
 
07:05:49.750 --> 07:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
consumer if that was to move forward and
 
07:05:51.868 --> 07:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
that was to pass that these people at
 
07:05:53.468 --> 07:05:53.478 align:start position:0%
least on the energy side would probably
 
07:05:55.190 --> 07:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
not offer fuel in New Hampshire so you
 
07:05:56.628 --> 07:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
might get what you want with no fossil
 
07:05:58.670 --> 07:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
fuel but you won't heat your
 
07:06:01.868 --> 07:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
house um I will tell you this state of
 
07:06:04.230 --> 07:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont has passed maybe not exactly
 
07:06:06.070 --> 07:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
something like this but some similar
 
07:06:08.628 --> 07:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
legislation to try to recoup costs um
 
07:06:12.548 --> 07:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
last year um a lawsuit was filed early
 
07:06:14.548 --> 07:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
January I Believe by the American
 
07:06:16.468 --> 07:06:16.478 align:start position:0%
petroleum Institute and the US Chamber
 
07:06:19.590 --> 07:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
of Commerce to challenge the the law
 
07:06:22.150 --> 07:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
that passed in Vermont um so you can
 
07:06:23.590 --> 07:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
kindly I don't have that with me but you
 
07:06:26.628 --> 07:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
can look it up um I'm not an attorney
 
07:06:29.070 --> 07:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
but there are concerns with a similar
 
07:06:31.788 --> 07:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
type of legislation in our border state
 
07:06:34.150 --> 07:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm trying to be uh respectful of
 
07:06:36.388 --> 07:06:36.398 align:start position:0%
the time we just have three Industries
 
07:06:38.430 --> 07:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this would damage
 
07:06:40.150 --> 07:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
greatly if it was to move forward and
 
07:06:41.948 --> 07:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
for that reason I uh oppose this
 
07:06:48.948 --> 07:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:51.310 --> 07:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
same representative Corman has a
 
07:06:55.150 --> 07:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so um
 
07:06:56.430 --> 07:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that you don't know the
 
07:06:58.230 --> 07:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
particulars of the Vermont bill this
 
07:07:01.270 --> 07:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
bill just establishes a commission did
 
07:07:03.868 --> 07:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
the did the Vermont Bill do just that or
 
07:07:05.708 --> 07:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
did it go beyond that no the the Vermont
 
07:07:09.230 --> 07:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
the Vermont legislation went beyond
 
07:07:11.708 --> 07:07:11.718 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
07:07:13.868 --> 07:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
07:07:16.230 --> 07:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr Scully and move on to the next
 
07:07:17.788 --> 07:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
person who
 
07:07:21.750 --> 07:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
is and I hope I get this right Dan
 
07:07:24.030 --> 07:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
hberman of
 
07:07:27.590 --> 07:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
Laconia is that correct
 
07:07:35.468 --> 07:07:35.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:37.548 --> 07:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
three minutes please all right I'm on
 
07:07:37.558 --> 07:07:38.270 align:start position:0%
three minutes please all right I'm on
the

07:07:38.270 --> 07:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:07:41.230 --> 07:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
clock um my name's Dan huberman I'm a
 
07:07:44.590 --> 07:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
resident of lonia I'm a recent retired
 
07:07:47.230 --> 07:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
recently retired psychiatrist I'm
 
07:07:49.830 --> 07:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill I'd like to discuss
 
07:07:52.388 --> 07:07:52.398 align:start position:0%
the health effects of air pollution from
 
07:07:54.468 --> 07:07:54.478 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels both from burning fossil
 
07:07:57.430 --> 07:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
fuels and from climate induced changes
 
07:08:00.030 --> 07:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
which cause wildfires and we'll begin
 
07:08:01.830 --> 07:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the effects on my wife during the
 
07:08:04.590 --> 07:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
summer of 2023 there were enormous fires
 
07:08:08.030 --> 07:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
in Canada it is very likely that climate
 
07:08:09.830 --> 07:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
change was the major cause of these
 
07:08:12.070 --> 07:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
fires the smoke from the fire spread
 
07:08:14.788 --> 07:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
into New New Hampshire my wife is an
 
07:08:17.948 --> 07:08:17.958 align:start position:0%
athlete exercises 45 minutes a day but
 
07:08:20.590 --> 07:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
has asthma she was forced to stay
 
07:08:22.830 --> 07:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
indoors for days at a time as she had
 
07:08:25.750 --> 07:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
worsening wheezing when she went out
 
07:08:29.070 --> 07:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
outside on the worst days um this is not
 
07:08:31.590 --> 07:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
an uncommon scenario it knew New
 
07:08:33.310 --> 07:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our air quality has been
 
07:08:35.548 --> 07:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
improving but it's not good enough and
 
07:08:38.670 --> 07:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're also quite vulnerable to downwind
 
07:08:42.150 --> 07:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
effects um from from wildfires and from
 
07:08:45.270 --> 07:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
other states who whose uh air is not as
 
07:08:47.548 --> 07:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
good the total costs associated with
 
07:08:50.190 --> 07:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
man-made air pollution in New Hampshire
 
07:08:52.948 --> 07:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
has been estimated at over $3.8 billion
 
07:08:56.190 --> 07:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
dollar a year and the mortality um is
 
07:08:59.110 --> 07:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
about, 1300 pre premature deaths a year
 
07:09:03.948 --> 07:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
according to the um 200 17 Dees report
 
07:09:06.468 --> 07:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
another study from congressman papis and
 
07:09:10.070 --> 07:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
Congressman um kuster kuster in 20120
 
07:09:12.868 --> 07:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
indicated that 41% of premature deaths
 
07:09:15.190 --> 07:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
due to air pollution in New Hampshire
 
07:09:17.510 --> 07:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
could be eliminated with reduction in
 
07:09:20.510 --> 07:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels over 10 years exposure to
 
07:09:22.350 --> 07:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
brief periods of high levels of
 
07:09:25.150 --> 07:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
pollution such as these wildfires as
 
07:09:27.830 --> 07:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
well as long periods of exposure to low
 
07:09:30.708 --> 07:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
levels typically considered safe are not
 
07:09:32.070 --> 07:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
so safe
 
07:09:34.510 --> 07:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
air pollution from burning fossil fuel
 
07:09:38.868 --> 07:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
produces toxic chemicals in pm2.5 pm2.5
 
07:09:41.388 --> 07:09:41.398 align:start position:0%
are the very tiny particles which cannot
 
07:09:43.868 --> 07:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
be filtered by the respiratory system
 
07:09:45.708 --> 07:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
travel to every part of the body and
 
07:09:48.110 --> 07:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
affect heart and lung function these
 
07:09:50.548 --> 07:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
pollutants can both cause and worsen
 
07:09:53.030 --> 07:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
lung and heart disease and are also
 
07:09:54.910 --> 07:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic and have been linked to
 
07:09:57.948 --> 07:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
very specific cancers wood bearing from
 
07:10:00.868 --> 07:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
wildfires is even more toxic it's been
 
07:10:03.190 --> 07:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
described as the worst form of pollution
 
07:10:06.070 --> 07:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
that people are normally exposed to I'd
 
07:10:08.910 --> 07:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
also like to comment on my field mental
 
07:10:11.510 --> 07:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
health and air pollution Studies have
 
07:10:13.910 --> 07:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
linked both short-term exposure to high
 
07:10:16.150 --> 07:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
levels of these substances such as
 
07:10:19.388 --> 07:10:19.398 align:start position:0%
wildfires and longterm exposure to low
 
07:10:22.310 --> 07:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
levels to clinical episodes of
 
07:10:26.628 --> 07:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety schizophrenia autism

dementia such as Alzheimer's and
 
07:10:32.230 --> 07:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
suicidal behavior these um effects are
 
07:10:35.190 --> 07:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
surprisingly significant and range from
 
07:10:38.948 --> 07:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 45% increased risk in
 
07:10:41.510 --> 07:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
summary fossil fuels and wildfires emit
 
07:10:44.070 --> 07:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
toxin that toxins that cause multiple
 
07:10:46.990 --> 07:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
diseases the statistics two more
 
07:10:51.070 --> 07:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
sentences the St statistics and list of
 
07:10:53.190 --> 07:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
diseases reflect real people in their
 
07:10:55.750 --> 07:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
families who lives have been up ended
 
07:10:58.388 --> 07:10:58.398 align:start position:0%
this is Untold Misery the fossil fuel
 
07:11:00.388 --> 07:11:00.398 align:start position:0%
industry has known this for decades they
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
need to be held
 
07:11:05.230 --> 07:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
accountable thank you sir any questions
 
07:11:07.830 --> 07:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:10.430 --> 07:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
huberman representative bney has a
 
07:11:12.030 --> 07:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you chairman and thank
 
07:11:14.910 --> 07:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
you for uh for your um testimony uh you
 
07:11:16.548 --> 07:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned that pollutions coming from
 
07:11:19.270 --> 07:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
Canada and other states uh would you
 
07:11:21.230 --> 07:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
agree that it make more sense for some
 
07:11:22.990 --> 07:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
for legislation like this to be filed at
 
07:11:24.388 --> 07:11:24.398 align:start position:0%
the federal level more at the state
 
07:11:26.910 --> 07:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
level because they can hold Canada as
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
you said and the other states more
 
07:11:30.990 --> 07:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
accountable I I'm not an expert in in
 
07:11:32.150 --> 07:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
you you know those
 
07:11:35.628 --> 07:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
legal um events I know we're vulnerable
 
07:11:39.030 --> 07:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
to wildfires here and I know there can
 
07:11:44.110 --> 07:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
be uh air pollution here so I I'm not
 
07:11:46.468 --> 07:11:46.478 align:start position:0%
sure okay seeing no further questions
 
07:11:51.190 --> 07:11:51.200 align:start position:0%

himself good afternoon
 
07:12:03.830 --> 07:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Steven CLA um I passed out my
 
07:12:05.150 --> 07:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
resume if you're interested in my
 
07:12:07.990 --> 07:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
credentials um currently retired from a
 
07:12:09.468 --> 07:12:09.478 align:start position:0%
long career as a risk assessor
 
07:12:11.070 --> 07:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
evaluating impacts to human and
 
07:12:13.910 --> 07:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
ecological Health speak a little bit
 
07:12:17.270 --> 07:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
louder please okay yeah I'm softspoken
 
07:12:19.350 --> 07:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
my job was essentially to determine the
 
07:12:21.468 --> 07:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
relative risks of industrial missions on
 
07:12:23.910 --> 07:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
human health and Wildlife I worked with
 
07:12:25.750 --> 07:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
many states and many state federal and
 
07:12:28.708 --> 07:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
federal Regulatory Agencies I also work
 
07:12:30.468 --> 07:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
closely with many scientists who are
 
07:12:33.230 --> 07:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with climate models
 
07:12:35.590 --> 07:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the many different forcing V
 
07:12:37.150 --> 07:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
variables that were used to validate
 
07:12:39.868 --> 07:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
these models I'm here to uh voice strong
 
07:12:42.110 --> 07:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
opposition to HP 106 which wants to
 
07:12:43.788 --> 07:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
establish a commission to determine the
 
07:12:46.270 --> 07:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
monetary cost of climate damage to the
 
07:12:47.590 --> 07:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and the best
 
07:12:50.150 --> 07:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
means of recouping such costs so the
 
07:12:51.628 --> 07:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
first question that entered my mind upon
 
07:12:54.750 --> 07:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
reading the bill was what damage I have
 
07:12:57.590 --> 07:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
lived and worked in New Hampshire since
 
07:13:00.388 --> 07:13:00.398 align:start position:0%
1988 and I have not seen nor heard
 
07:13:03.350 --> 07:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
mention of any climate damage that
 
07:13:05.388 --> 07:13:05.398 align:start position:0%
resulted from fossil fuels through any
 
07:13:08.110 --> 07:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
industry nor have I heard of any climate
 
07:13:11.230 --> 07:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
damage through state or federal agencies
 
07:13:13.110 --> 07:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
that I have worked with I have not seen
 
07:13:15.388 --> 07:13:15.398 align:start position:0%
any damage from any non-existent rising
 
07:13:17.350 --> 07:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
of the ocean
 
07:13:19.990 --> 07:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
levels uh along the New Hampshire coast
 
07:13:21.350 --> 07:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
and though some have attempted to
 
07:13:22.750 --> 07:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
illustrate a warming Trend in New
 
07:13:25.070 --> 07:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
England I haven't seen any studies that
 
07:13:27.310 --> 07:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
are able to link any such Trends to the
 
07:13:29.628 --> 07:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
burning of fossil fuels none of the
 
07:13:32.590 --> 07:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
models constructed by the i p p ipcc
 
07:13:35.270 --> 07:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
have been correct nor have any realized
 
07:13:36.910 --> 07:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
any outcome that they were intended to
 
07:13:39.750 --> 07:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
predict to quote George box all models
 
07:13:42.670 --> 07:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
are wrong but some are useful secondly
 
07:13:44.310 --> 07:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
should this proposed commission assume
 
07:13:46.150 --> 07:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
that any change in the local New
 
07:13:47.628 --> 07:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire climate was somehow
 
07:13:50.310 --> 07:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for any purported damage to
 
07:13:52.388 --> 07:13:52.398 align:start position:0%
the environment how would the commission
 
07:13:54.310 --> 07:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
ascribe What proportion of the damage is
 
07:13:56.548 --> 07:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
attributable to fossil fuels versus What
 
07:13:58.788 --> 07:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
proportion is attributable from random
 
07:14:01.270 --> 07:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
or natural variability
 
07:14:02.510 --> 07:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
how would the commission go about
 
07:14:04.310 --> 07:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
estimating any cost to pay for this
 
07:14:06.868 --> 07:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
elusory damage how would the commission
 
07:14:09.670 --> 07:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
act as a soothsayer or profit and
 
07:14:12.510 --> 07:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
allocate costs needed for any future in
 
07:14:15.350 --> 07:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure adaptations this kind of
 
07:14:17.150 --> 07:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
thinking would be like trying to predict
 
07:14:18.990 --> 07:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
the outcome of a football game before
 
07:14:21.468 --> 07:14:21.478 align:start position:0%
the ball's even kicked off not to
 
07:14:23.150 --> 07:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
mention what the score might be during
 
07:14:25.548 --> 07:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
any particular quarter or which players
 
07:14:28.030 --> 07:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
might be involved in my experience
 
07:14:30.030 --> 07:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
speaking on the basis of a regional
 
07:14:33.230 --> 07:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
impact every attempt to allocate U
 
07:14:36.628 --> 07:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
mitigation or adaptation costs based on
 
07:14:39.468 --> 07:14:39.478 align:start position:0%
putative cause and effect scenarios
 
07:14:41.990 --> 07:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in either a legal or a
 
07:14:44.750 --> 07:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
political solution it was never based on
 
07:14:46.468 --> 07:14:46.478 align:start position:0%
an engineered solution that could be
 
07:14:49.788 --> 07:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
easily translated into objective costs
 
07:14:51.670 --> 07:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
finally the bill states that the the
 
07:14:53.590 --> 07:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
cost for climate damage and adaptation
 
07:14:56.628 --> 07:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
must be Equitable and not place an undue
 
07:14:59.628 --> 07:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
burden on citizens or the economy while
 
07:15:01.468 --> 07:15:01.478 align:start position:0%
I am 70 years old and I can tell you
 
07:15:03.230 --> 07:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
that should the commission get their way
 
07:15:07.030 --> 07:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
and somehow a identify any damages which
 
07:15:09.030 --> 07:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
really can't be attributable to fossil
 
07:15:13.388 --> 07:15:13.398 align:start position:0%
fuels and B somehow allocate costs U by
 
07:15:15.190 --> 07:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
seeing what estimates they have that
 
07:15:17.590 --> 07:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
might stick to the wall there will be
 
07:15:19.670 --> 07:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
indeed a very heavy price to pay for
 
07:15:22.510 --> 07:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
both the private citizen and the economy
 
07:15:26.030 --> 07:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to summarize my opinion
 
07:15:28.270 --> 07:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
is that this proposed bill is a moond
 
07:15:30.388 --> 07:15:30.398 align:start position:0%
doggle that is trying to hit your wagon
 
07:15:32.468 --> 07:15:32.478 align:start position:0%
to the successful policies and the
 
07:15:35.430 --> 07:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
failed predictions of the ipcc and I
 
07:15:37.628 --> 07:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time my opportunity
 
07:15:37.638 --> 07:15:39.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time my opportunity
to

07:15:39.590 --> 07:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:15:42.270 --> 07:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
speak thank you sir could you pronounce
 
07:15:45.150 --> 07:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
your last name for me again CLA CLA Mr
 
07:15:48.948 --> 07:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
CLA Dr CLA thank you for uh testifying
 
07:15:51.590 --> 07:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
here this afternoon uh representative
 
07:15:52.990 --> 07:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
schneller would like to ask you a
 
07:15:56.350 --> 07:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you chairman V uh and
 
07:16:01.788 --> 07:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
Dr CLA uh just to very simply put the uh
 
07:16:04.670 --> 07:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
term consensus was used in prior
 
07:16:07.948 --> 07:16:07.958 align:start position:0%
testimony um it sounds to me like
 
07:16:09.350 --> 07:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
throughout your testimony you're
 
07:16:11.590 --> 07:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that consensus is something
 
07:16:14.750 --> 07:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly have not arrived at and
 
07:16:18.430 --> 07:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
therefore uh in your scientific opinion
 
07:16:21.548 --> 07:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
we can't yet form conclusions that would
 
07:16:21.558 --> 07:16:22.468 align:start position:0%
we can't yet form conclusions that would
even

07:16:22.468 --> 07:16:22.478 align:start position:0%
even
 
07:16:25.270 --> 07:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
necessitate the objective of this
 
07:16:28.070 --> 07:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
purported commission that's correct yeah
 
07:16:31.150 --> 07:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
consensus is in science in my opinion
 
07:16:31.160 --> 07:16:32.190 align:start position:0%
consensus is in science in my opinion
thank

07:16:32.190 --> 07:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:16:34.670 --> 07:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Summers has a
 
07:16:37.388 --> 07:16:37.398 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
07:16:39.628 --> 07:16:39.638 align:start position:0%
you doctor for taking my question I have
 
07:16:42.868 --> 07:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
a I I see you have vast experience in
 
07:16:44.868 --> 07:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
this and vast education along with
 
07:16:47.430 --> 07:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
toxology and that as well so I'm I'm
 
07:16:50.750 --> 07:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
curious on a scientific basis um in in
 
07:16:53.548 --> 07:16:53.558 align:start position:0%
your educated opinion do you find
 
07:16:55.190 --> 07:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
temperatures and temperature changes
 
07:16:58.150 --> 07:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
climate change to be cyclical or does
 
07:17:00.388 --> 07:17:00.398 align:start position:0%
you find it being still on a upward
 
07:17:03.590 --> 07:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
Trend that is begin beginning at time in
 
07:17:05.788 --> 07:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
my opinion I don't see an upward Trend
 
07:17:07.948 --> 07:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
by my study of the data I mean cyclical
 
07:17:07.958 --> 07:17:08.750 align:start position:0%
by my study of the data I mean cyclical
is

07:17:08.750 --> 07:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:17:13.190 --> 07:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
seasonal but um I my analysis of all of
 
07:17:14.750 --> 07:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
the ipcc
 
07:17:17.910 --> 07:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
reports um there's as there's as much
 
07:17:20.590 --> 07:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
con as there is
 
07:17:20.600 --> 07:17:22.430 align:start position:0%
con as there is
pro

07:17:22.430 --> 07:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
pro
 
07:17:25.310 --> 07:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
yep Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
07:17:26.948 --> 07:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
07:17:30.468 --> 07:17:30.478 align:start position:0%
my question so um based on what you what
 
07:17:36.670 --> 07:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
you said said am I uh And to clarify if
 
07:17:39.750 --> 07:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
a commission was
 
07:17:41.830 --> 07:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
established what would you think would
 
07:17:46.270 --> 07:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
be gained by a commission uh you just
 
07:17:48.670 --> 07:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
said there's enough Pros as there are
 
07:17:50.430 --> 07:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
cons what would you think would be
 
07:17:52.628 --> 07:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
gained by a commission and what effect
 
07:17:55.070 --> 07:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
do you think it would have if one was
 
07:17:57.468 --> 07:17:57.478 align:start position:0%
held well I'm I'm opposing the
 
07:17:58.868 --> 07:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
commission because I don't think it
 
07:18:00.510 --> 07:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
would have any effect at all I don't
 
07:18:00.520 --> 07:18:01.708 align:start position:0%
would have any effect at all I don't
think

07:18:01.708 --> 07:18:01.718 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:18:05.270 --> 07:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think any decisions would go
 
07:18:09.788 --> 07:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
anywhere I mean the previous testimonies
 
07:18:15.628 --> 07:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:18.468 --> 07:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Swanson has a
 
07:18:22.468 --> 07:18:22.478 align:start position:0%
question for you uh Dr CLA thank you for
 
07:18:25.310 --> 07:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
your time uh Mr chair thank you for uh
 
07:18:27.868 --> 07:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
allowing me a question uh I'm looking
 
07:18:29.910 --> 07:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
over your resume and I see a lot of
 
07:18:34.388 --> 07:18:34.398 align:start position:0%
Toxicology and water quality and uh uh
 
07:18:36.990 --> 07:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
so you have considerable expertise in
 
07:18:40.868 --> 07:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
chemistry yeah I presume and also
 
07:18:45.110 --> 07:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
bacterial so forth uh do you have uh
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
training in meteorology or weather uh
 
07:18:50.548 --> 07:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that reading the ipcc
 
07:18:52.548 --> 07:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
report the intergovernmental panel on
 
07:18:55.948 --> 07:18:55.958 align:start position:0%
climate uh commission or climate control
 
07:18:57.590 --> 07:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
or I I'm not sure what the last SE is
 
07:19:01.708 --> 07:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
but any rate uh but are you applying
 
07:19:04.628 --> 07:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
your uh well you have a clear technical
 
07:19:05.990 --> 07:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
background but do you have a
 
07:19:06.000 --> 07:19:07.468 align:start position:0%
background but do you have a
meteorological

07:19:07.468 --> 07:19:07.478 align:start position:0%
meteorological
 
07:19:09.910 --> 07:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
background well I've taken courses of
 
07:19:12.110 --> 07:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
meteorology and I worked with
 
07:19:14.990 --> 07:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
meteorologists and Foresters and with
 
07:19:18.548 --> 07:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
many many different types of models that
 
07:19:23.310 --> 07:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
you have to use to predict um air roses
 
07:19:28.030 --> 07:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
and um plumes coming out of a stack so
 
07:19:29.948 --> 07:19:29.958 align:start position:0%
to speak so I'm familiar with all of the
 
07:19:33.510 --> 07:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
terms and I'm not a meteorologist
 
07:19:35.388 --> 07:19:35.398 align:start position:0%
but you don't you don't have to be a
 
07:19:38.230 --> 07:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
plumber to fix your own Plumbing so to
 
07:19:41.750 --> 07:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
speak okay thank you seeing no further
 
07:19:43.910 --> 07:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions we'll move along here next up
 
07:19:46.948 --> 07:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
is thank you laara
 
07:19:52.430 --> 07:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:55.430 --> 07:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman committee
 
07:19:58.510 --> 07:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
members and fellow citizens my name is
 
07:20:02.030 --> 07:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
Laura Magus and I have have lived in
 
07:20:05.708 --> 07:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
conquered here since
 
07:20:09.750 --> 07:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
1997 in 1990 I moved from Atlanta
 
07:20:13.590 --> 07:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
Georgia to Kean New Hampshire largely
 
07:20:17.750 --> 07:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
because I loved snow and uh cross
 
07:20:17.760 --> 07:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
because I loved snow and uh cross
country

07:20:19.510 --> 07:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
country
 
07:20:22.230 --> 07:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
skiing I dreamt of skiing
 
07:20:24.910 --> 07:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
outside uh my door in
 
07:20:27.948 --> 07:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
Winter once I got here I find there was
 
07:20:31.110 --> 07:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
not quite as much snow as I had had
 
07:20:36.388 --> 07:20:36.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:39.070 --> 07:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
Atlanta however for several years there
 
07:20:42.070 --> 07:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
was enough snow for me to
 
07:20:47.190 --> 07:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh some healthy exercise fun and
 
07:20:50.868 --> 07:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
ability to connect with others who had a
 
07:20:54.468 --> 07:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:57.750 --> 07:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
Winters I recall being disturbed a few
 
07:21:00.590 --> 07:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
years uh after I moved here by
 
07:21:03.310 --> 07:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
predictions that in not too long New
 
07:21:05.510 --> 07:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wi Winters would resemble
 
07:21:09.750 --> 07:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
those in Atlanta which I had found very
 
07:21:14.548 --> 07:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
boring I will say uh that the recent
 
07:21:16.388 --> 07:21:16.398 align:start position:0%
Winters here have to some extent
 
07:21:21.388 --> 07:21:21.398 align:start position:0%
reminded me of those in in uh my time in
 
07:21:24.750 --> 07:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
Atlanta which was more than a
 
07:21:27.910 --> 07:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
decade the predictions began to seem
 
07:21:31.548 --> 07:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
increasingly accurate as the winter grew
 
07:21:34.468 --> 07:21:34.478 align:start position:0%
Winters grew noticeably shorter and
 
07:21:37.430 --> 07:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
milder often snowy days were followed by
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
rain or warm weather which turned
 
07:21:43.910 --> 07:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
beautiful skiable snow to slush or
 
07:21:47.750 --> 07:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
ice while I am able to adjust to these
 
07:21:52.030 --> 07:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
changes I am sad to have to do
 
07:21:55.110 --> 07:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
so the world seems to me to be out of
 
07:21:59.110 --> 07:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
joint to borrow a phrase from William
 
07:22:01.948 --> 07:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
Shakespeare I am also seriously
 
07:22:04.070 --> 07:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
frustrated that New Hampshire has done
 
07:22:07.590 --> 07:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
so little to mitigate our contribution
 
07:22:11.190 --> 07:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh to climate change in this we are an
 
07:22:14.510 --> 07:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
outlaw outlier among our fellow States
 
07:22:15.868 --> 07:22:15.878 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
07:22:18.788 --> 07:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
England another frustration is that the
 
07:22:21.430 --> 07:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
creator of creators of these changes
 
07:22:24.868 --> 07:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
have not only caused climate disruption
 
07:22:28.548 --> 07:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
but have also covered up what they knew
 
07:22:30.830 --> 07:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
about it and what they know about it
 
07:22:33.548 --> 07:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
currently and of course many people like
 
07:22:36.948 --> 07:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
those in uh Los Angeles now are
 
07:22:40.070 --> 07:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing much more serious changes
 
07:22:43.388 --> 07:22:43.398 align:start position:0%
than I am here and it would appear that
 
07:22:47.350 --> 07:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies are promulgating
 
07:22:49.788 --> 07:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
disasters without being held to account
 
07:22:52.708 --> 07:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
for them and this is in my opinion a
 
07:22:52.718 --> 07:22:55.230 align:start position:0%
for them and this is in my opinion a
grave

07:22:55.230 --> 07:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:58.590 --> 07:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
Injustice thank you chairman Bose thank
 
07:23:00.788 --> 07:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
you uh I think at this point we're going
 
07:23:02.990 --> 07:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
to have to forego questions because we
 
07:23:04.510 --> 07:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
still have seven people who want to
 
07:23:08.308 --> 07:23:08.318 align:start position:0%
speak and only 20 minutes for that to
 
07:23:11.670 --> 07:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
happen so we'll move along next to
 
07:23:16.070 --> 07:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
margerie Pim from Main Street in eeping
 
07:23:16.080 --> 07:23:17.388 align:start position:0%
margerie Pim from Main Street in eeping
welcome

07:23:17.388 --> 07:23:17.398 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
marjerie one of my constituents yes
 
07:23:23.788 --> 07:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you for serving um and
 
07:23:27.150 --> 07:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all to for letting me speak my
 
07:23:28.948 --> 07:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
name is margerie
 
07:23:33.830 --> 07:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
PIM uh from eping and I am a retired
 
07:23:36.308 --> 07:23:36.318 align:start position:0%
public school
 
07:23:38.830 --> 07:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
teacher when I first started teaching in
 
07:23:41.190 --> 07:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on the second floor of my
 
07:23:42.670 --> 07:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
building which was a brand new building
 
07:23:45.308 --> 07:23:45.318 align:start position:0%
at the time there was no air
 
07:23:47.750 --> 07:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
conditioning and it got to the point
 
07:23:51.590 --> 07:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
after 17 years the district decided to
 
07:23:53.990 --> 07:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
put air conditioning units in because it
 
07:23:55.910 --> 07:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
was becoming
 
07:23:59.628 --> 07:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
unbearable um when the floods happened
 
07:24:02.868 --> 07:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
on in the Sea Coast Area a few years
 
07:24:06.110 --> 07:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
ago that caused several of my colleagues
 
07:24:08.270 --> 07:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
to have difficulties with their commute
 
07:24:10.590 --> 07:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
I don't I didn't teach in the district
 
07:24:12.430 --> 07:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast but
 
07:24:17.070 --> 07:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
nearby and um that has cost also if
 
07:24:20.270 --> 07:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:24.350 --> 07:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
where access is not possible due to
 
07:24:28.910 --> 07:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
flooding um that can cause the districts
 
07:24:31.308 --> 07:24:31.318 align:start position:0%
to have to reschedule there are costs to
 
07:24:34.948 --> 07:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
the entire Community when that has to
 
07:24:38.468 --> 07:24:38.478 align:start position:0%
happen um outside of the public school
 
07:24:40.910 --> 07:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
system now I continue to teach I teach
 
07:24:44.070 --> 07:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
knitting workshops and I rely on local
 
07:24:47.750 --> 07:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
farms for supply of local
 
07:24:50.110 --> 07:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
fiber wool in
 
07:24:53.110 --> 07:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
particular and Shepherds here in New
 
07:24:55.868 --> 07:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have told me that the window
 
07:24:58.548 --> 07:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
the time frame for the breeding
 
07:25:01.430 --> 07:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
season is tightening
 
07:25:04.070 --> 07:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
with extreme heat being the cause of
 
07:25:07.150 --> 07:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
when sheep are able to um
 
07:25:09.510 --> 07:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
conceive and the increase in days with
 
07:25:12.070 --> 07:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
extreme heat harms not only sheep but
 
07:25:17.308 --> 07:25:17.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:17.318 --> 07:25:19.150 align:start position:0%
 
produce

07:25:19.150 --> 07:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
produce
 
07:25:23.110 --> 07:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
um I also am involved um with fiber
 
07:25:25.990 --> 07:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
through strawberry Bank um where I I
 
07:25:28.990 --> 07:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
sell products in their gift shop
 
07:25:31.070 --> 07:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
strawberry bank is also destination for
 
07:25:34.548 --> 07:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
our dear school children for field trips
 
07:25:36.590 --> 07:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
in addition to tourists from other
 
07:25:39.590 --> 07:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
states strawberry bank has had trouble
 
07:25:43.868 --> 07:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
recently with water in um coming into
 
07:25:46.548 --> 07:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
their property and causing damage and
 
07:25:48.708 --> 07:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
increasing the financial burden of
 
07:25:53.150 --> 07:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:56.510 --> 07:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
history um which saddens
 
07:26:00.708 --> 07:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
me I believe that HB 106
 
07:26:04.548 --> 07:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
is designed to help us better understand
 
07:26:07.708 --> 07:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
the financial impacts that we don't
 
07:26:10.548 --> 07:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
exactly fully understand at this point
 
07:26:12.670 --> 07:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
because we haven't had such a
 
07:26:15.830 --> 07:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
commission um and I hope that that
 
07:26:17.510 --> 07:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
better understanding that would result
 
07:26:20.548 --> 07:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
from the studies of this proposed
 
07:26:23.910 --> 07:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
commission will help us to preserve our
 
07:26:28.150 --> 07:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
history our produce and our snow um so
 
07:26:29.830 --> 07:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we can all continue to enjoy what
 
07:26:33.990 --> 07:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has to offer thank
 
07:26:38.510 --> 07:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
you wow perfect way to go marjerie
 
07:26:43.030 --> 07:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay next up is Barb seed of Mountain
 
07:26:45.190 --> 07:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
Road I'm not sure what town but Barb is
 
07:26:49.628 --> 07:26:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:52.350 --> 07:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
herself it's Barb soued and that's
 
07:26:55.350 --> 07:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
Bradford at row Mountain
 
07:26:58.430 --> 07:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
Road and I am a retired Health
 
07:27:01.990 --> 07:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
researcher and my husband and I live on
 
07:27:06.070 --> 07:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
a a a really rural area where we have
 
07:27:08.590 --> 07:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
about 100 acres of
 
07:27:11.388 --> 07:27:11.398 align:start position:0%
forest and within that Forest we've
 
07:27:16.388 --> 07:27:16.398 align:start position:0%
created two 3 Acre Wildlife areas which
 
07:27:19.590 --> 07:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
is very nice and it's really helping for
 
07:27:21.948 --> 07:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
the Wildlife to come in and have a place
 
07:27:25.150 --> 07:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they do lots of different
 
07:27:28.510 --> 07:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
niches and we did that several years ago
 
07:27:31.150 --> 07:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
um but last
 
07:27:34.430 --> 07:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
year we started to notice that we having
 
07:27:38.388 --> 07:27:38.398 align:start position:0%
these plants that come in and they just
 
07:27:41.308 --> 07:27:41.318 align:start position:0%
cover all the other you know bushes and
 
07:27:43.388 --> 07:27:43.398 align:start position:0%
trees and stuff and just start killing
 
07:27:46.270 --> 07:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
them and we were told those are
 
07:27:49.270 --> 07:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
invasives and then invasiv are be
 
07:27:51.868 --> 07:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
invasives are becoming more and more
 
07:27:55.230 --> 07:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
common because of the shorter Summers
 
07:27:57.750 --> 07:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
and because the summers are hotter and
 
07:28:01.548 --> 07:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
drier and so we had to call in the big
 
07:28:04.510 --> 07:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
equipment and uh get the poison
 
07:28:07.230 --> 07:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
specialist to come and uh and and work
 
07:28:09.590 --> 07:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
with us and that's
 
07:28:12.510 --> 07:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
expensive but uh that's nothing compared
 
07:28:16.388 --> 07:28:16.398 align:start position:0%
to the cost that New Hampshire is facing
 
07:28:19.388 --> 07:28:19.398 align:start position:0%
centers for climate Integrity estimate
 
07:28:21.628 --> 07:28:21.638 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a down payment just
 
07:28:25.590 --> 07:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
the minimum down payment of a billion
 
07:28:29.230 --> 07:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
dollars to get prepared for rising sea
 
07:28:29.240 --> 07:28:30.788 align:start position:0%
dollars to get prepared for rising sea
levels

07:28:30.788 --> 07:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
levels
 
07:28:33.230 --> 07:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
and also for damages to
 
07:28:37.708 --> 07:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
flooding and to protect human health $1
 
07:28:40.830 --> 07:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
billion that's the down payment and if
 
07:28:44.150 --> 07:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
we don't do that the costs are going to
 
07:28:46.510 --> 07:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
be even higher as the time goes on
 
07:28:48.990 --> 07:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to get better and
 
07:28:51.350 --> 07:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be it's going to cause
 
07:28:54.830 --> 07:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
Devastation to uh Public Health to the
 
07:28:58.510 --> 07:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
environment to Farmers and to New
 
07:29:01.270 --> 07:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy
 
07:29:03.510 --> 07:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so you know this happened has
 
07:29:06.070 --> 07:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
happened before in another realm and
 
07:29:06.080 --> 07:29:07.230 align:start position:0%
happened before in another realm and
that's

07:29:07.230 --> 07:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:29:10.590 --> 07:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
tobacco and tobacco was brought to
 
07:29:13.270 --> 07:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
Justice because they knew they they had
 
07:29:15.388 --> 07:29:15.398 align:start position:0%
a harmful
 
07:29:17.788 --> 07:29:17.798 align:start position:0%
product and they were made to pay for
 
07:29:17.798 --> 07:29:18.510 align:start position:0%
product and they were made to pay for
those

07:29:18.510 --> 07:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
07:29:21.230 --> 07:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
harms and I don't see why we can't take
 
07:29:21.240 --> 07:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
harms and I don't see why we can't take
big

07:29:22.070 --> 07:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
big
 
07:29:26.708 --> 07:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
oil and and litigate and get some of the
 
07:29:30.350 --> 07:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh recoup some of these costs
 
07:29:32.430 --> 07:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
well why not let's do
 
07:29:35.388 --> 07:29:35.398 align:start position:0%
it otherwise we're really going to be
 
07:29:37.308 --> 07:29:37.318 align:start position:0%
pay paying for
 
07:29:40.788 --> 07:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
it so I support this commission and
 
07:29:42.468 --> 07:29:42.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Tony
 
07:29:44.708 --> 07:29:44.718 align:start position:0%

appreciate
 
07:29:58.708 --> 07:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
it okay next up is EMT Pim from eeping
 
07:30:03.190 --> 07:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
and Mr Pim I would like you to uh
 
07:30:05.628 --> 07:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
please give us new information don't
 
07:30:18.910 --> 07:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:22.070 --> 07:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
say hello my name is EMT Pim I'm a
 
07:30:25.150 --> 07:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
student at un and I study engineering
 
07:30:30.070 --> 07:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
physics um climate change is real um and
 
07:30:33.350 --> 07:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
it causes problems that's basically a
 
07:30:36.628 --> 07:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
given if you'd like to know what the
 
07:30:40.468 --> 07:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus is go to nasa.gov
 
07:30:42.990 --> 07:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
and in the search bar type climate
 
07:30:46.030 --> 07:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
change scientific consensus you'll find
 
07:30:49.830 --> 07:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
a page with a list of all of the VAR of
 
07:30:53.030 --> 07:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of various sources that have all
 
07:30:58.150 --> 07:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:01.110 --> 07:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
change since I I think we can all agree
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
that climate change is a
 
07:31:06.308 --> 07:31:06.318 align:start position:0%
problem the wise thing to do would be to
 
07:31:09.510 --> 07:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
assess the potential damages and impacts
 
07:31:11.750 --> 07:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
of our local
 
07:31:14.388 --> 07:31:14.398 align:start position:0%
area um and that's what this bill does I
 
07:31:17.430 --> 07:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh and you should too
 
07:31:17.440 --> 07:31:18.948 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh and you should too
thank

07:31:18.948 --> 07:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:31:21.388 --> 07:31:21.398 align:start position:0%
you thank you appreciate you coming down
 
07:31:25.070 --> 07:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
today and talking to us next up is Susan
 
07:31:27.910 --> 07:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
Richmond who I believe is from
 
07:31:32.030 --> 07:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
Durham and um she's speaking for herself
 
07:31:35.150 --> 07:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
and for someone who could not attend
 
07:31:37.468 --> 07:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
correct yes so I'm Susan Richmond of
 
07:31:40.990 --> 07:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
Durham I've lived there 38 uh 36 years
 
07:31:43.190 --> 07:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm also going to be speaking for
 
07:31:46.788 --> 07:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
Julia Steed mosson of pelum um so I'm a
 
07:31:48.308 --> 07:31:48.318 align:start position:0%
mother grandmother taught public school
 
07:31:51.590 --> 07:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
for 33 years so the reason I'm here is
 
07:31:53.070 --> 07:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
because my life has been dedicated to
 
07:31:55.590 --> 07:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
Preparing young people for the world and
 
07:31:57.868 --> 07:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
I hope that we are caring for the world
 
07:31:59.270 --> 07:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we're living leaving for our
 
07:32:02.110 --> 07:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
children um clearly people in this room
 
07:32:04.270 --> 07:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
and people testifying today have very
 
07:32:08.388 --> 07:32:08.398 align:start position:0%
different ideas about attribution and
 
07:32:11.350 --> 07:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
the reliability of models and predicting
 
07:32:13.388 --> 07:32:13.398 align:start position:0%
and with this random assortment of
 
07:32:15.230 --> 07:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
people that have decided to turn up
 
07:32:17.628 --> 07:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
today I hope that is not the end of your
 
07:32:19.388 --> 07:32:19.398 align:start position:0%
investigation of this issue and that you
 
07:32:22.590 --> 07:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
will more systematically say you know
 
07:32:25.868 --> 07:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
investigate H how can we trust a model
 
07:32:28.030 --> 07:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
how can we trust predictions but I'm
 
07:32:30.948 --> 07:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
going to talk today just about um what
 
07:32:32.948 --> 07:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry has to say
 
07:32:34.830 --> 07:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
because they compute a price for weather
 
07:32:38.270 --> 07:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
events that have happened um not putting
 
07:32:41.430 --> 07:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh determination on whether
 
07:32:43.910 --> 07:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
or not it was anthropogenic but just
 
07:32:46.308 --> 07:32:46.318 align:start position:0%
simply this is the cost and my
 
07:32:49.230 --> 07:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of 106 is that the outcome
 
07:32:50.948 --> 07:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
is not determined it's just an
 
07:32:53.990 --> 07:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really investigate what's
 
07:32:55.990 --> 07:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
the data what's out there what has been
 
07:32:57.670 --> 07:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
happening with weather and then
 
07:33:00.548 --> 07:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can do more work to
 
07:33:03.868 --> 07:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
investigate can we attribute it um can
 
07:33:07.308 --> 07:33:07.318 align:start position:0%
we ask for recompense from One Source or
 
07:33:10.510 --> 07:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
another anyhow um insurance premiums
 
07:33:12.110 --> 07:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're hearing in coastal regions have
 
07:33:14.230 --> 07:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
gone up as flooding becomes more
 
07:33:16.030 --> 07:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
frequent and
 
07:33:18.308 --> 07:33:18.318 align:start position:0%
extreme oh I'm sorry backing up I was
 
07:33:20.750 --> 07:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
driving to visit a friend in in adnoc uh
 
07:33:22.590 --> 07:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
and had to do two years ago when there
 
07:33:24.548 --> 07:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
were those terrible floods in the summer
 
07:33:26.270 --> 07:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I had to do a 45-minute detour
 
07:33:28.388 --> 07:33:28.398 align:start position:0%
because floods had destroyed the roads
 
07:33:30.388 --> 07:33:30.398 align:start position:0%
and then I heard about other where roads
 
07:33:32.468 --> 07:33:32.478 align:start position:0%
were destroyed rebuilt and then
 
07:33:34.948 --> 07:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
destroyed again and I knew well there's
 
07:33:37.308 --> 07:33:37.318 align:start position:0%
a cost to that and I began to wonder
 
07:33:39.190 --> 07:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
what was the cost for Connecticut Valley
 
07:33:40.910 --> 07:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
Farmers whose crops were lost in the
 
07:33:43.510 --> 07:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
flooding and whose soil was made unfit
 
07:33:45.230 --> 07:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
who paid for those losses what do they
 
07:33:48.590 --> 07:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
amount to and is our food supply then
 
07:33:51.468 --> 07:33:51.478 align:start position:0%
threatened with last year's flooding
 
07:33:53.868 --> 07:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
throughought this summer so the insur I
 
07:33:56.350 --> 07:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
asked my insurance broker about rates in
 
07:33:58.830 --> 07:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and was sent a wonderful
 
07:34:00.308 --> 07:34:00.318 align:start position:0%
article from new Hampshire Business
 
07:34:03.788 --> 07:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
Review June 19th 2024 which asks why are
 
07:34:06.270 --> 07:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
insurance rates climbing even in New
 
07:34:08.670 --> 07:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and ours are climbing less
 
07:34:11.270 --> 07:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
than in other states yay but the answer
 
07:34:14.070 --> 07:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
in term of homeowners insurance
 
07:34:16.670 --> 07:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
realtor.com cites climate change
 
07:34:19.830 --> 07:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
affected weather as a primary reason for
 
07:34:22.990 --> 07:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
increases everywhere climate risk is a
 
07:34:26.548 --> 07:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
big deal it can impact home values
 
07:34:28.990 --> 07:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance costs and the overall
 
07:34:31.308 --> 07:34:31.318 align:start position:0%
stability of a housing market the
 
07:34:33.110 --> 07:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
greatest risk for New Hampshire is
 
07:34:35.590 --> 07:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
flooding related to heavy rain and or
 
07:34:37.990 --> 07:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
melting snow events and to flooding
 
07:34:40.750 --> 07:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
along the coast as sea level rise
 
07:34:43.788 --> 07:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
continues so that's my testimony and now
 
07:34:46.788 --> 07:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
this is from Julia Steed mosson of pelum
 
07:34:48.868 --> 07:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and hers is
 
07:34:51.708 --> 07:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
regarding Inland flooding and I think uh
 
07:34:54.350 --> 07:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
reading hers will take about 20 seconds
 
07:34:56.868 --> 07:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
so my new home Lo quick please yeah my
 
07:34:58.350 --> 07:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
new home loan required me to get flood
 
07:34:59.830 --> 07:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
insurance though my family started Ed
 
07:35:01.308 --> 07:35:01.318 align:start position:0%
living here on the lake in
 
07:35:04.590 --> 07:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
1947 and it was never a requirement a
 
07:35:07.110 --> 07:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
few years ago FEMA re-evaluated flood
 
07:35:08.750 --> 07:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
issues and because New Hampshire slated
 
07:35:11.350 --> 07:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
for more intense storms and greater rain
 
07:35:14.548 --> 07:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
events FEMA has remapped areas of
 
07:35:16.868 --> 07:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
potential flooding given the Myriad of
 
07:35:19.150 --> 07:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
climate related disasters FEMA is
 
07:35:21.430 --> 07:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
running out of money and so to be
 
07:35:22.990 --> 07:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
proactive and get more money to handle
 
07:35:23.000 --> 07:35:23.788 align:start position:0%
proactive and get more money to handle
these

07:35:23.788 --> 07:35:23.798 align:start position:0%
these
 
07:35:26.350 --> 07:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
tragedies last year I was required to
 
07:35:30.070 --> 07:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
pay $860 in flood insurance that I never
 
07:35:32.308 --> 07:35:32.318 align:start position:0%
had to buy before okay and thank you so
 
07:35:34.430 --> 07:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
much for your time everyone and and for
 
07:35:35.868 --> 07:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
the work you're doing on this important
 
07:35:37.948 --> 07:35:37.958 align:start position:0%
topic thank you for coming over from
 
07:35:40.990 --> 07:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
Durham to talk to us today next up will
 
07:35:53.708 --> 07:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:56.270 --> 07:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
herself hi I'm Katherine um I'm from
 
07:35:58.270 --> 07:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
Windom and I'm a junior at Bowden
 
07:36:00.150 --> 07:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
College studying Earth and ocean graphic
 
07:36:03.270 --> 07:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
science um and it's quite clear that
 
07:36:05.270 --> 07:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
human burning of fossil fuels is causing
 
07:36:08.030 --> 07:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
increase in greenhouse gases which is
 
07:36:10.230 --> 07:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
causing increased temperature and a lot
 
07:36:12.868 --> 07:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
of um climate related disasters all over
 
07:36:15.308 --> 07:36:15.318 align:start position:0%
the world and in New Hampshire too and
 
07:36:17.150 --> 07:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire climate assessment
 
07:36:19.150 --> 07:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
report found that New Hampshire is
 
07:36:21.990 --> 07:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
facing infrastructure damage um from
 
07:36:25.430 --> 07:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
flooding and severe storms and sea level
 
07:36:28.110 --> 07:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
rise um and agricultural losses and
 
07:36:31.190 --> 07:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
public health expenses attributed to um
 
07:36:35.350 --> 07:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and climate change um so I
 
07:36:37.750 --> 07:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we are
 
07:36:40.190 --> 07:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
looking into the extent of these damages
 
07:36:42.468 --> 07:36:42.478 align:start position:0%
and charging the fossil fuel industry
 
07:36:43.910 --> 07:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
for them because they're responsible
 
07:36:45.548 --> 07:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
instead of putting the burden on the
 
07:36:48.190 --> 07:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
state and the taxpayers um and I know
 
07:36:49.830 --> 07:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's been some questions about the
 
07:36:51.788 --> 07:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
extent of these damages among committee
 
07:36:53.590 --> 07:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
members so I think it really makes sense
 
07:36:55.468 --> 07:36:55.478 align:start position:0%
to do this study so we can find out what
 
07:36:58.628 --> 07:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
they are um and chairman bza is
 
07:37:00.190 --> 07:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have the tallies of
 
07:37:01.868 --> 07:37:01.878 align:start position:0%

07:37:46.948 --> 07:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
for considering it thank you one second
 
07:37:48.948 --> 07:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos could I please ask a
 
07:37:51.868 --> 07:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Wendy Thomas
 
07:37:53.868 --> 07:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um thank you for
 
07:37:56.510 --> 07:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
being here and um it's wonderful to see
 
07:38:00.230 --> 07:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
youth involved in this um
 
07:38:02.910 --> 07:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
on related to that in your opinion
 
07:38:05.110 --> 07:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
because you you are a lot younger than
 
07:38:07.030 --> 07:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
many of the people in this room myself
 
07:38:09.868 --> 07:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
included why do you think so many people
 
07:38:12.388 --> 07:38:12.398 align:start position:0%
are afraid to recognize climate change
 
07:38:14.910 --> 07:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
is happening and that it is a threat to
 
07:38:17.750 --> 07:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
our lives health and economy what's your
 
07:38:20.510 --> 07:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
perspective on that I think that the
 
07:38:23.670 --> 07:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry has put a lot of
 
07:38:26.510 --> 07:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
money and Research into confusing people
 
07:38:28.548 --> 07:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
and following the similar tactics that
 
07:38:31.270 --> 07:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
the tobacco IND is she used to like
 
07:38:33.070 --> 07:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
confuse the message of the harms of
 
07:38:35.708 --> 07:38:35.718 align:start position:0%
smoking and they've been very effective
 
07:38:37.990 --> 07:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
in confusing the public and the policy
 
07:38:40.788 --> 07:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
makers thank you very much thank you so
 
07:38:44.110 --> 07:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you next up is Nick
 
07:38:49.750 --> 07:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:03.350 --> 07:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:04.990 --> 07:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
hey good afternoon nice to see you today
 
07:39:06.708 --> 07:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
I'm Nick coff I'm a senior attorney with
 
07:39:08.788 --> 07:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
the conservation law Foundation um I
 
07:39:10.070 --> 07:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be here
 
07:39:12.788 --> 07:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
today uh I'm here in support of HP
 
07:39:16.070 --> 07:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
106 um because climate damage is and
 
07:39:17.670 --> 07:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
will continue to cause significant
 
07:39:19.910 --> 07:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
financial costs to the state the
 
07:39:22.150 --> 07:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee should pass HP 106 and
 
07:39:23.788 --> 07:39:23.798 align:start position:0%
establish a commission to study the
 
07:39:26.388 --> 07:39:26.398 align:start position:0%
issue already environmental change is
 
07:39:27.868 --> 07:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
harming New Hampshire's economy in a lot
 
07:39:29.948 --> 07:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
of ways and you know we can witness it
 
07:39:32.150 --> 07:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
very easily um it's harming our winter
 
07:39:33.788 --> 07:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
tourism and Recreation
 
07:39:35.510 --> 07:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
Industries um average winter
 
07:39:36.990 --> 07:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
temperatures have increased several
 
07:39:38.990 --> 07:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
degrees over the past Century which has
 
07:39:40.628 --> 07:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
resulted in fewer snow cover days and
 
07:39:42.910 --> 07:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
earlier ice out you know I'm I'm 38
 
07:39:44.628 --> 07:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
years old I grew up in nearby Maine and
 
07:39:46.190 --> 07:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
I witnessed it with my own eyes just
 
07:39:48.110 --> 07:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
shorter Winters warmer Winters you know
 
07:39:49.708 --> 07:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
fewer days to enjoy the the snow and the
 
07:39:52.510 --> 07:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
winter here um these shorter and warmer
 
07:39:54.190 --> 07:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
Winters have major financial
 
07:39:55.868 --> 07:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
implications for our ski and
 
07:39:58.430 --> 07:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling Industries um for those
 
07:40:00.830 --> 07:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
enjoy ice fish fishing um it's it's big
 
07:40:03.150 --> 07:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
detriment to them um you know we also
 
07:40:05.350 --> 07:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
witnessed climate damage on the Sea
 
07:40:07.990 --> 07:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
Coast um sea level rises increases the
 
07:40:09.868 --> 07:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
frequency of coastal flooding which
 
07:40:12.350 --> 07:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
causes infrastructure property damage um
 
07:40:13.830 --> 07:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
we already have seen this a lot over the
 
07:40:15.670 --> 07:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
past few years last year and um in
 
07:40:17.868 --> 07:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
Hampton there was severe flooding in
 
07:40:19.590 --> 07:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
Hampton which caused a lot of damage to
 
07:40:21.830 --> 07:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
properties and businesses um you know
 
07:40:23.110 --> 07:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
we've also seen climate damage our
 
07:40:25.430 --> 07:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
Public Health in many ways um increased
 
07:40:27.430 --> 07:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
temperature increases the risk of vector
 
07:40:30.030 --> 07:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
born illnesses like Lyme disease um West
 
07:40:31.110 --> 07:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
now virus
 
07:40:34.030 --> 07:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
Etc you know given all these costs that
 
07:40:35.430 --> 07:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're already experiencing that we're
 
07:40:36.868 --> 07:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
expected to experience over the next few
 
07:40:39.070 --> 07:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
years we need a commission to start
 
07:40:41.150 --> 07:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
studying and quantifying these costs and
 
07:40:43.628 --> 07:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
to determine how to adapt to them um I
 
07:40:45.150 --> 07:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it hurts to to at least
 
07:40:46.750 --> 07:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
study the issue there's no there's no
 
07:40:49.150 --> 07:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
harm in doing that and uh you know if we
 
07:40:51.190 --> 07:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
start if we don't plan for this issue
 
07:40:52.150 --> 07:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're only going to make the problem
 
07:40:55.110 --> 07:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
worse by leading to even higher costs um
 
07:40:56.628 --> 07:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
for the state's economy and and public
 
07:40:59.910 --> 07:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
health down the road um you know and
 
07:41:01.350 --> 07:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
additionally to reduce costs to
 
07:41:03.270 --> 07:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from this this major issue we
 
07:41:04.708 --> 07:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
need to study the best means to recoup
 
07:41:07.270 --> 07:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
those costs um and you know I think
 
07:41:08.750 --> 07:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
exploring different ways to recoup those
 
07:41:10.270 --> 07:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
costs it's really in line with New
 
07:41:12.910 --> 07:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's fiscal conservatism I mean
 
07:41:15.110 --> 07:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just focusing on on uh legal
 
07:41:17.350 --> 07:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
damages it focuses on insurance bonding
 
07:41:18.708 --> 07:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know any ways to save money for
 
07:41:21.430 --> 07:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from these costs uh they're
 
07:41:24.628 --> 07:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
damaging the economy um so in conclusion
 
07:41:26.070 --> 07:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know I urge the commission to vote
 
07:41:28.230 --> 07:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
for HP 106 uh we need to study this
 
07:41:29.788 --> 07:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
issue to study the financial cost of
 
07:41:32.190 --> 07:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
climate damage uh to help us adapt and
 
07:41:34.590 --> 07:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
and please out to pass for this bill uh
 
07:41:35.708 --> 07:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and happy to
 
07:41:36.750 --> 07:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
answer your
 
07:41:39.030 --> 07:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
07:41:42.708 --> 07:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
you representative parshall has
 
07:41:44.788 --> 07:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
one thank you chair and thank you for
 
07:41:48.150 --> 07:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
being here tonight um Can Can you
 
07:41:51.670 --> 07:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
estimate any uh potential uh hazards to
 
07:41:53.830 --> 07:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
our our native agriculture such as our
 
07:41:56.468 --> 07:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
Maple industry and would you consider
 
07:41:59.190 --> 07:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's a general threat to our starability
 
07:42:00.750 --> 07:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
feed ourselves if we do not take any
 
07:42:02.868 --> 07:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
action yeah absolutely I mean um you
 
07:42:04.628 --> 07:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
know with with our maple syrup industry
 
07:42:06.628 --> 07:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
in particular I mean we we're seeing
 
07:42:09.708 --> 07:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
much shorter sugaring Seasons um you
 
07:42:11.110 --> 07:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
know I actually when I was when I was a
 
07:42:12.830 --> 07:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
kid I worked on a maple sugar farm you
 
07:42:14.868 --> 07:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
know in high school and we would tap the
 
07:42:17.070 --> 07:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
trees you know March April you know now
 
07:42:19.230 --> 07:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
we're now they're doing it in February
 
07:42:21.590 --> 07:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
even January because you know the the
 
07:42:23.388 --> 07:42:23.398 align:start position:0%
the winters are so much warmer so yeah
 
07:42:26.030 --> 07:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that impact our uh Maple
 
07:42:27.868 --> 07:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
sugaring industry and you know it's it's
 
07:42:30.150 --> 07:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
impacting other agriculture Industries
 
07:42:30.160 --> 07:42:32.868 align:start position:0%
impacting other agriculture Industries
as

07:42:32.868 --> 07:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:35.628 --> 07:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
well all right thank you very much and
 
07:42:39.388 --> 07:42:39.398 align:start position:0%
our last speaker of the day is John Gage
 
07:42:39.398 --> 07:42:43.910 align:start position:0%
our last speaker of the day is John Gage
from

07:42:43.910 --> 07:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:46.430 --> 07:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
Windam and like all other speakers Mr
 
07:42:48.750 --> 07:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
Gage you have three minutes okay thank
 
07:42:48.760 --> 07:43:01.830 align:start position:0%
Gage you have three minutes okay thank
you

07:43:01.830 --> 07:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:03.190 --> 07:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and committee for
 
07:43:05.910 --> 07:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony I support this
 
07:43:08.910 --> 07:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
bill um I think we should look at this
 
07:43:11.110 --> 07:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
similar to what the state did for pasas
 
07:43:14.070 --> 07:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
we had an industry come in that polluted
 
07:43:16.708 --> 07:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
um it knew that pollution was going to
 
07:43:19.030 --> 07:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
cause a problem and the state has taken
 
07:43:21.468 --> 07:43:21.478 align:start position:0%
action and we're we're getting money
 
07:43:24.270 --> 07:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
from the industry to help cover the cost
 
07:43:27.230 --> 07:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers and families from that
 
07:43:29.910 --> 07:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous pollution um
 
07:43:31.750 --> 07:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have climate pollution from fossil
 
07:43:34.430 --> 07:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
fuels and this is exactly the same
 
07:43:38.030 --> 07:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
scenario we need to hold the business an
 
07:43:40.190 --> 07:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
industry accountable for a pollution
 
07:43:42.190 --> 07:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
that it knew was going to cause problems
 
07:43:45.990 --> 07:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the future and is now costing us so
 
07:43:47.788 --> 07:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
there is scientific consensus about this
 
07:43:51.230 --> 07:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
issue um the ipcc report was quoted a
 
07:43:52.468 --> 07:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
couple times
 
07:43:55.308 --> 07:43:55.318 align:start position:0%
but uh the the P things that were pulled
 
07:43:57.830 --> 07:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
out of it were not given the proper
 
07:44:00.830 --> 07:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
context uh the summary of the six
 
07:44:03.468 --> 07:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
assessment report from the ipcc is says
 
07:44:04.910 --> 07:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
the conclusions are
 
07:44:07.190 --> 07:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
incontrovertible greenhouse gases from
 
07:44:09.190 --> 07:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel pollution are changing the
 
07:44:12.708 --> 07:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
climate this is leading to Major costs
 
07:44:15.150 --> 07:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
damages and losses across the world
 
07:44:18.230 --> 07:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
including in New Hampshire um even the
 
07:44:19.388 --> 07:44:19.398 align:start position:0%
oil and
 
07:44:23.430 --> 07:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
gas industry agrees with this uh the
 
07:44:25.548 --> 07:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
side of the sheet that I handed out has
 
07:44:29.150 --> 07:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
exons climate models from 1982
 
07:44:31.830 --> 07:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
they estimated the CO2 rise and the
 
07:44:35.430 --> 07:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
subsequent temperature rise from that um
 
07:44:38.150 --> 07:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
passed from now into the future and
 
07:44:41.548 --> 07:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
they're within about 5% of uh where we
 
07:44:44.468 --> 07:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
are today they knew decades ago their
 
07:44:46.948 --> 07:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
pollution would continue to increase
 
07:44:48.948 --> 07:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
under their policy scenarios around the
 
07:44:52.948 --> 07:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
world and that it was going to cause
 
07:44:55.750 --> 07:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
damages these are costing us
 
07:44:58.110 --> 07:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
now the thing that irks me is this was a
 
07:45:01.788 --> 07:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
two-faced game by an industry
 
07:45:03.910 --> 07:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the back of that
 
07:45:06.628 --> 07:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
sheet you'll see the major oil and gas
 
07:45:09.468 --> 07:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
players all agree with the scientific
 
07:45:11.628 --> 07:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
consensus about the problem of
 
07:45:13.308 --> 07:45:13.318 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas pollution from fossil
 
07:45:16.750 --> 07:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
fuels and the threat to uh many aspects
 
07:45:20.868 --> 07:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
of the way we live and nature and yet
 
07:45:24.110 --> 07:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
they also played a two-face game because
 
07:45:26.270 --> 07:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to accepting the science
 
07:45:29.788 --> 07:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
they funded front groups and
 
07:45:32.388 --> 07:45:32.398 align:start position:0%
misinformation which has manipulated the
 
07:45:34.350 --> 07:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
conversation about climate change in our
 
07:45:37.388 --> 07:45:37.398 align:start position:0%
society for over a
 
07:45:40.350 --> 07:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
decade so we're being tricked and I'm
 
07:45:42.708 --> 07:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
irked by being tricked and this is not
 
07:45:45.830 --> 07:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
just a small trick this is changing the
 
07:45:48.510 --> 07:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
chemical and physical properties of the
 
07:45:51.070 --> 07:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
earth that we live on in ways that will
 
07:45:53.590 --> 07:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
that are unrecoverable and are we are
 
07:45:53.600 --> 07:45:54.910 align:start position:0%
that are unrecoverable and are we are
losing

07:45:54.910 --> 07:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
losing
 
07:45:56.830 --> 07:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
things they knew this was going to
 
07:45:59.628 --> 07:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
happen economists call these external
 
07:46:03.030 --> 07:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
costs their costs of producing or using
 
07:46:04.628 --> 07:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
a good that are not reflected in the
 
07:46:07.708 --> 07:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:09.868 --> 07:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
good okay I want to thank you I have one
 
07:46:13.030 --> 07:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
more point I there's three states that
 
07:46:15.190 --> 07:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
have passed legislation in the last year
 
07:46:19.788 --> 07:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
to do this um New York Vermont and Maine
 
07:46:21.468 --> 07:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court just ruled
 
07:46:24.350 --> 07:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday that Hawaii can go forward
 
07:46:26.388 --> 07:46:26.398 align:start position:0%
with its lawsuits against the fossil
 
07:46:28.548 --> 07:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
fuel industry for the damages that it
 
07:46:31.270 --> 07:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
has recently incurred other states are
 
07:46:34.350 --> 07:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
collecting money they're going to be
 
07:46:36.868 --> 07:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
getting compensated and helping their
 
07:46:39.350 --> 07:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
voters um shoulder the burden of these
 
07:46:41.468 --> 07:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
damages and if New Hampshire doesn't get
 
07:46:43.868 --> 07:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
its fair share of money we're going to
 
07:46:47.308 --> 07:46:47.318 align:start position:0%
be paying not only for the damages but
 
07:46:49.868 --> 07:46:49.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to help other states recover
 
07:46:51.430 --> 07:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
and getting nothing for ourselves so
 
07:46:53.910 --> 07:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
please support this Bill thank you very
 
07:46:56.990 --> 07:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
much we have run up against
 
07:47:00.350 --> 07:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
our uh time limit for the use of this
 
07:47:03.788 --> 07:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
room so we have to call this to a close
 
07:47:06.230 --> 07:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
so I just want report that he put in
 
07:47:10.548 --> 07:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
good testimony that's it okay so uh I
 
07:47:12.708 --> 07:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
recognize Vice chair Thomas yeah thank
 
07:47:14.430 --> 07:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh just for the record
 
07:47:15.990 --> 07:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
although he did he wasn't here verbally
 
07:47:19.510 --> 07:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
to testify uh representative Julius soti
 
07:47:22.628 --> 07:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
gave a written um testimony uh in
 
07:47:25.308 --> 07:47:25.318 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
07:47:28.070 --> 07:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill so with that we will question
 
07:47:30.150 --> 07:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative part
 
07:47:32.750 --> 07:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
Mar thank you uh is it possible get
 
07:47:36.990 --> 07:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
copies of the this um uh letter and also
 
07:47:40.510 --> 07:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
somebody earlier referenced was a sonunu
 
07:47:42.948 --> 07:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
oh thank you senu referenced a bunch of
 
07:47:45.150 --> 07:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
information that he submitted will that
