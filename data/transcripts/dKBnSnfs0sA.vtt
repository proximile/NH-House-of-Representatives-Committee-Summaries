00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
madam chairman of adding the date of
 
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 align:start position:0%
voter registration to
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%

checklist
 
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
so all it does is add the date that the
 
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
voter registered
 
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
and nothing else
 
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.790 align:start position:0%
and nothing else
question

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
if you know since this is not your bill
 
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
is the intent for this to be retroactive
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
or forward-looking
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
they already have the information so i
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's retroactive it's just
 
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.550 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's retroactive it's just
available

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 align:start position:0%

representative
um

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
is there what is the reason for this
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
bill of uh of needing to know the
 
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
when a person registered to vote yeah i
 
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
can't speak exactly for the sponsor but
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh i do believe it gives a more complete
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
um picture of the voter as a whole um so
 
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know is this a new voter is it they
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
just move here right um you know as a as
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
we campaign i would like to know if
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
somebody lived in the neighborhood for
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
two days or 20 years
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh no i don't believe so and we did
 
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
consult all right we basically i know
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
the sponsor did consult with the
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office on this
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
because the um i believe he has an
 
00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
amendment coming forward um because i
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
think it's actually might be in the
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
wrong section
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
but i know he did speak with the
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
secretary state's office about this and
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
this information is available in most
 
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
states so i would i would
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
i don't see how that would be
 
00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.149 align:start position:0%
i don't see how that would be
confidential

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:59.030 align:start position:0%
confidential
further

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
it address questions
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
either within the district or from one
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
district to another be
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
of some interest
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from ward one suddenly
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
moves forward
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think to get to that point i
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
mean you're right it would be nice to
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
know that sort of things um but
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
the reality is is when you move from one
 
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
voting page to another you're a newly
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
registered voter in that in that area so
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly quite sure the point of
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
your question but if you want to put the
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
more information you want to make
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
available that is not let's call it
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
personally invasive
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
i would i'm supportive of that because
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none so thank you
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%

about this bill and he told me that this
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
happens more often than people realize
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%

that was applying for a grant and they
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
realized that this fish and game club
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
had made
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
going into uh to packs or political
 
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.389 align:start position:0%
going into uh to packs or political
campaigns

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
campaigns
um

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
let's see uh
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can't go very deep into a political
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
discussion without constituents uh
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
hearing without with constituents
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
without hearing we have to get the dirty
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
money out of out of the elections and
 
00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.430 align:start position:0%
money out of out of the elections and
that's

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
when you when you're taking taxpayer
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
money and putting it into an election
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's real dirty for me
 
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.829 align:start position:0%
that's real dirty for me
that

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is about quid
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
pro quo it's dirty money and we need to
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
while discussing this bill with
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues the question of first
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
amendment rights has come up
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
so i asked our colleague from windham
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire superior court uh his and his
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
response was they gave up their first
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
amendment rights when they took the
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money uh there is an amendment
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
that i had drafted that uh that expands
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
this bill a little bit but uh that's for
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
later and uh
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
no actually representative love why
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't you um
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien as has
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that she will introduce
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment when we are executing the
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
bill so why don't you
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%

amendment done while we're hearing the
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
bill it's frankly i think much more
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
useful for the committee than getting it
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
when we exec
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay um let me
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
pull it out here
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
and what what it does is uh you know it
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
expands it a little bit uh to uh
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
to any person or business entity that

able to make any donation i i did not
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
think of it and i i'd welcome enough an
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix that up okay
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative taking the question
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
you did address the on the state level
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
the potential of violating
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
the first amendment right of the
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
individual uh
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
with the business
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that federal
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
law has ruled on this before too and and
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
found that there could be a potential
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
first amendment right
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
violation to restrict
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
an activity like this
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
was that brought up or when you did your
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
research was any
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
my research was uh just uh
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
asking um you know the representative
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
from windham and uh you know i uh
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
the the man knows a little bit about law
 
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
the the man knows a little bit about law
so

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
i i took his word as
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh his
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
so i i have a
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
i think very highly representative lynn
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
on this issue um wouldn't
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we have to like structure this
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
to where it was a part of state
 
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
to where it was a part of state
contracts

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
or because then i couldn't think there
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
might be a first amendment violation i
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand because i've done
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
government contracts before and there's
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
all sorts of stipulations in there for
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
everything that you can imagine
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
but they're part of the contract we need
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
to make it a part of the actual contract
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
or grant or is this just do we have the
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
authority to do something sweeping like
 
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
authority to do something sweeping like
this

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.950 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question uh i guess we
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
could uh you know what it did
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
it uh you know having having this having
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
this in statute and on the uh grant
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
alone or subsidy application uh would
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
certainly uh suffice
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
further questions i have a question
 
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.430 align:start position:0%
further questions i have a question
um

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
let's let's take
 
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.669 align:start position:0%
let's let's take
take

00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
i was going to say let's take a look at
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
something that's non-controversial but
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that's non-controversial
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to go there anyways
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
let's say my
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
old grasmere town hall
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
the restoration of the grasmere town
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
hall has got a volunteer
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
board that's been established to accept
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
donations to help fund the restoration
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
and this board also receives an l-chip
 
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.110 align:start position:0%
and this board also receives an l-chip
grant

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that would be state funds right so is
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
that organization now prohibited from
 
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.990 align:start position:0%
that organization now prohibited from
lobbying

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.789 align:start position:0%
lobbying
the

00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
organization that decides who gets the
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
l-chip grants or is that board now
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
prohibited from donating any money to a
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
flyer to all representatives in support
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
of the l-chip program
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i don't believe
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
they're prohibited right now um you know
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%

group and everybody in that group does
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%

the taxpayers don't want their money
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
okay further questions
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative lane um thank you madam
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you representative
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
my question would is this going to apply
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
to entities that get sba loans
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
because most small business a lot of
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
small businesses in this state get sba
 
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.190 align:start position:0%
small businesses in this state get sba
loans

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
and that's federal that's federal money
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
distributed by the banks and so and
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different loan programs
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
not just related to covid
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
that are also state programs
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
so any business that gets one of these
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
loans is not going to be able
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
if it's direct taxpayer money which an
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
sba loan isn't it's the bank making the
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
loan um you know that that's different
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
well the money they're just they're just
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
backed by the state or the federal
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
government okay it's not it's not actual
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds that are going to the
 
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds that are going to the
loan

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question follow-up
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the money to the sba is coming from our
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
tax dollars though so if they have to
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
back that up that is coming from my tax
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
dollars correct and that's federal tax
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
dollars that's this is state okay that
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
this is just addressing state okay
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
why didn't you include non-profits in
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
this there are a lot of non-profits that
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
take millions and millions of state
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
contracts and then go and shove it into
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
packs and run campaigns that's why it
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
says any entity um i believe
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think it says it says business entity
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about channels i have a
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
says any person business or business
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%

the election law committee for the
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
record my name is ellen reed i represent
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
rockingham 17
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
newmarket and new fields i think i feel
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
here we go all right
 
00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
here we go all right
so

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
has been before you a few times it
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
actually passed in 2020 and was one of
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
those many unfortunate uh
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
casualties of the mass tabling event in
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
the senate um it was before you in 2021
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
and based on the report in the house
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
calendar there was a misinterpretation
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain that in a bit
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
but it was not voted on by the house so
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's before you again because
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
there was no uh restriction on uh
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
introducing it again
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
the previous versions and if you want to
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
just look at research from our committee
 
00:28:55.919 --> 00:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
just look at research from our committee
researchers

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're on
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
this particular bill so
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
if committee members want to refer to
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
that if they have it that would be fine
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the previous version of the bill i
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
had the existing paragraph that exists
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
in rsa
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
that applies to labor unions
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on labor unions
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
campaign donations
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then i added an identical paragraph
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain why in a minute that
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
said okay and the same exact thing for
 
00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
said okay and the same exact thing for
corporations

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
well the report in the house calendar
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
seemed to indicate that that bill was
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
somehow treating corporations and labor
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
unions differently even though the
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
language of both of those paragraphs was
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
identical so what i have done in this
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
version is simply took the labor union
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph and added and businesses
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
so that there's no hopefully there's no
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
confusion about
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
the fact that the same exact language is
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
applying to both labor unions and
 
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
applying to both labor unions and
businesses

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely equally
 
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.190 align:start position:0%
absolutely equally
so

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh in 1907 teddy roosevelt um in this
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of wave of anti-corruption that
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
ended up sweeping the nation in the
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
aftermath of the
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
robber baron period teddy roosevelt
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
passed into federal law a prohibition on
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
corporate donations for campaigns period
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that is federal law today there's
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
still federal law corporations cannot
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
donate period
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
in the wave of that many many states
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
including new hampshire also passed an
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
identical prohibition on corporate
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
donations to campaigns
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
so we had that language but this is
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
before things called pacs existed it was
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
just corporations can't donate
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
and so in 1999 the court struck the new
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court struck that down
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
saying it was overly broad the intent of
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
the original legislation was understood
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
to not be from general funds
 
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.110 align:start position:0%
to not be from general funds
however

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
the wording was too broad and they said
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
very explicitly
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to refer to a previous
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
a previous version of this bill
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
that i have passed out that
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
has the quote from the new hampshire
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
saying that there is of course a simple
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem the general
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
court can easily and effectively amend
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
the statute to reflect its actual
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional intent
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
which was simply to say
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
as we currently do with unions
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
that yes corporations cannot donate from
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
their general funds though if a
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
corporation or any union anyone creates
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
a segregated fund a pac
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
where the funds that come in and go out
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
are completely voluntary the funds that
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
come in are made by donations from
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
people who know this is going to a
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
political cause
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
separate from the general funds so if
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
you're a union member dues cannot be
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
used for campaign donations
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
and as the previous member mentioned if
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
you're a business even if you're a
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
business that gets taxpayer funds those
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
general funds cannot be used it has to
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
be a separate segregated fund but then
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
yes you can donate to political
 
00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:16.149 align:start position:0%
yes you can donate to political
campaigns

00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
so we have had for since 1999 when the
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
supreme court struck that law down
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
a mismatch in our labor union
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
restriction and our business restriction
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
business has no restriction even though
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
they originally had an absolute
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition that was struck down as
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
overly broad now businesses have no
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
restriction labor unions have the
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
restriction that must be from segregated
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
funds all this bill is doing
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
as it has done in the past when it's
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
passed is to say same language same
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
rules apply to both equally
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
they cannot whether labor or business
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
donate from their general funds they can
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
whether labor business donate from a
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
segregated fund that is for that purpose
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
and that's it i'm happy to take
 
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.830 align:start position:0%
and that's it i'm happy to take
questions

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative terezin
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative taking the question
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
help me i understand because i'm looking
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
at the summary of some research that was
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
done on this that
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll read it verbatim that currently
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statue prohibits political
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
contributions by partnerships labor
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
unions and individuals in excessive
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
specified amounts a previous new
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire ban on political contributions
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
made by business organizations was
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
struck down in the u.s district court
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
ruling issued 1999 and ultimately
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
removed from the law in 2011. if we were
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
to passed this wouldn't we run into the
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
same problem
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
literally no that's i i literally
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
explained this okay so
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
the and i even quoted the court just now
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
in that exact case the court said
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
the intent is good many states and the
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
federal government have a prohibition on
 
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.190 align:start position:0%
federal government have a prohibition on
corporations

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
but the intent while good the language
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
was too broad because it said it is a
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
complete ban which included segregated
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
the court said it's very easy i can
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
quote it again
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
very easy for the general court to fix
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
this by simply saying they can donate
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
through general fund for through
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
segregated funds but not general funds
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
which is what we do for labor unions
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
right now we treat businesses and labor
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
unions differently they should be
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
treated the same which is to say in
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
keeping with the original legislative
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
intent and in keeping with the supreme
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
court recommendation for what our
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
wording should be
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
to say that general funds whether
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
business or unions is prohibited
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds where those donations to
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
those funds are completely voluntary and
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
known to the people to be for political
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
purposes that is okay
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
representative if he would indulge me
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you um line seven
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
six to seven you refer to business
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
organization and your and i understand
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
your intent is to be sort of
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing by that definition
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
would that be similar perhaps you heard
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
the previous public hearing when the
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard used the term
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
business entity
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to sort of cover
 
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.829 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to sort of cover
everything

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's any i don't see the word entity
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
here no no no that we had a previous
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
the language was referred to business
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
entity and in response to does it
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
include nonprofits the response was this
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
is intended to include all businesses of
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
any kind so is business organization
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
also an attempt to include
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
all businesses of any type of structure
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
i would say not a non-profit in my
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
understanding i can go to legal experts
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
for this which you certainly probably
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
would know more than me about the legal
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
of it but i would say business
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
organization officer director executive
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
agent partner employee acting on behalf
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
of such business organs i believe that
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
that means a for-profit entity but it
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
includes corporations llcs private
 
00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.270 align:start position:0%
includes corporations llcs private
proprietorships

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
proprietorships
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's since profit or non-profit is
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
really a tax status designed to sort of
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
give other ways of fundraising the
 
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.390 align:start position:0%
give other ways of fundraising the
reality

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.069 align:start position:0%
reality
um

00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
you said you don't want it to apply to
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofits no i think it's fine to apply
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
to nonprofits because that's kind of
 
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
to nonprofits because that's kind of
already

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
in effect because of the tax status in
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
effect what nonprofits have to do
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
because nonprofits if they're a 501c3
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
they cannot uh directly electioneer and
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
they very frequently create a 501c4 arm
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
in order to do so so they're already
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then one further question the the
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
language and for committee members it's
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
on page three of the report you have um
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
they they talk about the decision talked
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
about permitting contributions from a
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
segregated account funded through
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary contributions right
 
00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.430 align:start position:0%
voluntary contributions right
so

00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
in your bill on p online 14 you talk
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
about voluntary contributions solicited
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
um i don't have a dictionary in front of
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
me and i haven't looked it up solicited
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
means that somebody is out asking for it
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
so at what point does something
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
solicited become non-voluntary
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
especially in an employment situation so
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
if your employer comes and says hey i
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
have this fund that i've established for
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
say peta and i'd like you to contribute
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
five dollars do you consider that
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
contribution of five dollars to still be
 
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.829 align:start position:0%
contribution of five dollars to still be
voluntary

00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
i mean you raise a good point but the
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
the bill still is just as strong because
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's inclusive of those solicitation
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
those kind of i guess
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
what's the word when you coercion
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
coercion type situations this would be
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
inclusive of that
 
00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
inclusive of that
so

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.030 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know why this would still be bad
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
having said that if there's better more
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
specific language that gets around these
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of legal definitions i'm happy to
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
work with anyone on this committee to to
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
make an amendment as long as this
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee is understanding and
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
supportive of the intent of the bill to
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
treat labor unions and businesses the
 
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
treat labor unions and businesses the
same

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative reed for
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware that
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
there is a very explicit definition for
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
business organization and it's 664
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
colon 216
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
that defines business organization and
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
it defines it as a for-profit
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
oh so it is for profit okay there is it
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
is explicitly defined
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
oh okay i was not aware and i said that
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't have the legal expertise to
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that but that was my suspicion and
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for for confirming my
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
suspicion but again nonprofits already
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
are under because of federal tax
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
law are already behaving like this 501
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
c3s cannot politically
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
electioneer so they have to create a
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
pack arm in order to do that
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
and many many many do
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
and representative growing gets the gold
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
star because he remembered to bring the
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
new book of elections with him which i
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
carefully took out of my bag and did not
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
put back in
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
he represents my committee member goals
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
right now representative lane
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative
 
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative
um

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i would are you aware that there
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
are many different kinds of nonprofits
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
not just 501c3s there's probably 15 or
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
16 so i
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay so when you talk about a non-profit
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
oh well maybe
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
no go ahead when you talk about a
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
non-profit are you talking about five
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
just 501 c 3s or all the other kinds as
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative lane um so no but the
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't talk to non-profits the
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
question that originally brought up the
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
question of nonprofits was does business
 
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.470 align:start position:0%
question of nonprofits was does business
organization

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
include nonprofits and we've just been
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
educated uh by representative groan that
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
in fact it does not so there's really no
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
point in bringing that up having said
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is there are many
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
different types of non-profits but when
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
they pay taxes if they are doing
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
political contributions
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
they have to pay taxes they they can't
 
00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:26.710 align:start position:0%
they have to pay taxes they they can't
be

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know a certain category of
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
non-profit and still do electioneering
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
so they end up doing this anyway
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%

committee my name is representative tony
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
lebranch and i represent the town of
 
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.750 align:start position:0%
lebranch and i represent the town of
amherst

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
amherst
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to introduce house bill
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
1394 which would tighten new hampshire's
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
camping finance laws and before i get
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that i
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
do not want to appear as wasting the
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee's time but
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
a recent news story broke about my
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
departure from the democratic party and
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
that might have derailed my plans today
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
for this hearing i had expected more
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
people to show up but i believe that new
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
story might have interfered with that
 
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
story might have interfered with that
plan

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.190 align:start position:0%
plan
so

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
i've kept my remarks very brief thank
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
you representative lebranch before you
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
continue in my apologies i meant to say
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
this before
 
01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:38.870 align:start position:0%
this before
um

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
you started committee members you do
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
have research done by christina
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh dyer dated january 17th on hb 1394.
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
so just so everybody is aware all right
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that interruption go on
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh this bill does two things uh the
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill would add an
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
additional requirement to all
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that donate within the
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to disclose where
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
their donors are from
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
and who their donors are
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is an effort to limit the influence
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
of dark money being spent in new
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire elections and then the second
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
part is a bill that i believe this
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee has seen very often
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
is to close the existing llc loophole
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
which allows for certain individuals to
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
donate above the current maximum
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
donation limits
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
that is the introduction i had planned
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
for today i had expected more people to
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
come testify behind me
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
and i will take any questions although i
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
would like to keep it brief as i have to
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
go to amherst town hall to change my
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
party affiliation thank you
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative lebranch i have a
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
question i thought you said there were
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
two parts but when i read this if you
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
could maybe just be a little clearer for
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
me i
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
read this as being
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
as you said something this committee has
 
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
as you said something this committee has
heard

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
before that
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's an allocation of the contribution
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
to members
 
01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
to members
right

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
i am pulling up the
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill at the moment
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
see this is where as an old person i get
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
to gloat and say paper is quicker
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
i mean committee members if you're
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
reading it this is looking a lot like
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
other bills we've had on this statute
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
and i think it goes to the
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the contribution and i
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
thought i heard representative lebranch
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
say two purposes
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little confused so i'm just
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
looking for clarification representative
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%

text of the bill uh it was from a

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
loophole i agreed and that is uh okay
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
what happened thank you that was my poor
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill and focus on the
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
highlight to be quite honest
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit about what
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this legislation is i
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
mean maybe you said it and i missed it
 
01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:23.829 align:start position:0%
mean maybe you said it and i missed it
but

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we have seen this bill before but
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
not everybody was on this committee the
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
last time we saw it
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
so the first section of the bill thank
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
you for the question by the way uh the
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill as i stated
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
require that all organizations within
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
that make donations in the state
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
so this can be political activity
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
organizations and out of mostly out of
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
state organizations because i know that
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
organizations within the state already
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
where their donors are coming from
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh to the second part of the bill about
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
the llc loophole uh currently uh
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are part of llc's
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
can donate on behalf of those llc's and
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
it is a technical loophole that they
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
could uh donate more than the individual
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
limit uh
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire uh i remember last
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
election i believe it was 1 000 for the
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
primary 1000 for the general if i recall
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
correctly i believe that's changed since
 
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.470 align:start position:0%
correctly i believe that's changed since
then

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
but because of this llc loophole they
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
can donate above that uh
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%

i'm here to speak in support of hb 1394
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
requiring limited liability corporations
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
to be added to the types of groups
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%

01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
i testified last year on a similar llc
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
loophole disclosure sorry llc disclosure
 
01:07:58.799 --> 01:07:59.750 align:start position:0%
loophole disclosure sorry llc disclosure
bill

01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
i outlined how i had painstakingly
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
traced the owners of llcs contributing
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
to campaigns from june to december 2019.
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
some of those llc's were businesses
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
making a small contribution but some of
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
these llc's allowed six families to make
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
more uh political contributions than the
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
individual 2019 maximum of seven
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars totaling
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
147 000 dollars in that six month period
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
the consensus of the committee however
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
was that it was too hard for the
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office the entity
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
which issues corporate and llc
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
certificates in new hampshire to enforce
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
such a disclosure
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
it's true that limited liability
 
01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:44.470 align:start position:0%
it's true that limited liability
corporations

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
perform a number of necessary business
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
their unique structure may be easily
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
abused or used in order to hide less
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
than above aboveboard activities but in
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
politics llcs are sometimes established
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
to help disguise the identity of a donor
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
or source of money spent on behalf of a
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
political candidate i might add that
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
donations or llcs involved in issue
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%

01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 2020. of that 121
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%

contributions to campaigns
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that liberal
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
leaning donors outspent conservative
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
donors using dark money by a substantial

hampshire and you would have no idea
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
you'd only have the name of the llc
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
which gave the money unless you really
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
dig in as i said it's a very painstaking
 
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.830 align:start position:0%
dig in as i said it's a very painstaking
process

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
some good news for a change
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
that would matter to this committee

noted that a revamped fec commission has
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
finally started to crack down on dark
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
money groups using llcs for violating

be the best disinfectant
 
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
be the best disinfectant
should

01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
1394's amendment uh to our current rules
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
be approved it would be a good first
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
step in accountability to shut off this
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
dark money practice in new hampshire
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
that both liberal and conservative

i have a question thank you kindly thank
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking it
 
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.350 align:start position:0%
you for taking it
um

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
i know that you're familiar with the
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill and some of the previous members
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
are familiar with the concept that we're
 
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
talking about sure but this particular
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted and i don't know that
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
you have it i mean you're focused on the
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
llc contribution and attributing it to
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
the members right i mean that's sort of
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
the sunshine that you're talking about
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we know that the past dialogue has
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
been secretary of state's office doesn't
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
keep track of member information so the
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
ability to do that requires an
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
individual such as yourself to dig
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
through the records to figure it out
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
as to that provision because this seems
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
different than those provisions relating
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
specifically to the llc my understanding
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
was that it would add
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
llcs into
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
the list of groups that were required to
 
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.350 align:start position:0%
the list of groups that were required to
report

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
what you were discussing earlier the
 
01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.830 align:start position:0%
what you were discussing earlier the
disclosing

01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
disclosing
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
um any donors within that llc
 
01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.390 align:start position:0%
um any donors within that llc
that

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
that they have to disclose the
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
percentage of
of

01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
senator lane
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
which one am i
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know we will all decide at the
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair and thank you
um

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.790 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
the secretary
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
are you aware of states where they are
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
disclosing the members when they form
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
the llc are there states
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
that do that because i know in new
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire we do not
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that that
 
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.390 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that that
we

01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't disclose llc ownership
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
the report that i gave you from issue
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
one kind of talks about the process that
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
they go through when they identify who
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
is involved usually it's tracking back
 
01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:01.830 align:start position:0%
is involved usually it's tracking back
to

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
specific addresses
 
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
specific addresses
um

01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know the the onus really here is
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we put this in place
 
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
that we put this in place
those

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh organizations are required to do it
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
it does mean that the um that the
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh oversight is very difficult
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
but we would be a whole lot better off
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
just by requiring this up front
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to trying to track it all
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
back on the on the back end after an ad
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
has been run and you know so we want
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
those we want to make it clear that you
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
need to to do this disclosure if you're
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to do political activity
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
how that gets
 
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.350 align:start position:0%
how that gets
communicated

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
communicated
 
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
communicated
um

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear on you know
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
other than putting it in the campaign
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
finance statutes
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
overseen by the secretary of state's
 
01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:56.070 align:start position:0%
overseen by the secretary of state's
office

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
but at least we would have something on
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
the books that would
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
kind of put a shot across the bow for
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
28 llcs representing those six
 
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
28 llcs representing those six
organizations

01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
um and it took me two days
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
to um get that and process that
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
information so knowing that information
 
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:22.870 align:start position:0%
information so knowing that information
um

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
up front and and
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
forcing these organizations to declare
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
this information would put us a way
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
ahead of where we are now
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
that answer i kind of gave you a
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
roundabout answer but well
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
may i follow up yeah follow up
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
so my my question was
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware of other states that do
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
this so i know what new hampshire
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
requires but are there other states
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
that do require
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
the disclosure of these llc members so
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
that it is easier in those states to be
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
more transparent i understand
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
new york is
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
an example that comes to mind i know
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the status of their
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
llc loophole bill is
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
it was 2017 2018 it was before the new
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
york assembly
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
and they have a very extensive llc
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
loophole um
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
law now whether they're whether they
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
disclose llc members
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
before political activity
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not clear about that but i
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
know that they are working very hard in
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
new york to try and get llcs to um
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
to uh disclose
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
when there is political activity
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%

01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on 1423
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
fna this is also related to campaign
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
contributions and expenditures and
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to recognize
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative marjorie porter as the
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to introduce the bill
 
01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:05.950 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is marjorie
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
porter and i represent hillsborough
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
district 1 and the good people of antrim
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
hillsborough in windsor and i'm here
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
today to introduce hb 1423
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
relative to campaign contributions and
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures and making an appropriation
 
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
expenditures and making an appropriation
therefore

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
the bill sets up a system for public
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
funding of elections in new hampshire
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
a voluntary system
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
i filed this bill at the request of a
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
constituent who is here today to testify
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of open democracy it's a
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
working on this issue and indeed this
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for years
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
faith in government and the democratic
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
system is at a low ebb
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
citizens look at the huge amount of
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
money spent on political campaigns
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
so much of it coming from special
 
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
so much of it coming from special
interests

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
interests
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
and conclude not incorrectly that the
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
political playing field is heavily
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
tilted against them
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
and when people feel powerless
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
they disengage and democracy loses its
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
driving force
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
the problem is especially acute at the
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
federal level but new hampshire is not
 
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
federal level but new hampshire is not
immune

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
immune
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
according to recent polls the citizens
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire are increasingly
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
concerned with the influence of big
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
money and out-of-state interests are
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
having on elections in our state
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
indeed the poll referenced in the bill
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
showed 80 percent of those questions
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
republicans democrats and undeclared
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
believe special interests have more
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
influence than they the voters do
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
they want things to change
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
polls also show
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
wide support for a system of public
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
funding for elections as a means of
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
bringing about this change
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
for almost two decades now there have
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
been public funding bills study
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
committees a bipartisan commission and a
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
blue ribbon task force
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
all seeking a way to make this happen in
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
the granite state despite these efforts
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
no statewide system of public funding
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
is in existence
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
knowing that lasting success requires
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan buy-in in july of 2018 a
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
public financing working group was
 
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
public financing working group was
convened

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
convened
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
six legislators two senators and four
 
01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.310 align:start position:0%
six legislators two senators and four
representatives

01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
half democrats and half republicans
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair i believe that you were a
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
member of this working group
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
their charge was to craft a public
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
financing bill that would have broad
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
appeal among members of both parties
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
hb 1423 is the result
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is lengthy and detailed
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
and sets up a well thought out process
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
for making sure there is fairness
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
but the basics are these
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
participation in the public funding
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
system is entirely voluntary and it does
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
not replace what we have
 
01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.350 align:start position:0%
not replace what we have
now

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
qualifying candidates for governor and
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
executive council are eligible to
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
receive voter dollars and if they win
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
their primary contest additional grants
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
in election years register voters
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
registered voters receive four
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
certificates worth 25 voter dollars each
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they may contribute to
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
participating candidates of their choice
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
the voter dollar approach is truly
 
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.430 align:start position:0%
the voter dollar approach is truly
transformational

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
transformational
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
incentivizing candidates to seek
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
contributions from a broad swath of the
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
electorate and incentivizing everyday
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
citizens to identify candidates who
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
deserve their support
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
and for me this is one of the most
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
compelling reasons to move this bill
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
forward places that are using a similar
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
system are finding increased engagement
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
of citizens in their processes and
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's very late primary makes
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
it difficult for candidates to raise
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
enough money for the general election
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
from small donations alone
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
grants for primary winners solve that
 
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:43.910 align:start position:0%
grants for primary winners solve that
problem

01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
to become qualified eligible for voter
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
dollars candidates need to first show
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
that they can generate enough public
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
support to mount a viable campaign and
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
they do this
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
by collecting small contributions from a
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh executive council candidates must
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
collect at least 500 private
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
contributions of five dollars to up to
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
125 dollars
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
a gubernatorial candidate must collect
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
hundred contributions of five dollars to
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
up to two hundred fifty dollars
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
qualifying quant con
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
qualifying contributions much must come
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
from registered voters residing within a
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
candidate's district this would apply to
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
the executive council
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
in addition the candidate must publicly
 
01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.430 align:start position:0%
in addition the candidate must publicly
disavow

01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
disavow
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures funds spent by
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
outside groups or individuals on the
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
candidate's behalf
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
participating candidates must agree not
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
to accept aggregate private
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
contributions from any one donor for
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
greater than 125 dollars for the council
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
and 250 dollars for the governor for the
 
01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
and 250 dollars for the governor for the
primary

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
and similar amounts for the general
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
no more than 10 percent of private
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
contribution totals may come from
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
out-of-state sources
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
and candidates may not accept
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
contributions from businesses unions and
 
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
contributions from businesses unions and
lobbyists

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyists
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are also strict limits on the use
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
of personal funds and funds carried over
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
from previous campaigns
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriation we are asking for is
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
one dollar to set up the fund now
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
the bill details sources for additional
 
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
the bill details sources for additional
funding

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that passing hb 14 23 will
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
give granite staters a stronger voice in

amount of time candidates spend talking
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
to constituents and learning about
 
01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:13.590 align:start position:0%
to constituents and learning about
issues

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
it increases the quality and in equal
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity in our political system
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
it also encourages more competition
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
it reduces the influence of special
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
interests and out-of-state special
 
01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.149 align:start position:0%
interests and out-of-state special
interests

01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
interests
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes that quality legislators
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill does is
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
it complies with all federal and
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements and upholds
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court challenges
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
to these systems
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
the main public financing system allows
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
by the public and reduces
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
industry's objections that's a quote
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
from maine house speaker
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
hannah pingree
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
also i have a quote from janet nepali
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
former governor of arizona
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
which i won't read in full it's in my
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony but it basically to
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
summarize means that you can vote your
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
conscience and you don't have to vote
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
what industry wants you to
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill has been introduced before
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
was first introduced in 2000
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.870 align:start position:0%
and and
narrowly

narrowly
 
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.990 align:start position:0%
narrowly

passed
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
it has been studied two times with a
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
formal commission or task force
 
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.590 align:start position:0%
formal commission or task force

informally
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i in my testimony list a lot of the
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
other pieces of legislation you have
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions or
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent representative
 
01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.870 align:start position:0%
questions represent representative
growing

01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
miss zinc for taking my question
 
01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.189 align:start position:0%
miss zinc for taking my question
does

01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill do anything to prevent
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
candidates from continuing to fund their
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
campaigns under traditional
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
methods taking
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
money as you know from from donors as as
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
we currently do no
 
01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:26.149 align:start position:0%
we currently do no
so

01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
how how then
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow-up uh how
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
then will this
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the impact of
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
of you know what would be termed dark
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
money or or private funding of elections
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question and so
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
just just to understand these systems
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
are 100 voluntary it basically puts a
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
parallel system
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
in place so you can either choose the
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
old method of
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
of raising private contributions
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
unlimited or you know with who from
 
01:35:00.239 --> 01:35:01.109 align:start position:0%
unlimited or you know with who from
whatever

01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
across the country and other states
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
that have you have these systems maine
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
for example has a 65
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
of candidates opt-in to this connecticut
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
has seen 74 percent of candidates opt in
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
as these systems are in place more
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
candidates are opting for this system
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
of both parties and both parties when
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
they opt into this system have won
 
01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
they opt into this system have won
elections

01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
using um these types of system systems
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
in other states but if you want to use
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
the current system you can you perf
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's your choice as a candidate
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
follow up madame follow up
 
01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
follow up madame follow up
uh

01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
in a in a race such as the governor's
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
race that is it's a statewide race
 
01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.430 align:start position:0%
race that is it's a statewide race
obviously

01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard for a governor
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
candidate to do enough door knocking to
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
contact the citizens even within a small
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
state like new hampshire so it becomes
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
very very much a
 
01:36:06.239 --> 01:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
very very much a
political

01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
organization i mean the organization the
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
candidates um
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
you know organization to to advanced
 
01:36:15.119 --> 01:36:16.310 align:start position:0%
you know organization to to advanced
candidate

01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh and a media campaign which takes a
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
any uh record from the states that use
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
it for example maine
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the success
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the candidates that are using this
 
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.030 align:start position:0%
of the candidates that are using this
are

01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
are
do

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of those that use it when
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
their elections do 10 percent win their
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
elections how how effective is it in
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
those candidates succeeding in winning
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
the race
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i would refer you to anna's testimony
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
from the main
 
01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.350 align:start position:0%
from the main
citizen

01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
for clean elections testimony she does
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
reference the success rates in maine and
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
there are reports on on those success
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
rates i do want to just
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
say that i believe
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
deeply that this bill gives candidates
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
enough money to compete in 2020 governor
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
sununu raised 1.4 million dollars for
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
his race and spent that much money in
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
the election
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would give gubernatorial
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
candidates 1.4 million dollars to run a
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
competitive race so i believe deeply so
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
a cap of 420 000 dollars that that a
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
candidate can use on the citizen
 
01:37:29.679 --> 01:37:31.109 align:start position:0%
candidate can use on the citizen
certificates

01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
collecting those from citizens and then
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
the grant is a million dollars so this
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
is very competitive and is enough money
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
it might not be the most i mean we have
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
seen elections i think governor benson
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
spent 12 million dollars on his
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
elections doesn't give you the most
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
money but it is competitive and enough
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
money to run
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and when you refer to the
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that's the writ in the written
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
package that we received
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
members

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um thank you
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
question um mike
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
my question is um sixty thousand dollars
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a contested
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
general election race um for executive
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
council i mean just by looking at cash
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
on hand of our current counselors like
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
that seems like a little low to run a
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
competitive race like do you feel that
 
01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.750 align:start position:0%
competitive race like do you feel that
this

01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
becomes almost like an incumbent
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
protection plan by you know restricting
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of money
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
that you know challengers could raise i
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
know it's voluntary but i guess that's
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
my question is does it become where the
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
incumbent's protected because the
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
challenger has to overcome name id and
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
other factors before incumbent
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
protection it actually empowers more
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
candidates to run for office and the cap
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
on the executive council race in this
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is actually a
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty four thousand dollars
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
so the sixty thousand is the grant but
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
they cannot they can raise up to
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
eighty four thousand dollars in the
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
certificate part of the bill so you have
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
to add both of those numbers for the 144
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
000 and i do think 144 thousand dollars
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
is enough to be competitive again not
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
the most an executive council candidate
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
has raised but enough
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
for you to reach out to a fifth of the
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
state in those races
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to share the data and
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
analysis that we had done on previous
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
executive council races especially to
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
get to that 500 number which is the
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
number of individual contributions and
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
prior executive council candidates have
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
gotten to 500 new hampshire voters to
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
give them contributions so that's again
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
how we sort of designed that
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
but it also
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that just anyone can
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
qualify you have to reach out and have
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
at least 500
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
people in your district give you
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
at least five dollars
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative terezian thank
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking the
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
question missing
 
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
question missing
um

01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
when you reference the governor's race
 
01:40:01.199 --> 01:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
when you reference the governor's race
um

01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
if this were to become law wouldn't that
 
01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
if this were to become law wouldn't that
just

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
create a situation where he would spend
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
more money
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and potentially people would come back
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer and want to raise more
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
money in other words i could see the
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
spiraling the amount of money spent in
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
campaigns even
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
higher you know was it was reported
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
prior to the governor getting into the
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
race for a senate that they people were
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
talking about that being a hundred
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar race so it seems like
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
this has the potential of of making that
 
01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.189 align:start position:0%
this has the potential of of making that
um

01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
number get even higher on these races
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a possibility
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and and i
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
am outraged by how the cost of campaigns
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
have been escalating over the last 20
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
years especially you referenced a
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
federal race um this only deals with
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
state races but i think if you look at
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
the data from maine and arizona and
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
other states that have these systems the
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
costs have been more stable
 
01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
costs have been more stable
actually

01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
maine has had their program since 1996
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
and they have voted once to increase the
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
thresholds of the grants to increase
 
01:41:09.119 --> 01:41:09.990 align:start position:0%
thresholds of the grants to increase
that

01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is a slight part of the main bill
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
that increases for inflation a little
 
01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.270 align:start position:0%
that increases for inflation a little
bit

01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
but state rep races in maine get five
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and they did that in
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
1996 and has stayed stable in that way
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
so i think if you actually look at some
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the how the track record of how these
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
systems have worked in other states um
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
it does actually keeping kind of
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
campaign spending
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.430 align:start position:0%
campaign spending
um

01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
with that enough threshold and not
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you ms zinke
 
01:41:46.719 --> 01:41:47.830 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you ms zinke
um

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry i haven't had a chance to
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
read this but
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
what about in-kind contributions is
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
there a restriction on that and is that
 
01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
there a restriction on that and is that
covered

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes so in-kind contributions are covered
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the threshold
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
i believe it's for governor two hundred
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollars of in kind and for
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
executive councils 125 dollars of in
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
kind so if somebody wants to give you
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
250 dollars worth of pizza you can
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
accept that but if they want to give you
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
300 worth of pizza
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
you that threshold is the same cap
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
as a cash contribution
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
may have a follow-up further question um
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
what about the organizations that have
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
been mentioned today who come in and
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps are not connected to the
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
campaign but
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
will run
 
01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.189 align:start position:0%
will run
separate

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
ads or flyers
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
is that covered in this or is that
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
something else that we need to regulate
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
so independent expenditures and
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
electioneering communication is outside
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill although this
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill does say if you qualify to run
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
under the public financing system you
 
01:42:50.719 --> 01:42:51.990 align:start position:0%
under the public financing system you
disavow

01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
disavow
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
that spending for your candidate it
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit
 
01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit
candidate

01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures for running for
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
office but i think if you saw in other
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
states where there's been public
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
disavows of election year
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures or pac money
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
most of the pacs do respect the
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
candidates wishes if they say please do
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
not spend money on my pack
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
but there's not a formal
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that stops that other
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
than the candidate publicly saying i
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to have money
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
spent in an independent expenditure way
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um thank you
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair you just spurred a question
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm thinking like
 
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.109 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm thinking like
um

01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know in a primary and you have
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
independent groups that
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
you don't want them to spend money on
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
your behalf but maybe a candidate would
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
host a press conference and be like if
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
you were gonna spend money
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
you would spend it here and in this
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
place and like technically there's a
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
loophole there about like yeah they can
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
publicly disavow it and say please don't
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
spend money but it still happens anyways
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
so how does this prevent that from
 
01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
so how does this prevent that from
happening

01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for that question and
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
i do want to
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
sort of think about how these systems
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is a four twenty five dollar
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
certificate program
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the city of seattle and in the last
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
municipal election
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
there amazon spent over a million
 
01:44:13.119 --> 01:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
there amazon spent over a million
dollars

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get candidates elected
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
that supported amazon's values it didn't
 
01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
that supported amazon's values it didn't
work

01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
this system held up to to a gross
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
independent expenditure so i think when
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
you look at those cases of how this has
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
worked in other states you have seen
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
that these systems hold up to that kind
 
01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
that these systems hold up to that kind
of

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's not that amazon could have
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
spent more money in that case there was
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
just nothing left to buy
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
they bought all the tv ads they bought
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
all the radio ads they bought all the
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
television ads um and there's just
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
nothing left to buy one political expert
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
said in in one of the news reporters so
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think when you look at the case
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
studies of how this works in other
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
states it actually really holds up to
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
really big independent expenditure
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
fights and maine has independent
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures that's part of maine's
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
culture and and it happens with um but i
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
think in maine voters say i want to be i
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
want to vote for a candidate that does
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
not want to take this out of this money
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that there is a kind of
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
incentive to say i want to run clean in
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
maine which is why they call their
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
system clean elections
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
and voters really do respect that kind
 
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.950 align:start position:0%
and voters really do respect that kind
of

01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
declaration that the candidates say that
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
they want to be accountable and one of
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
the things we call the system a voter
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
owned system so voters are owning the
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
system and it's not being funded by
 
01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.669 align:start position:0%
system and it's not being funded by
out-of-state

01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
interests and i think that that's really
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
important that citizens feel that there
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
there's faith in the process
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%

citizens united versus fec
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
wealthy donors and corporations have
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
exerted undue influence in elections at
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
all levels from the local through the
 
01:46:36.159 --> 01:46:37.750 align:start position:0%
all levels from the local through the

national
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
large amounts of money are contributed
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
to campaigns which often rely on
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
misleading attack ads
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
rather than participation in relevant
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
political conversations about issues
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
politicians in new hampshire have
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
received large donations from hospitals
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
insurance groups pharmaceutical
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
corporations the energy industry and
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
communications companies
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
these corporations do not have to
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
publicly disclose their identities so
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
that citizens do not know who is
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
supporting and influencing candidates
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
such a system directly affects who runs
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
for office and which pieces of
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislation are put into law
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
so candidates of moderate means cannot
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
compete against those funded by deep
 
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.950 align:start position:0%
compete against those funded by deep
pockets

01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
pockets
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the opinions and issues of the wealthy
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
drive the political agenda
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
everyday voters hold less weight with
 
01:47:36.719 --> 01:47:38.149 align:start position:0%
everyday voters hold less weight with
candidates

01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
the solution for this situation is to
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
reform the funding of campaigns so that
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
candidates and elected officials are
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
motivated to serve citizens of new
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire rather than big businesses
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
if enacted
 
01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:53.709 align:start position:0%
if enacted
h.b

01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
h.b
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
1423 would be a first step in such
 
01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:58.310 align:start position:0%
1423 would be a first step in such
reform

01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
reform
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
candidates have to meet certain criteria
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for voter dollars and
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
registered voters receive four 25 dollar
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
certificates that they may assign to the
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
candidates of their choice
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
participation by candidates and voters
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
is voluntary
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
as a result of this reform engagement
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
between candidates and voters would
 
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
between candidates and voters would
increase

01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
the number of financially viable
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
candidates would grow
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
and they would have to work to make
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
voters believe they are the best choice
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
to receive voter dollars
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
candidates focus would turn toward their
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
local constituents instead of toward
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
corporate donors
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
of course funding of this system is an
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
important consideration
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
the report of the bipartisan 2008
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
commission to study the feasibility of
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
public funding of state election
 
01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.709 align:start position:0%

has a two-page list of 64 ideas for

sources for public funding
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
our fellow new england states of maine
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
and connecticut have well established
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
public funding systems for state
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
elections that have been in place for
 
01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.109 align:start position:0%
elections that have been in place for
years

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the interest of decreasing the
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
influence of big money and increasing
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
grassroots participation by candidates
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
and voters in our elections

like that if it was read they were safe
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
but no and this can
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%

01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
first of all i want to thank all of you
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
as representatives um as a voter in new
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire the amount of time and effort
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
as i
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
get a little more involved feeling the
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
need to get involved as you see more and
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
more what's going on i really appreciate
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
what you guys all of you have done um in
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
being participants in this process
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
i want to register support for 1423 not
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
because i think it's the ideal solution
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not for
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic solutions and big processes
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
to solve problems that you would hope
 
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:48.810 align:start position:0%
didn't come up
 
01:50:48.810 --> 01:50:49.990 align:start position:0%
didn't come up
[Music]

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
with something like financing campaigns
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't have also thought that
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
a-rod would make 250 million dollars to
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
play baseball and i think at some point
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
as a voter and a citizen
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
you have to say enough is enough and
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
move something against it obviously i
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
think citizens united was an important
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
ruling by the supreme court and affected
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
but i also recognize as a reality
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
important and how you find
 
01:51:20.719 --> 01:51:22.550 align:start position:0%
important and how you find
can't

01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
see candidates but i think there has to
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
be some pushback on how far this has
 
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.070 align:start position:0%
be some pushback on how far this has
come

01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
and whether this bill is
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh tight i think it's goals of more
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
fairness more transparency
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
is important i think the fact that it is
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary i think that was a great
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
question by the rep to my left about um
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know what how will this potentially
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
affected if it is voluntary will it work
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know but hopefully it will be
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
some pushback and there's some evidence
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
that it's worked in other states and in
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
other cities
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
i particularly think
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
engagement of citizens is important and
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
part of the reason it's being lost is
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
this thought that big money and other
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
interests are running the show and
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's so little i can do
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
i think everyone in this room is a
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
testament that you can do something and
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
i hopefully that will do it i mean i
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
guess i'm struck by the
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
person on channel nine that was a rep
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
from nashua who said that no one showed
 
01:52:21.199 --> 01:52:22.070 align:start position:0%
from nashua who said that no one showed
up

01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
about the redistricting maps for that
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
big area
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
that shocked me
 
01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.229 align:start position:0%
that shocked me
and

01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
this i think would start to build more
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
citizen engagement i don't have the
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
source for this but from open democracy
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think that was told that
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
66 of independents 59 of republicans and
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
71 percent of democrats when polled
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
would be more likely to vote for a
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
candidate who participated
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
in a public funded program similar to
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
this and again i don't know the details
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
of that and i'm not sure if that's in
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
olivia's report but i think that's
 
01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:01.350 align:start position:0%
olivia's report but i think that's
significant

01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
finally there was a thing that i also
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
saw where there were two-thirds of new
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters support of public
 
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters support of public
campaigns

01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:09.910 align:start position:0%
campaigns
again

01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
i understand reticence about enacting a
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
program the initial budget ask of one
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
dollar just to
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
get it going i think is quite reasonable
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
and like others i would be willing to
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
give that one dollar if that's what it
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:22.470 align:start position:0%
give that one dollar if that's what it
takes

01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
takes
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
what i really would love to see is
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
campaigns be brought back to the
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
citizens and having their involvement i
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
think this is one step that might work
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
if it didn't then let's revise it and
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
make it work better but as it goes right
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
now i'm not willing to throw up my arms
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
and just say this is how it goes and
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's why i decided to come down here
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
to just express my opinion and thanks
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
for your time and i'll take any
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you mr mclaughlin any
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative murhead
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%

01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
seat oh okay
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you to my colleagues on the
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
election law committee for um
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap your minds around this
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and this idea i think it's
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
really cool i'd want to describe it
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
super briefly and how it would operate
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
there are basically three steps to the
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
bill and operation the first one would
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
be that candidates would try to qualify
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
by collecting lots of small donations
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
they have to collect a whole lot of
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
small donations
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
almost five dollars
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
and once
 
01:54:53.599 --> 01:55:00.629 align:start position:0%
and once
they

01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.639 --> 01:55:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
qualify

01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
then they're able to ask citizens for
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
the 25 certificates four of which are
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
given to every voter in the state
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
and they're eligible to receive those
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
certificates up to a certain limit
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
and in the third step of its operation
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
the winners of primaries would receive
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
um a tranche of money immediately from
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
the public financing fund
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
so candidates for the gubernatorial
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
election would receive a million dollars
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
as soon as they won the primary because
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
the turnaround from the primary to the
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
general election is so short in our
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
current calendar
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
so those are the three steps
 
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.990 align:start position:0%
so those are the three steps
qualify

01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then you have to really work hard to
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
qualify a lot of candidates who want to
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
be governor a lot of people want to be
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
executive counselors would never qualify
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
you got to get a lot of small donations
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
to qualify
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
then once you qualify you can ask people
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
for those certificates and the third
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
thing if you win the primary you get an
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
extra bunch of money that you that
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
allows you to immediately run
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
um a viable campaign of course as all of
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
the the nature of of of money in in
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
elections is such that every extra
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
dollar is is extra valuable up to a
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
certain point and then the utility of
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
each dollar kind of peaks
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
it flattens out it diminishes
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
at a certain point if you spend 100
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars on a senate campaign it
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
approaches zero it probably goes
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
negative every extra dollar of
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure is probably harming your
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
campaign after a while
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
so this is enough money to get people to
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
the point where they can run viable
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
campaigns one point i think is worth
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
knowing is that candidates can collect
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
private donations throughout the entire
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
campaign season there is no limit to
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
that ex to the number of donations
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
there's just a limit to the amount they
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
can't collect more than 250 check from
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
any one individual if you're running for
 
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:50.310 align:start position:0%
any one individual if you're running for
governor

01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
but you can do it while you're
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
collecting certificates in the general
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
election you can keep campaign here's
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
the key 90 of the donations have to come
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
from in-state donors
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that i think is the great thing
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
about this bill yesterday somebody
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
called me while i was working somebody
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
running for governor in another state of
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
course you know they want my money i say
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
you call the wrong guy i don't have any
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
money and why are you talking to me i'm
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
not in your state you know you shouldn't
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
be responsive to me i'm not your
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
constituent i'll never be your
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
constituent this is what's wrong with
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
our system that you're calling people
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
all over the country begging for money
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
and it's not tuning you in to the to the
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
voters whom you will represent
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'd love to have
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know a political system where a
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
certain kind of great citizen could
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
realistically aspire to be the governor
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the state where you know plow driver
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
who's a volunteer firefighter who served
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the select board who's a coach who
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
knows their town
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
and who volunteers for everything and
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
has done so for years and years assault
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the earth who knows their region who
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
knows this state can realistically
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
aspire to be the governor of the state
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'd love to see something like that be
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
our governor even though they're not
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
connected to networks of rich lawyers
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
who give
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know accustomed to writing checks to
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
candidates and they're not a cousin they
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
haven't made promises to unions and they
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
just aren't part of the power elite
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that this that this
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill would actually make that possible
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
with olivia zinc i've worked through the
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
potential cost of this bill if it were
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
in full operation
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to talk about that
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
i can just
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
briefly point to this that if there were
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
contested if lots of people ran the
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
primaries and lots of people qualified
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
again not easy to qualify because you
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
need so many small donations from
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
in-state donors to do that but if lots
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
of people did it and if every election
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
every executive council district and the
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
governors were contested
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
and three people were running for
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
governor that kind of thing we we see
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
we've gone line by line by line three to
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
six million dollars per campaign season
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of money but that's all the money
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
it takes for voters to own elections and
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
and that's now this appropriation this
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill just donates one dollar the idea
 
01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
bill just donates one dollar the idea
being

01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
the this i this idea i think to work has
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
to come from both parties it has to be
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
initiated in a in a broad bipartisan way
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
people have to understand that people
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
have to like the idea
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then the taxpayers will be
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i think their representatives will
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
be okay with funding it so this bill is
 
01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
be okay with funding it so this bill is
about

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
is about transmitting the idea and about
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
about arguing for the underlying concept
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative mirad for taking my
 
01:59:29.599 --> 01:59:30.470 align:start position:0%
representative mirad for taking my
question

01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
so you you went through three steps and
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
i i have
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
getting a better understanding of step
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
one and two of of how they
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know that collect a bunch of small
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
donations and then the qualified
 
01:59:43.599 --> 01:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
donations and then the qualified
candidate

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
received some the certificates during
 
01:59:46.639 --> 01:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
received some the certificates during
the

01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
campaign the primary campaign but at
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
after the candidate wins the primary you
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
said they get a large sum of money a
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
large lump of money
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
where does that large lump of money come
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
from how is that raised it comes from
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
exactly the same fund that finances the
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
25 certificates so there's a voter
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
elections fund
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's created
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
this bill only contributes one dollar to
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
that fund which is not certain not not
 
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
that fund which is not certain not not
sufficient

02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:27.910 align:start position:0%
the bill
and

02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
right now that fund would be funded
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
through fines on people who violate
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
election laws and so forth donations and
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
to the one dollar but ultimately you
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
you follow up madam chair follow up so
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
so the
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
is not coming from donations from
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
individuals but ultimately it will come
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
from the state that's correct and those
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
fo what every voter in the state gets
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
are four twenty five dollar certificates
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have to come up with a
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars themselves most voters
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a hundred dollars they could
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
give to candidates so they're getting a
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
certificate that's financed from the
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
voter election fund
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
i.e the state yes
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
alexander um thank you madam chair
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative has there
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
been any thought of making this a
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment um and i guess
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
my question is if this is so popular and
 
02:01:21.679 --> 02:01:22.790 align:start position:0%
my question is if this is so popular and
widely

02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
widely
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know wanted by you know all
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
parties based on what we just heard has
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
there been any thought of just turning
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
this into a cacr instead
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
so i actually what i just said and this
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
is my opinion is that in order to as i
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
foresee it to for something
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
elicit that kind of broad and deep
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
support um from from the whole
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
population there's a further question i
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
haven't done the work to i think we're
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
trying to convince people of the idea
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
right now and bring that to push i
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually don't agree with vi with with
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
amending the constitution every time you
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
have a good idea so i think i'd be very
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
reluctant to go down that route
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
further questions representative hayward
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question um i'd like to go
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
assessment about how this would improve
 
02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.350 align:start position:0%
assessment about how this would improve
the

02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
the transparency
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
and in full disclosure i
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i i work in the state of maine so
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
with a law
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
similar has already been described i
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
would look
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
not at
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
how well that law worked i would look at
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
various out-of-state monies spent
 
02:02:45.119 --> 02:02:45.990 align:start position:0%
various out-of-state monies spent
uh

02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
i mean the senatorial election
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
last last time around was now you're
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
aspect i'm
 
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.589 align:start position:0%
aspect i'm
interested

02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
interested
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:11.350 align:start position:0%
in that
thing

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you we i mean the idea um
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
and again i think it's it's in fact
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
illegal to to to say that independent
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures can't be made so this bill
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
can't say that although i think the
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
disavowal function
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
apparently is quite effective
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
this bill aims to give candidates for
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
the executive council and for the
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
governor a sufficient amount of money to
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
run a viable campaign
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
if they can show
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
that they have real support
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
from voters of new hampshire who in the
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
initial stage are willing to write them
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
a five dollar check in large numbers
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
and and so it's it's not as i said meant
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
to to give every candidate the maximum
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
amount that that they might conceivably
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
spend or wish to have just enough to
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
viable campaign
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for when you proceeded to make
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
meant that at a certain point a
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
contribution to a candidate has a
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
all right um and then signed up to speak
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%

all the previous um
 
02:04:59.199 --> 02:05:00.069 align:start position:0%

uh
 
02:05:00.079 --> 02:05:02.069 align:start position:0%
uh
testimonies

02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
testimonies
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
the idea of level the playing field for
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
all the candidates sounds wonderful
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i see a lot of candidates good
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
candidates out there working hard just
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
to like fundraising
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
to do good for the public and i
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
understand about the gap
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
and this level of playing field also
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
reminded me of the communist system of
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
everybody had to be the same
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
now it's not based on performance it's
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
how we feel that people
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
should be on the equal level it doesn't
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
matter your level of performance but it
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
makes me feel good that you're on the
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
same level of playing field and it's all
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
about the money
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
and as of right now this is about
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
the uh establish a voter owned
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
election commission to admit administer
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
i don't even owe my vote right now that
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
is what i feel like and see for myself
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
after november 3rd election 2020 i don't
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
even owe my vote
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
because there's no way
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
the whole state of new hampshire
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%

voter's eligibility to vote now if you
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
look at the analysis part it's not
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
exactly correct because
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%

the oath of office a little over a week
ago

02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
seems like a month
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
um but things are going smoothly and and
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%

involving

02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
involving
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%

doing recounts
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%

in that area
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%

was in the house and has a background in
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%

02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%

come over and see me or call me anytime
 
02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:53.270 align:start position:0%
come over and see me or call me anytime
um

02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1542
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
we opposed the bill as written
 
02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.390 align:start position:0%
we opposed the bill as written
um

02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
the constitution our state constitution
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
is clear that ballots have to be counted
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
that are cast have to be counted on the
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
day of the election
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we also have an exemption
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
from the national voter registration act
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
same-day voter registration that
 
02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
same-day voter registration that
exemption

02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
allows us
 
02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
currently not to have to engage with in
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
which other states that
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh they're subject to the national voter
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
registration act have to have
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
the general tenor of the bill trying to
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
create checks and balances in the
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that voters are
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
adequately qualified is certainly a fair
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
discussion to have
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
however this particular bill has some
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
pretty significant problems
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
that i think would land us in court very
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and i think it would be very
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to defend
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions that are in here
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
and just to give you some examples
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
um in section three of the bill i'm
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
sorry section two of the bill
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a provision and the statute
 
02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.149 align:start position:0%
um there's a provision and the statute
currently

02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that allows
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
for a voter to be recognized
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
by firsthand knowledge
 
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
by firsthand knowledge
by

02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
an election official in the polling
 
02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
an election official in the polling
place

02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
as to their identity
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
that recognition
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
is the same as the person having
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
a valid form of id to accept the ballot
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill would allow
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
and there is there is currently a
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute that allows any
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
other voter in the polling place
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
to challenge a voter who's recognized by
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
an election official
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
and that voter can proceed to vote if
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
they fill out a challenged voter
 
02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.950 align:start position:0%
they fill out a challenged voter
affidavit

02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
this provision would require that a
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
voter who is challenged by being
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
recognized by an election official would
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
automatically then have to fill out
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
that would that could create a situation
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
where a voter could simply hang on the
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
polling place and wait for voters
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining their ballot being recognized
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
to simply challenge them
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
and forcing a provisional ballot on that
 
02:14:19.679 --> 02:14:20.950 align:start position:0%
and forcing a provisional ballot on that
person

02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
the person would then have to go home
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
and get their credentials and then come
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
back to the polling place
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill actually deals
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
with a provision
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
that allows a voter to go into the town
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
clerk's office prior to the day of the
 
02:14:50.079 --> 02:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
clerk's office prior to the day of the
election

02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
to request an absentee ballot and in the
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
process of requesting the absentee
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
ballot uh
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
they can either prevent that they can
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
either present
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh their qualifications either driver's
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
license or whatever
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
to prove their identity
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
or sign a
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
challenged voter affidavit
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
verified on the day of the election
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's a process
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
the absentee voting process is generally
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
different than voting by official ballot
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
on the day of the election
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
the qualifications are different you
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
know a voter who's on the checklist
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
can make application to the clerk and
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
receive their absentee ballot
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh and vote on it it can be challenged
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
on the day of the election when the
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
ballots are being processed
 
02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:46.069 align:start position:0%
ballots are being processed
um

02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
but this would require
 
02:15:48.079 --> 02:15:48.790 align:start position:0%
but this would require
uh

02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
it would it would offer as an
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
alternative a voter to cast a
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot prior to the election
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh when they're doing that in the
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
clerk's office
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate for a provisional
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
ballot to be offered to a voter prior to
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
election day
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
and my sense is that provisional ballots
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
are something that should be offered on
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
the day of the election
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
if a voter cannot there's unable to fill
 
02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
out a just a regular official ballot
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then there are provisions further
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
down in section
 
02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:31.350 align:start position:0%
down in section
six

02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
roman numeral ii would a plow would have
 
02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:35.669 align:start position:0%
roman numeral ii would a plow would have
would

02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
require that a unique identifier be
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
placed on a
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
that could be problematic in how it's
 
02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:44.950 align:start position:0%
that could be problematic in how it's
done

02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then roman numeral six
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
is a requirement that
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
anyone any voter who votes by a
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot would be required to
 
02:16:58.230 --> 02:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
come back before the polls close
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
with their identification
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to have their vote
 
02:17:02.559 --> 02:17:03.589 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to have their vote
counted

02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
counted
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that may not be enough time and i
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
suspect that the courts would have a
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
real problem with that
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
currently those states that engage in
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots issue them on the
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
day of the election
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the voter has a period of time after
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
show their qualifications or be verified
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
by election officials to have their vote
 
02:17:26.319 --> 02:17:28.549 align:start position:0%
by election officials to have their vote
count

02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
count
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there madam chair and i'd be
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
thank you secretary scanlon it does make
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
it a little more problematic when the
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor's not here so we don't have the
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
entire intent
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
for secretary scanlan on
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:15.910 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm speaking to support bill 1542
 
02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:20.309 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm speaking to support bill 1542
fn

02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
fn
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
um i've been to a lot i've been to a lot
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
of elections
 
02:18:24.479 --> 02:18:25.349 align:start position:0%
of elections
and

02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:25.359 --> 02:18:26.629 align:start position:0%
and
recounts

02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
and i see that many recounts they have a
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
very small margin
 
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
between the winner
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the loser
 
02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:40.230 align:start position:0%
and the loser
so

02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
this bills is important
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
to determine if those votes that casted
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
that day was real or not
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
because from my understanding is that
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
the follow-up to make sure that those
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh paperwork affidavit people sign that
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
they could go to jail if they lie in all
 
02:18:59.200 --> 02:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
they could go to jail if they lie in all
that

02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
and not being enforced
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
so and the election officials
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
are not allowed to do anything about
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
that so people can just showed up
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
without paperwork and just promise
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
something inside and no one follow up on
 
02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:16.389 align:start position:0%
something inside and no one follow up on
it

02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
just like you buy with no teeth
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and those margins
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
of the winning and the losing is very
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
critical to the voice of freedom
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
and rice and so many constitutional
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
rights of the whole state of new
 
02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:32.830 align:start position:0%
rights of the whole state of new
hampshire

02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
so um i hear that um
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
mr skilling was saying earlier about
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's conflicting with that one-day
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
same-day registration
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
and from what i hear on the ground a lot
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
is that we should get rid of that same
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
day registration
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
that is a big problem in our state
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
the college students from all over the
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
places they just sign in
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
and vote thank you i understand that but
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
if you could stick to 1542 that would be
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
great yes so please support this bill
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
and um you know so we need to check and
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
that people are qualified
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
you go to the bank and you want to take
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
out your money you have to show your id
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
you go to vote you want to take away my
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
freedom you need to show id too
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
with your vote not with just a promise
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%

sure you folks have heard
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
plenty about how many people in the

state of new hampshire
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%

i'm going to speak a little more
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
personally today with regards to what i

saw occurring in my hometown what i saw
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
occurring in my hometown is that the
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
same day registration
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
um was
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
a line i
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
took 18 different people i volunteered
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
to pick up people and take them in to
 
02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
to pick up people and take them in to
vote

02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
during those 18 well i had 19 trips
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
because i voted by myself before that so
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%

02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
same-day registration and for for um
 
02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
same-day registration and for for um
for

02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
not having appropriate voter id
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
was longer than any of the lines to just
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
get your ballot to vote that's a problem
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
we have one voting
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
place where in my town um i saw more
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
than 25 percent
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
on in every occasion i went around that
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
parking lot and i took us i took a a a
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
count on how many out of state cars that
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
i saw at my polling page place and at no
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
point was it lower than 25 percent
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
the last issue was i saw on more than
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
one of my 19 trips
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
black sprinter vans with multiple people
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
getting out of them going into my
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
polling place and signing up for same
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
day register voter registration
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
our laws our voting laws are so
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey is a shambles um
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
this will provide to tighten it up a
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more it's it may not be
 
02:22:51.439 --> 02:22:52.710 align:start position:0%
little bit more it's it may not be
as

02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
as tight as it should be but the bottom
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
line is the right to vote should be it's
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
a right but with that comes
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and the fact that we
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
manage this privilege and this right the
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
way we do is a travesty so that being
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
said i hope you will
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
really look at this as well as some of
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:21.510 align:start position:0%

believe your town is bedford is that
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
right that's correct okay because you
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
referenced it a couple of times that's
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
correct and i did and and for the record
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
i did um i did bring
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
my concerns to the attention
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
um there were other concerns as well but
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
it didn't relate to this bill
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm not speaking on it
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%

03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
the uh i i have to uh the the bill that
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
i introduced represented sweden this
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
morning i misspoke on um when i said
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
that the sec the language is in the
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
wrong section i was actually referring
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
to this bill um 110. um what this bill
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
does is it fixes a a unintentional
 
03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
loophole where the municipal voter
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
history is not included in the statewide
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
file that's available for purchase for
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
certain entities in the state
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
um it is entirely that as a housekeeping
 
03:34:36.790 --> 03:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill we will have it by we mean him
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
because i'm not on the bill there will
 
03:34:39.429 --> 03:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
be an amendment that comes forward that
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
moves us i believe to section four of
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
this rsa to address the issue of it
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
being in the wrong section but the the
 
03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
intent you know i think we can still
 
03:34:46.720 --> 03:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
intent you know i think we can still
have

03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:34:49.269 --> 03:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
a good hearing on the the intent and the
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
purpose um but that
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight on his end i will
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
not take credit for his mistake um
 
03:34:58.469 --> 03:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
is is already been notified and already
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
been addressed i think actually the
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office flagged it
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%

an opinion or a research factor i would
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
say it's uh i believe the office of the
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
research office did confirm that
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
so just looking at the fiscal note on
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
this it says it is a um
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
maybe there isn't one on this one never
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
mind maybe i got ahead of myself on
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
another bill correct there shouldn't be
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note on this because the
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
information is already in the statewide
 
03:36:01.279 --> 03:36:02.309 align:start position:0%
information is already in the statewide
database

03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that it is so
 
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of making it
 
03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:06.710 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of making it
available

03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
available
okay

03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:10.469 --> 03:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
03:36:12.479 --> 03:36:14.389 align:start position:0%

barry
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
see none
 
03:36:19.190 --> 03:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
all right it's
 
03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
tricia welcome
 
03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:34.870 --> 03:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair and honorable
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
members of the election law committee my
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
name is trisha pietso i'm with the
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
currently relative to house bill 1010
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that's going to be
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
forthcoming as representative barry
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
noted currently certain entities like
 
03:36:51.190 --> 03:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
the state parties those individuals that
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
are finally for office can obtain from
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
us election history from the secretary
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
of state plus the
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
voter list of registered voters
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
but the way that the law currently reads
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
is that they're only allowed to receive
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
the past two years state elections what
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
this would only modify is to include in
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
all the municipal elections that
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
currently the cities and towns currently
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
enter the history into the system so it
 
03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
would just be an addition to a move just
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
giving them a state history
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
of all those that have voted in the past
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
two years would also provide them the
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
municipal history now
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
most some municipal history would be a
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
two-year period because you have towns
 
03:37:34.309 --> 03:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
that have local elections every year you
 
03:37:36.070 --> 03:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
have a couple cities that do have local
 
03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
elections each year as well but most
 
03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
cities have it biennial so with that i
 
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions
 
03:37:45.429 --> 03:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
that the canadian may have
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
there was a comment made about the
 
03:37:56.550 --> 03:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
03:37:58.150 --> 03:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note to do some
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
initial programming changes but is that
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
your understanding of what it would be
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
limited to the the actual
 
03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:05.910 align:start position:0%
limited to the the actual
um

03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
providing of the information and how
 
03:38:09.990 --> 03:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's done is currently in place that is
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative terezian thank you madam
 
03:38:14.790 --> 03:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you man for taking the
 
03:38:14.800 --> 03:38:15.910 align:start position:0%
chair thank you man for taking the
question

03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes there is a fiscal note as is the
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
chair indicated um which looks like it's
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
a haver
 
03:38:21.680 --> 03:38:22.870 align:start position:0%
a haver
funded

03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
funded
 
03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
item so does that mean federal money
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
will pay for that there's a grant for
 
03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:29.269 align:start position:0%
will pay for that there's a grant for
that

03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility it depends with our
 
03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
vendor that we currently have if they
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
were to
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
we have so many hours of free service
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
for them for a year so if we could put
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
it within that it would be within that
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
if we don't have any other ongoing
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
projects otherwise than that it would be
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
through our health america vote act
 
03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:50.070 align:start position:0%
through our health america vote act
funds

03:38:50.070 --> 03:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.990 --> 03:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative so in either
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
event there would be no additional cost
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire taxpayer then is that
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct thank you
 
03:39:03.510 --> 03:39:03.520 align:start position:0%

speaking on hb
 
04:00:51.429 --> 04:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
1442 now the original version of the
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill what you have in front of you um is
 
04:00:56.469 --> 04:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about voter
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
checklists i have brought to you commit
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh committee amen or sorry an amendment
 
04:01:05.429 --> 04:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
an unapproved amendment and this would
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment would replace the bill
 
04:01:10.150 --> 04:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh be more towards what i
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
what the intent of the of my bill was
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
basically providing information for
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
election instructions and ballot
 
04:01:22.000 --> 04:01:22.790 align:start position:0%
election instructions and ballot
uh

04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
and ballots to be printed in uh up to
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
three different languages including
 
04:01:27.279 --> 04:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
three different languages including
english

04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
english
 
04:01:31.510 --> 04:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
what would trigger that is if somebody
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
if a district had a population of people
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
that spoke
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
more than uh three percent if three
 
04:01:39.750 --> 04:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
percent three percent of the people in
 
04:01:40.870 --> 04:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
that district
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
spoke a different language
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
um so if you
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
for example in a city like nashua where
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
the second highest language
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
spoken is spanish and about nine percent
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
of people of residents in
 
04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
nashville speak spanish
 
04:01:59.349 --> 04:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
this would then trigger trigger that it
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
would trigger the the clerk to reach out
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state um to let them
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
know if uh that that information be
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
provided in
 
04:02:11.670 --> 04:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
that language being spanish right now um
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
so this is you know i think our
 
04:02:16.150 --> 04:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
communities are changing our state is
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
becoming much more diverse
 
04:02:18.960 --> 04:02:19.830 align:start position:0%
becoming much more diverse
with

04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
racially and ethically diverse uh we
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
have people who are coming in with you
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
know speaking different languages
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
and so we want to make sure that they
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
have the right access to
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh to election materials um and i will
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
say you know while it is you know while
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
it would be good you know everyone speak
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
english i think you know i think back to
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
not just my own but many people who
 
04:02:50.070 --> 04:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know who who i've grown up with who
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
i and who are friends to me who've told
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
me you know i've been you know i've been
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
trans they've been translators when they
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
were 10 years old for their parents
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
at medical appointments um you know they
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
are citizens but they still don't have
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
the maximum proficiency of the language
 
04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
so you know one of the highest honors we
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
get to do as you know as american
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
citizens is we get the chance to vote um
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
and while
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know ten-year-old manny would have
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
loved to have followed his parents since
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
the voting booth and told them all right
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is you know this is this means uh
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
circle one box here or circle or fill in
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
one block here like you know i think
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
having that information in their native
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
language would go a long way to making
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
sure that you know we
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we provide that that we and
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a chance to vote and you
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
know that language isn't a barrier for
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
them so
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that y'all take a seriously
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
look a serious look at the amendment um
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's been handed out to you and i'm
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that you know y'all are able to
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment so that it would be
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know attached to the bill um
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise the bill on its own is
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know you'll probably replace headers
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
and change those into different
 
04:04:05.910 --> 04:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
languages but it's not as uh so the
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment really is kind of the
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
important part of the bill so with that
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm happy to take any
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you madam
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
chair just procedurally am i allowed to
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
ask questions about the amendment even
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
though it hasn't yes i'm going to allow
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
questions we've i am i am going to
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
support sponsors who bring in amendments
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
that are relevant to the bill for the
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
initial public hearing even though i
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
understand it has been not been noticed
 
04:04:34.150 --> 04:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
because i think it makes it easier for
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
the public and this in fact is sort of a
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
major change it would make no sense to
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
be asking questions about the original
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
bill and i will also assume that i will
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh committee member that is willing to
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment at the executive
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
session on this and so those are the
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
assumptions i'm making when we go
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
forward on that
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
um so yes proceed thank you madam chair
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative um
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
so i have two questions if that's okay
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
my first question is
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
um i was a spanish major like i speak
 
04:05:05.040 --> 04:05:06.309 align:start position:0%
um i was a spanish major like i speak
spanish

04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
spanish
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
but spanish isn't my primary language so
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the amendment and
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says that
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
if three percent or more it's their
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
primary language or if it's just three
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
percent speak that language so can you
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
can you clarify that for me yeah we
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
would determine it through the census um
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
and looking at census data they gather
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
that information of like primary
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
languages spoken so i think we would you
 
04:05:32.229 --> 04:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
know i would base this on census
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
information which we just you know we
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
just finished the 2020 census so we
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
should have that information
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
okay and then my follow-up is um
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the language and there's
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that says the ballot or
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
voted checklist has to be in english
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
must be in english
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh that the voter checklist has meaning
 
04:05:49.439 --> 04:05:50.229 align:start position:0%
uh that the voter checklist has meaning
the

04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
the language changes here if if the
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
three languages in a municipality the
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
top three are not english oh yeah um
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
what would happen with this legislation
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
like it doesn't always have to be in
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
english like at least um that's a good
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
well i'm just being forced no no no no
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's just funny because i think really
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
forward-looking yeah i think like back
 
04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
in the day like i think you would have
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
made a really good argument for like
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
having the ballot in french for example
 
04:06:18.150 --> 04:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
because we did have a strong french
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
canadian background like you know i
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
think it's waned out unfortunately and
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know i appreciate the their their
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
contributions to to our great state um
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
but that is
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that is a valid
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
question i think um
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean i don't foresee that
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
happening in the next
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
decade or even century but i'm hoping um
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
i mean that's why it says includes
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
english so
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that's i don't think
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
that'll be an issue but it could be
 
04:06:46.399 --> 04:06:47.110 align:start position:0%
that'll be an issue but it could be
wrong

04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative hayward
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
now thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
taking the question um
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
headers directions
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
those appear to be fairly simple
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
to execute
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
um but uh warn articles
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
04:07:08.479 --> 04:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh and
charter

04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
charter
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
how do you uh
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
feel that that'll be approached
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question um i
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
believe that we can that
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
you know we can find information to have
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
it translated um there are professional
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
translators out there who
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
who we can seek out i don't think it
 
04:07:34.150 --> 04:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
would be a high cost
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
and i think you know that would be
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
something that which is triggered if
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
there was a population that's three
 
04:07:40.630 --> 04:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
percent or more so you know if there
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
isn't then there's no need to worry
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
about that um but if there is i think
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
you know that's why we try to do it 90
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
days before the election so we try to
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
give ourselves some time so that we can
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
find the right translators and make sure
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
that it gets you know it gets done in a
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
timely fashion so
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
so would you be open to an amendment
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
about this about um
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
because we talked about primary
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
languages but there's many you know i
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
grew up in
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
houston which
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's it was actually the most diverse
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
city in the country a lot of people
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
don't know that
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
um obviously with the large hispanic
 
04:08:18.319 --> 04:08:19.670 align:start position:0%
um obviously with the large hispanic
population

04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:08:19.680 --> 04:08:21.030 align:start position:0%
population
um

04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:21.040 --> 04:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say in here pr it says
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
primary language but there's depends
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
people are bilingual will we be counting
 
04:08:27.199 --> 04:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
people are bilingual will we be counting
people

04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
that are bilingual in this or is just
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
any language other than english because
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
it could be you see what i'm saying it
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
could be unnecessary if someone speaks
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
english and spanish right we'd be
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
counting them i think right currently
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
when they're not they wouldn't
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be counted because
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
they speak english right
 
04:08:43.199 --> 04:08:44.469 align:start position:0%
they speak english right
so

04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
um i mean i think it's sorry i think you
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
know we're looking at the primary
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
language um and like i said that number
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
of nine percent of spanish speakers is
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
primary language in nashua um which is a
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
high number i'm like that i'm like damn
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
how do you sorry excuse my language i
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
apologize for using that word um but how
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
do you function you know making sure
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's your only language and then i
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
remember i'm like oh because you have a
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
10 year old son or 10 year old daughter
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
like myself that's translating your
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
information for your parents um but
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
i mean i i mean the bill is now with you
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
all so if y'all are are open to amending
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
it that's you know
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the all
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you madam
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
chair just one more um so the
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
their specific language that go on town
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
warrant articles um approved language um
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
would that cost to hire the translator
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
be picked up by the state or would the
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
municipality need to hire the translator
 
04:09:40.000 --> 04:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
municipality need to hire the translator
and

04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
how would that language like it's very
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
specific language that's approved so um
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
how would you
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
how would you envision this bill working
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah dra language
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i think you know
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
it goes down to the
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a war article i think you know
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have professional translators
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
who would who would do like you know
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's their job to do professional
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
translations and they do it for illegal
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know like there are legal
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
professions that use these these these
 
04:10:10.149 --> 04:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
services so i think you know i would
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
trust them
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
to do the best they can i think the cost
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
would probably go up
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
would probably be
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state but i can't
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know i can't be certain i like you
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
know like i can't
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so i think that's probably something
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
that would probably have to be like do a
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of work on representative
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
barry um so i don't i don't share the
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
concern about finding translators i
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be able to find
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
plenty of people to do that um probably
 
04:10:36.149 --> 04:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
some that would even do it for free
 
04:10:36.159 --> 04:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
some that would even do it for free
um

04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
on the your amendment here deals with
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
the printing of the ballot um to go you
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
know i represent manchester we have
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
charter amendments on occasion those
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
charter amendments can be very long um
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm bringing that up is
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know i know from my time studying
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
spanish that um the length of one
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
language is not always the length of
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
another um and that could create spatial
 
04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
issues on the ballot right so if you've
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
got you know the compute the the ocr
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
readers reads you know it's looking for
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
a fill-in at this point on the sheet and
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
it uses the black bars on the side as a
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
guiding point to figure out where that
 
04:11:10.800 --> 04:11:11.590 align:start position:0%
guiding point to figure out where that
is

04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:11:13.590 --> 04:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
if that moves is that and maybe this is
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
the question for the secondary states to
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
be fair this baby beyond you so
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
would that if that moves that
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if they factor that
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
into the fiscal note because if it moves
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
that bubble
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about a new ballot
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
arguably going into a different machine
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
um so i just think we need to take into
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
consideration those things but i don't
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get to that point which is
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
would it possibly move that would that
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note and you may not be
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
able to answer that and maybe a question
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
for the secretary of state's office to
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
be fair no i think that's i think it's a
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
really valid question um
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
and i think you know where
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
other states already have
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of you know
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
like have ballots translated in other
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
from in other languages
 
04:11:55.110 --> 04:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think we can pick up some
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
best practices i mean
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
texas i'm sure there are like they print
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
some some of the places print out
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
ballots in different languages because
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
they just at that point you're hitting
 
04:12:04.960 --> 04:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
they just at that point you're hitting
uh

04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
you're hit you're hitting a voting
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
rights act like you know threshold
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
so um so they're required to by law and
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
04:12:16.149 --> 04:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know we can definitely look at best
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
practices from other states to see uh to
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
see how they're doing it and whether or
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
not you know you have to replace you
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
know go about doing what you're what you
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%

representative for taking the question i
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
think i heard you say in testimony that
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
um currently about nine percent of the
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
national population is spanish-speaking
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
um what kind of help is available now
 
04:12:42.309 --> 04:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
for for
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
citizens when they go to vote is there
 
04:12:44.640 --> 04:12:45.910 align:start position:0%
citizens when they go to vote is there
um

04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
translators or is there um
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
some kind of help with the community
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
groups and so forth thank you for the
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
question that's a really that's a really
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
good question so
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
it depends it really depends on what
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
voting location you're at you know i
 
04:12:59.680 --> 04:13:00.550 align:start position:0%
voting location you're at you know i
think

04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
that in my district specifically they
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
typically i know that the the city clerk
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
works really hard to try to get
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
folks who speak you know who speak their
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh that language in that district's
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
being so being spanish like they are and
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes even portuguese they get
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who speaks that language to try
 
04:13:19.110 --> 04:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
to be there at the at the polling
 
04:13:19.120 --> 04:13:20.229 align:start position:0%
to be there at the at the polling
location

04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
location
 
04:13:20.239 --> 04:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
location
um

04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
but i've seen it in other polling
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
locations where they don't have somebody
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
who speaks that language and it becomes
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
really difficult especially when it
 
04:13:31.110 --> 04:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
comes to a you know a new registrant if
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's registering for the first
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
time maybe they just became a citizen
 
04:13:38.309 --> 04:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
um so it's you know it's it really
 
04:13:38.319 --> 04:13:39.750 align:start position:0%
um so it's you know it's it really
ranges

04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
ranges
 
04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's so it's not a uniform process it's
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
really kind of
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the city you know
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the town or city clerk
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
with the committee's indulgence i have a
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
couple of comments and questions because
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
i and i'm throwing this out there to see
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
if there's interest and whether or not
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to do a further amendment
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
um first of all i
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i could do a would you believe
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
but i i would you believe i might
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
disagree with the fact that translators
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
might be an issue because i can tell you
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
from a court perspective when we have
 
04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and we need a translator even
 
04:14:15.760 --> 04:14:16.630 align:start position:0%
hearings and we need a translator even
in

04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
a fairly common language it is quite dif
 
04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
it is not easy to get those translators
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact i might argue it was
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
easier to get them 15 years ago than it
 
04:14:28.229 --> 04:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
is now
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
and in that regards
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm this is hypothetical the court
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
translators are certified and they are
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
sworn under oath when you use them
 
04:14:43.110 --> 04:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand how you would use
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
just have people volunteering services
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
to do certification without some sort of
 
04:14:48.800 --> 04:14:51.670 align:start position:0%
to do certification without some sort of
um

04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of way to assure that the
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
translation was correct
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
i do think that this is a fiscal note
 
04:15:00.309 --> 04:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
but i think my guess is and somebody
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state's office
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
might come back i suspect it would be
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
one of those that would say
 
04:15:05.199 --> 04:15:06.630 align:start position:0%
one of those that would say
undeterminable

04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
undeterminable
 
04:15:06.640 --> 04:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
undeterminable
because

04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
um there is no way currently of
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
forecasting and
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
and that local ballots for your local
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
election are the responsibilities of our
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
municipality so i can see the secretary
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
of state's office arguing that if
 
04:15:22.630 --> 04:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
there's a translation requirement the
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
municipality would need to assume the
 
04:15:24.479 --> 04:15:25.429 align:start position:0%
municipality would need to assume the
cost

04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
of that because the secretary of state's
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
office is not involved in those local
 
04:15:32.229 --> 04:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
ballot preparations
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
finally i do actually have a question
 
04:15:37.110 --> 04:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
um how did you come up with the three
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
percent because it's my understanding
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
that the federal law voting rights act
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
actually kicks in for a language
 
04:15:45.750 --> 04:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
requirement at five percent
 
04:15:48.389 --> 04:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
so could you explain why it is different
 
04:15:48.399 --> 04:15:49.750 align:start position:0%
so could you explain why it is different
so

04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i can't believe all those things first
 
04:15:52.000 --> 04:15:53.189 align:start position:0%
i i can't believe all those things first
um

04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:55.110 --> 04:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for indulging me i can't
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
believe i can't believe because you're
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
you're right i think with like you know
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
especially with language that
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know you want to get it right on
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
these translations you don't want
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
something to you know to be lost
 
04:16:08.149 --> 04:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
so to speak lost in translation but you
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't want meaning to be lost so getting
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
certified folks
 
04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
it can be tough
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
so i can't believe that in terms of the
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
three percent i think
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know i used it as as just kind of a
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know a lower threshold but not
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
something where it's like you know one
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
percent or two percent i think i thought
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
three percent was just a little bit was
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
just the right size for it i do think
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know our our population is changing
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that we that we
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
change like you know that we are trying
 
04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
to accommodate for them as well um
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
but and you know i don't think and it
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
really ranges on the types of
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
communities so you know i don't there
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
are certain parts of the state where i'm
 
04:16:50.790 --> 04:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
like i don't know if we're ever gonna
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
need this um but you never know um and
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the exciting part
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
but the three percent i think is just
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
slightly below
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
the federal level and and so that's why
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
i was one with the three percent thank
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
coming here today i have a question
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
about that nine percent that i've been
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
thinking of and i apologize if it's
 
04:17:16.870 --> 04:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
already been answered nine what's the
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
nine percent the nine percent uh
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
population of nashua that speaks spanish
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
of that or is it nine percent maybe it's
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
the entirety but of that
 
04:17:30.870 --> 04:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
how what is the percentage of people
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
that speak spanish
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
exclusively and live their
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
entire life only speaking spanish right
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
i i don't know off the top uh thank you
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
for the question i don't know off the
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
top of my head um and you probably have
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
to really delve deep into it
 
04:17:48.479 --> 04:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
to really delve deep into it
um

04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's it really depends i
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
mean i have family members who or i
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
should not use my own personal anecdotal
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
evidence so there are folks out there
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
who will you know who go on and don't
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
ever feel the need to change you know to
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
learn the english language because they
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
are live in an enclave and it's you know
 
04:18:09.110 --> 04:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
all the services are provided for them
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
in that language because they're
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
surrounded by it
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh that's not to say that like you know
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
that there are communities in in new
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are like that are that
 
04:18:20.950 --> 04:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know uniform where you could
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
go about and not have to speak like
 
04:18:23.040 --> 04:18:23.910 align:start position:0%
go about and not have to speak like
english

04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
english
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
um but i will say i think you know i
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
think folks try to make the effort uh to
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
speak to learn english um
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:18:34.630 --> 04:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
if like once again now i will go in and
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
like that anecdotally i think they're
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
like growing up i remember seeing these
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
ads for for this translation service
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
called ingles
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
which means english without barriers and
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
like if you ever tell a latino kid about
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
inglesi marreras they're like boom like
 
04:18:49.990 --> 04:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll like set off like trigger be
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
like oh my god i remember those
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
commercials um but like there is you
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
know there's a concerted effort to like
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
try to learn um try to learn english try
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
to assimilate and try to
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
be a part of their community i but you
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
know i think
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
there it it takes time to learn english
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy language to learn um
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
and we are we're lucky because we get to
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
spend you know k through 12 learning it
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
um but i and that's not to say uh
 
04:19:19.110 --> 04:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
spanish is any easier but i think that
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think i think people new
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
americans and immigrants do try to make
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
a concerted effort to learn english
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that by the
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
time you know if they're in the middle
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
of that process that they can get to
 
04:19:30.080 --> 04:19:31.429 align:start position:0%
of that process that they can get to
vote

04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that they in a language that they
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
04:19:44.189 --> 04:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
um on the onset of this
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i did not i haven't seen the amendment
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i was going based on the original
 
04:20:08.880 --> 04:20:10.830 align:start position:0%
so i was going based on the original
um

04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
1442. with just including the
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
supervisors checklist but um a couple of
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
things that i have concerns about
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
is the fact that this information on
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
what three languages that we're going to
 
04:20:25.600 --> 04:20:26.550 align:start position:0%
what three languages that we're going to
choose

04:20:26.550 --> 04:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
choose
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
is actually going to be taken by the
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
census figures the united states census
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
figures include citizens non-citizens
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
legal residents non-citizen long-term
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
visitors and undocumented immigrants
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
so in that by itself
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's we
 
04:20:42.399 --> 04:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
it's we
only

04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
citizens are allowed to vote
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
but we're going to take non-citizen
 
04:20:48.720 --> 04:20:50.149 align:start position:0%
but we're going to take non-citizen
information

04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
and determine what language should be on
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
our ballots that's a problem for me
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
the town of bedford does very well
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
is that they have
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
the instructions for the ballots the
 
04:21:07.110 --> 04:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
ballots are all in english but the
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
instructions on how to complete a ballot
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
and how to go through the process any
 
04:21:13.110 --> 04:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
warrant articles or anything like that
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
the instructions themselves are
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
available in every language
 
04:21:18.479 --> 04:21:20.389 align:start position:0%
available in every language
written

04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
so this solves the problem as
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
the committee chair mentioned with
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
regards to translators i worked with a
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
minority population for a long time and
 
04:21:32.950 --> 04:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
translators are not only hard to find
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
but they're extremely expensive
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing is translators come with
 
04:21:40.469 --> 04:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
ideas and ideals so
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
unless it's a unless it's a
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
certified translator you don't know what
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
that translator is telling the
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
prospective voter um so that's a problem
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
they are also very expensive
 
04:21:57.120 --> 04:21:58.550 align:start position:0%
they are also very expensive
um

04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
it only it would only be one day an
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
election cycle but
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
by how many how um
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
how many towns and municipalities
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing with regards to this is
 
04:22:12.800 --> 04:22:15.670 align:start position:0%
the other thing with regards to this is
that

04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
personally the one thing i like about
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it would create
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
problems on the ballot and we'd have to
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
go to hand count
 
04:22:23.600 --> 04:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
go to hand count
personally

04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
personally
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
there was something else
 
04:22:35.600 --> 04:22:43.110 align:start position:0%
there was something else
uh

04:22:43.110 --> 04:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
i think that i'll just i'll just end
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
with that and but like i said my biggest
 
04:22:49.830 --> 04:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
issue with that is is if we're going to
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
generate what generate um
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
what languages we use from census
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
information i think that's
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
not appropriate
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
thanks also signed up to speak on this
 
04:23:16.229 --> 04:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so i would like
 
04:23:20.080 --> 04:23:20.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so i would like
if

04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
you could go to the website
 
04:23:23.760 --> 04:23:27.990 align:start position:0%
you could go to the website
doj.nh.gov

04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
and look on it
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
and the first thing you see
 
04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
is the flag
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
on this website
 
04:23:36.670 --> 04:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
is china's flag
 
04:23:36.680 --> 04:23:38.149 align:start position:0%
is china's flag
[Music]

04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
so back to your question about
 
04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
is english going to be official on this
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
checklist that is my question too
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
because i don't see anywhere on this
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
department of justice website the
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
american flag
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
but we see the china flag on it
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
besides french
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh france and um
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
other languages i don't i don't
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
recognize the flag
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i only discovered this during the
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
windham audit
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
like what is china flex doing here this
 
04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire website
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i put it on facebook and everybody's
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
like whoa
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
they call the
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been fixed so if this coming
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
to law
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
is all the towns in new hampshire gonna
 
04:24:24.159 --> 04:24:25.269 align:start position:0%
is all the towns in new hampshire gonna
have

04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
certain flags like this show up on their
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
their website
 
04:24:32.229 --> 04:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
so i feel like i'm in china
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this website we're not in new
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire anymore that's one problem
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
that i have with this bill
 
04:24:38.880 --> 04:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
that i have with this bill
second

04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
is as you said about the cost
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter who pay if somebody
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is going to pay for this
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
i've been translating
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
in court hospital
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
in other places that you name it
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that in many
 
04:24:58.080 --> 04:24:59.349 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that in many
courtrooms

04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
courtrooms
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
even people that provided by
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
professional translation company
 
04:25:04.960 --> 04:25:06.710 align:start position:0%
professional translation company
certified

04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
certified
 
04:25:08.470 --> 04:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
but translate completely wrong
 
04:25:08.480 --> 04:25:09.590 align:start position:0%
but translate completely wrong

04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
in court and i can see it
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
i can hear it and one of the defendant
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
criminal that if he's convicted he's
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
going to have to go to prison for a very
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
long time
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
he opposed because the person couldn't
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
even speak the language that he supposed
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
to translate fluently how could she
 
04:25:29.920 --> 04:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
to translate fluently how could she
understand

04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
what he had to say to defend himself
 
04:25:37.110 --> 04:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
see so if the
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
was certified we already have problems
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
never mind the volunteers
 
04:25:43.189 --> 04:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
been helping a lot of people in
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts into election and stuff
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
like that and they see the post and all
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff and like roxanne said
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
the people that translate they held
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
their own mind and their own ideals and
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
who knows that who they tell to go to
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
vote so i also help a lot of people to
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
go translate and vote here in the state
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
of course i tell them to go vote
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
republicans because i'm a republican
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't tell them to go vote for
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
the democrats or other parties
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
so how do you control that
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
so we don't have problem
 
04:26:21.770 --> 04:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
why do we create a problem
 
04:26:21.780 --> 04:26:22.950 align:start position:0%
why do we create a problem
[Music]

04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:22.960 --> 04:26:23.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully asking you to
 
04:26:26.399 --> 04:26:27.349 align:start position:0%
i would respectfully asking you to
please

04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't create more problems because
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that translator interpreter
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
created during the election or in the
 
04:26:36.560 --> 04:26:37.990 align:start position:0%
created during the election or in the
translation

04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
translation
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
who's gonna pay for the liability when
 
04:26:44.550 --> 04:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
it goes to uh in the litigation who's
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
paying for that the taxpayer is paying
 
04:26:47.670 --> 04:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:26:49.590 --> 04:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're done paying for it
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much for listening
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%

name please my name is suzanne corby
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you ceo rby i live in manchester
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i am part of an organization called
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
welcoming manchester that's affiliated
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
with the state organization welcoming
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
and our mission is to welcome immigrants
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
and to make our cities and our state
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
as welcoming a place
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
as we can for immigrants because we
 
04:28:02.229 --> 04:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
having immigrants and welcoming
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
immigrants is a
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
win-win situation
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
people get to come here they get
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
economic opportunity they get safety
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
from disaster and war
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
and we get workers really competent
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
workers all along the line particularly
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
if you look in our nursing homes and
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals and rehab facilities you're
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
going to see a lot of immigrants working
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we believe that we need in return to
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
make them
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
as comfortable as possible
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
now becoming a citizen is a great
 
04:28:35.439 --> 04:28:36.469 align:start position:0%
now becoming a citizen is a great
milestone

04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
milestone
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
and people feel proud they work to do it
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
they feel proud of their success
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
but the second milestone is voting
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
because there's only two rights
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
that only citizens have one is to vote
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
and one is to serve on a jury so once
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
you become a citizen you
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
many people want to exercise that right
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
04:28:58.479 --> 04:28:59.189 align:start position:0%
to vote
now

04:28:59.189 --> 04:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
people will ask
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
if they become citizens don't they speak
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
english yes they speak english
 
04:29:05.920 --> 04:29:07.030 align:start position:0%
english yes they speak english
the

04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
expectation of reading
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
is lower
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
um and we don't have literacy tests for
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
native-born citizens either
 
04:29:16.560 --> 04:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
native-born citizens either
um

04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:18.080 --> 04:29:19.670 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
the the reading level is generally okay
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
but when you start to read
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
complex material like how to register to
 
04:29:27.840 --> 04:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
complex material like how to register to
vote

04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:29:31.830 --> 04:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
the form how to register to vote
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot form and those
 
04:29:34.479 --> 04:29:35.670 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot form and those
directions

04:29:35.670 --> 04:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
directions
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
those are complicated they're
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
complicated for native english speakers
 
04:29:40.720 --> 04:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
complicated for native english speakers
and

04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
people don't feel comfortable
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing that in their second language
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
they need to have their first language
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
to make them feel comfortable it's not
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
only a welcoming gesture but it is also
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
an important
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
way in which we can give people
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
i was involved with
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
an effort in the manchester city
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
election in 2021
 
04:30:15.510 --> 04:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
where we
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
had um
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
information printed translated
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
and printed
 
04:30:21.040 --> 04:30:22.309 align:start position:0%
and printed
on

04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
now we can't take these forms and tran
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh translate them that's not allowed
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
that has to go through the secretary of
 
04:30:29.520 --> 04:30:30.469 align:start position:0%
that has to go through the secretary of
state

04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm hoping that this
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill will do
 
04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
but we did take the information in plain
 
04:30:36.880 --> 04:30:38.070 align:start position:0%
but we did take the information in plain
english

04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
english
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
and five other languages and had it
 
04:30:43.590 --> 04:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
translated and we chose those languages
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
based on what the translating companies
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
often most often got we didn't use the
 
04:30:48.720 --> 04:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
often most often got we didn't use the
census

04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
census
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
but the requests that they almost they
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
most often got
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
this was very well received it was used
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
by candidates
 
04:31:00.790 --> 04:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
and it was used by
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.189 --> 04:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
but what would really enhance this would
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
be to actually get those forms that you
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
fill out the registration form
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the absentee ballot form and any
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
other form and i don't think there's a
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
lot of them and i don't think the cost
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.269 --> 04:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is not interpretation it's not
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
having anybody go in and speak for you
 
04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
this is paper translation
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
and that's usually about sixty dollars a
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
page maybe seventy five dollars a page
 
04:31:37.110 --> 04:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
you choose um
 
04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
a few of the most important documents
 
04:31:41.830 --> 04:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
and the most important languages
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cost a lot
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's not only a way to be
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
friendly and welcoming
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
but it allows people to do to fulfill
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative derozan thank you madam
 
04:32:02.080 --> 04:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
representative derozan thank you madam
chair

04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:32:03.279 --> 04:32:04.070 align:start position:0%
chair
and

04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
this may also be a question for the
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state i don't know but
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
thanks man for taking the question
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
is there anything in current law do you
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
know or what's the process in manchester
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
for town clerks that want to do this on
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
does manchester do a ballot no spanish
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's english only no and that's i guess
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
probably a question
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
for the secretary of state it would have
 
04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be approved by the secretary of state
 
04:32:28.880 --> 04:32:29.910 align:start position:0%
to be approved by the secretary of state
so

04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
and we did actually in 2016 request
 
04:32:35.429 --> 04:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
write a letter to the secretary of state
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
and make that request and it was denied
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
but it was right before the election you
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
know there wasn't a lot of time there
 
04:32:44.710 --> 04:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of budget left
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:32:49.349 --> 04:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
this law wasn't in effect uh
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
so you know they didn't have to do it
 
04:32:51.760 --> 04:32:52.630 align:start position:0%
so you know they didn't have to do it
and

04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:52.640 --> 04:32:53.429 align:start position:0%
and
uh

04:32:53.429 --> 04:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
but we can't just a private group can't
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
just take that
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
registration form and translate it it it
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be approved
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
by this it needs to come through the
 
04:33:04.400 --> 04:33:05.510 align:start position:0%
by this it needs to come through the
state

04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:33:07.029 --> 04:33:07.039 align:start position:0%

electronically to provide a remote
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
testimonial position on the bill
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
and signing up in support of it where

persons indicating
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%

and four opposed um and i'm just to say
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know these committee hearings have
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
been fairly small but the blue sheet is
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
really to indicate if you're not
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
speaking because
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
if you speak them we sort of register
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
your opinion twice which is fine as a
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
committee we can certainly manage that
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to close the
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on 1442.
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
uh next scheduled for hearing is 1496.

hb1496 is requiring political
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to make voter checklists
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%

checklist and um
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know she she's a mom of three uh she
 
04:35:26.709 --> 04:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have a whole lot of time to do it
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
but she came up with 1500
 
04:35:28.799 --> 04:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
but she came up with 1500
um

04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:31.349 --> 04:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
people that were registered to vote in
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
derry that weren't there anymore you
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
know through death throughout the
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
removing some had been gone for five
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
years uh things like that then then they
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
did the ten year purge and found another
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
six thousand
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%

04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
because i didn't mean to
 
04:37:05.680 --> 04:37:06.869 align:start position:0%
because i didn't mean to
um

04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
were you aware then that when the
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
checklist is created at the city or town
 
04:37:14.629 --> 04:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
level it's done so an election net in
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
pdf form or in a comma delimited file
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the secretary of state has access to
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
that electronic checklist already so
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no need for the clerks to
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
create one and then send it up to the
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
and the the second part of this bill
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
um the second part of the this bill is
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
to make it available to any citizen at
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
no cost
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know to press a button on a computer
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't cost you know 75 dollars
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're not in the business of
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
making money we're we're in the business
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
of keeping elections clean okay thank
 
04:37:48.240 --> 04:37:49.750 align:start position:0%
of keeping elections clean okay thank
you

04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%

thank you further questions for
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak for this bill is
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chairman and
 
04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%

04:38:19.119 --> 04:38:20.629 align:start position:0%
former representative or am a former

04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking for myself
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill for six reasons
 
04:38:27.680 --> 04:38:28.470 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill for six reasons
um

04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:28.480 --> 04:38:30.150 align:start position:0%
um
first

04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:38:30.160 --> 04:38:31.189 align:start position:0%
first
uh

04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
should it pass
 
04:38:34.869 --> 04:38:34.879 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
as you know if it passes anyone can get
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
a copy of the check the public checklist
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state in
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
electronic form
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that would be for the entire state
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
basically for every single community in
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
while the law currently says that you
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
cannot use these checklists for
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
commercial purposes i think it would be
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
rather naive of the legislature to
 
04:38:55.039 --> 04:38:56.230 align:start position:0%
rather naive of the legislature to
believe

04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:38:56.240 --> 04:38:57.349 align:start position:0%
believe
that

04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
some people wouldn't take advantage of
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
this to get copies of these lists and
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
sell them to data miners and others
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
so as a practical matter not a legal
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
matter but it's a practical matter if
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
all of us would be receiving a great
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
deal more junk mail
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps junk telephone calls
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
but it would be an intrusion on
 
04:39:24.150 --> 04:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
most people that they would find to be
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
very surprising and unnecessary
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
um because they've chosen to exercise
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
their right to vote
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
and now
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
they become part of some
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
data miners database
 
04:39:39.350 --> 04:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
there are many people in this state who
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
have registered to vote and many people
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
who haven't this would discourage those
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
people who haven't from registering to
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
vote because one of the consequences is
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to know this and as i
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
said a moment ago
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
you will get be getting all sorts of
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
junk mail etc as a result of your
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
decision to go public in this manner
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
under the bill
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
should you decide to register and vote
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
if you read the fiscal note
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
most of a hundred thousand dollars will
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
be lost to cities and towns
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
right now the cities and towns get some
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
money from the secretary of state
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
and um that would go away under this
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill because there would be no charges
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
for this information in effect if you
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of this bill you're
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
raising local property taxes now i'll
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
admit that it's a trivial amount
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
overall a hundred thousand out of
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars that we collect in
 
04:40:37.590 --> 04:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
state taxes in my town of where which
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
has a population of nine thousand uh our
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
town clerk said um if this bill were to
 
04:40:43.360 --> 04:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
town clerk said um if this bill were to
pass

04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
as of 2021 the town of ware would have
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
lost 463
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
now that isn't a lot of money
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that i hope this
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislature wouldn't want to put on
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:05.040 --> 04:41:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
fourth

04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
04:41:07.360 --> 04:41:08.628 align:start position:0%
fourth
this

04:41:08.628 --> 04:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
a violation of the recently passed
 
04:41:15.270 --> 04:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
informational privacy amendment
 
04:41:15.280 --> 04:41:16.230 align:start position:0%
informational privacy amendment
that's

04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
2b in our constitution part 1 section 2b
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
which says uh government intrusion into
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
there is no justification that i can
 
04:41:33.670 --> 04:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
think of for expanding this that would
 
04:41:33.680 --> 04:41:35.030 align:start position:0%
think of for expanding this that would
overcome

04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
the privacy interests which that
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
this also may be an unfunded mandate
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you read the fiscal note the
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
municipal association says that cities
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
and towns are going to have to come up
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
with some way to create an electronic
 
04:42:04.320 --> 04:42:05.430 align:start position:0%
with some way to create an electronic
spreadsheet

04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
beyond what they're already doing by
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
sending information in electronic form
 
04:42:09.520 --> 04:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
sending information in electronic form
to

04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:42:13.110 --> 04:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state no amount is
 
04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
specified and certainly i suspect it's
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be a huge amount but again
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
it would be a requirement that the state
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
is imposing on
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities without paying for it in
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
violation of article 28a
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
this bill may violate the federal
 
04:42:32.958 --> 04:42:34.788 align:start position:0%
this bill may violate the federal
constitution

04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
you know there's a section in the bill
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
section two that says only new hampshire
 
04:42:38.958 --> 04:42:39.990 align:start position:0%
section two that says only new hampshire
residents

04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
residents
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
can get this information
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
now that means that the secretary of
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
state is going to have to do two things
 
04:42:48.150 --> 04:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
first of all require me to identify
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
myself and prove that i'm a new
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
give me this so the secretary of state
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
will now have a list of everybody
 
04:42:59.350 --> 04:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
who acquire who requested this
 
04:42:59.360 --> 04:43:01.350 align:start position:0%
who acquire who requested this
information

04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
that's a problem because it's an
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary intrusion into personal
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
privacy especially under the right to
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
know law since you can get information
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh without identifying yourself but
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
here's the constant the federal
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue
 
04:43:14.000 --> 04:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue
um

04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.400 --> 04:43:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
article

04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
article
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
4 section 2 clause 1 the citizens of
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
each state shall be entitled to all
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
privileges and immunities of citizens in
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
the several states
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
in other words one k state cannot
 
04:43:30.868 --> 04:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
discriminate in favor of its citizens
 
04:43:33.030 --> 04:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
and against those citizens of other
 
04:43:33.040 --> 04:43:35.110 align:start position:0%
and against those citizens of other
states

04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
in this case the discrimination is we
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
only allow new hampshire residents to
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
get this information and not
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
residents of other states
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
conclude by citing a very interesting
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court decision where the
 
04:43:49.840 --> 04:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court decision where the
appellant

04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
appellant
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
in this case a vermont woman this was in
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
the early 1980s a veront woman took and
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
passed the new hampshire bar association
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
and went to the supreme court to become
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
a member of the new hampshire bar
 
04:44:09.910 --> 04:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
the supreme court said sorry you can't
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
become a member because we only allow
 
04:44:13.830 --> 04:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents to become
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
members of the bar
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
the supreme court said sorry you can't
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
do that that violates the privileges and
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
immunity clause and here was their their
 
04:44:22.000 --> 04:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
immunity clause and here was their their
statement

04:44:23.670 --> 04:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm quoting we conclude that new
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar's residency requirement
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
violates the privileges and immunity
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
clause of article 4 section 2 of the
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
united states constitution
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
the non-residents interested in
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
practicing law is a quote privilege
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
unquote protected by the clause
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
although the lawyer is quote an officer
 
04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the court unquote he does not hold a
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
position that can be entrusted only to a
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
full-fledged member of the political
 
04:44:47.760 --> 04:44:48.868 align:start position:0%
full-fledged member of the political
community

04:44:48.868 --> 04:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
a state may discriminate against
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
non-residents only where its reasons are
 
04:44:52.718 --> 04:44:54.230 align:start position:0%
non-residents only where its reasons are
substantial

04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the difference in treatment bears a
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
close or substantial relationship to
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
those reasons no such showing has been
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
made in this case
 
04:45:04.948 --> 04:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
and so the new hampshire supreme court's
 
04:45:04.958 --> 04:45:06.150 align:start position:0%
and so the new hampshire supreme court's
ruling

04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
or requirement that a member of the bar
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
be a resident in new hampshire was
 
04:45:09.360 --> 04:45:10.628 align:start position:0%
be a resident in new hampshire was
overturned

04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
overturned
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's analogous to the
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
situation we have here there's no
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
justification for limiting this
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
information only to new hampshire
 
04:45:17.120 --> 04:45:18.788 align:start position:0%
information only to new hampshire
residents

04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
residents
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
so i believe that if a case were to be
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
brought this
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
or at least the second part of this bill
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
would fail for a violation for being in
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
violation of the federal constitution
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
madam chairman that concludes my
 
04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
testimony i'd be pleased to answer any

representative barry uh miss matt i have
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
a series of questions um first which

thank you for being here representative
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
kirk i didn't have the pledge to start
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
with you but you're uh to echo the
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
chairman sentiment your
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
passion for privacy issues is well known
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
and a legacy that has out out currently
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
outliving your tenure as a former state
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative so congratulations on
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
that front and a minimum
 
04:46:28.080 --> 04:46:28.948 align:start position:0%
that front and a minimum
um

04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
first question is do you believe that
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
voter information is public information
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
certain information is public
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
information we acquire all sorts of
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
information from a person in order to
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
register to vote including where you're
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
born where you were naturalized the name
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the court i mean all sorts of
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
information that
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
probably is not relevant to the public
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
but it certainly is relevant to the
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
public that
 
04:46:56.070 --> 04:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
the names of people who have registered
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
who are registered to vote be known and
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
available to them in some format in some
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
form okay so and i guess you're getting
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
to the heart of what my next question
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
was because i heard about how smart you
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
were and you're showing that
 
04:47:07.920 --> 04:47:09.670 align:start position:0%
were and you're showing that
um

04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
currently i can go into the any town
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
clerk office any city clerk office ask
 
04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
to see the checklist and and thumb
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
through it and i think in manchester you
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
can even get pdf copies of it for an
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amount of money um
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
what's the difference here i mean if
 
04:47:25.510 --> 04:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is a privacy issue right and i can
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
currently see this information
 
04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
right and there's really nothing stop
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't happen right but i could in
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
theory walk into
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
the town clerk's office start
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
transcribing this onto a piece of paper
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
how is
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out how
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
turning it into a spreadsheet all of a
 
04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
sudden makes it i get it makes it more
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
accessible but i understand like from a
 
04:47:45.910 --> 04:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
privacy perspective how does that
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
turn it into i don't want to say
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
violation but infringement maybe
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think you answered your own question
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's a question of how accessible if
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
everything is on a time square bulletin
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
board and that's what you mean by public
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
public access
 
04:48:01.520 --> 04:48:02.708 align:start position:0%
public access
then

04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:48:07.270 --> 04:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
not just a degree but a but a totally
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
different situation than if you have to
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
go to 300 234 separate town
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions get something on a piece
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
of paper
 
04:48:19.030 --> 04:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
put it into in in your home some sort of
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
electronic format and then disseminate
 
04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
it or use it that's that's a totally
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
different situation
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
from what's proposed under this bill
 
04:48:29.990 --> 04:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
which basically is the entire checklist
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
is available easily available electronic
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
form can be used for any
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter can be used for
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
any purpose
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
i see that as enormous difference
 
04:48:42.070 --> 04:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
between the current situation and that's
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
why i'm here it it
 
04:48:46.550 --> 04:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's a order of magnitude not just
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
an order of degree difference
 
04:48:50.550 --> 04:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative alexander thank you madam
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you um honorable kirk um
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
so my question is um political parties
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
already have access to this information
 
04:49:00.480 --> 04:49:02.788 align:start position:0%
already have access to this information
um

04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't the public
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
the i don't believe that the political
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
party should have access to it and i
 
04:49:18.550 --> 04:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
was unsuccessful in preventing that from
 
04:49:18.560 --> 04:49:19.910 align:start position:0%
was unsuccessful in preventing that from
happening

04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't want to see an error
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
compounded by making this information
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
more accessible
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think we have
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
and have had for a number of years a
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
relatively fragile situation with
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
respect to voters you know all of the
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
voting controversy that's going on in
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
various states including new hampshire
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
and in congress
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that voters feel as
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable as pos people residents feel
 
04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
as comfortable as possible
 
04:49:48.550 --> 04:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
with not only becoming voters
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
but actually voting
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that to the extent one of
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the prices that we pay for registering
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
to vote and voting is that everybody
 
04:50:01.270 --> 04:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
easily knows what we've done and when
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
we've done it not who we voted for
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
um that that that kind of um
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary publicity
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be a deterrent to
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
some folks
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
exercising uh their rights as as
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
citizens and so i'm trying to
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
prevent that and i think this bill
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
goes in that direction it's not a huge
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
step but it's another step and
 
04:50:27.750 --> 04:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think we the legislature ought
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
to go in that direction
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%

dave love for putting this bill in
 
04:51:13.680 --> 04:51:14.550 align:start position:0%
dave love for putting this bill in
after

04:51:14.550 --> 04:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:51:14.560 --> 04:51:16.868 align:start position:0%
after
the

04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
issues that arose in november of 2003
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
with elections across the country
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of concerns by a lot of
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
people not all those concerns were valid
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
maybe some of them were maybe they're
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
not but
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for people
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
to actually get in look at
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
get the information and be able to
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not there were
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be addressed
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative barry that
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a privacy issue you didn't
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
use those words but
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
what he said was
 
04:51:55.110 --> 04:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
that this information is already
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
available publicly
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
but it's difficult to get you have to go
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
to every town
 
04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
and you have to get the checklist from
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
every town you have to pay for that
 
04:52:07.830 --> 04:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
republican party and the democrat party
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
have access to these lists already
 
04:52:14.080 --> 04:52:14.948 align:start position:0%
have access to these lists already
now

04:52:14.948 --> 04:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
sound like i'm talking down to anybody
 
04:52:18.400 --> 04:52:19.510 align:start position:0%
sound like i'm talking down to anybody
but

04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire constitution defines
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
we the people as the government all
 
04:52:28.230 --> 04:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
power resides in the people in article 8
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then our magistrates and officers
 
04:52:32.070 --> 04:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
are our substitutes at all time
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
accountable to us
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
so why should
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
the two parties have access to
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
information easily accessed information
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
that is very very difficult for us to
 
04:52:43.040 --> 04:52:43.990 align:start position:0%
that is very very difficult for us to
get

04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
and very costly for us to get as well
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
i agree with the issue that
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
brought up about
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
too many people on the ballot those
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
those not on the ballot on the checklist
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
they need to get purged
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
and not
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
all of the supervisors of the checklist
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
do their jobs
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:53:10.470 --> 04:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
a woman in windham who was awesome
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
she was elected about 10 years ago and
 
04:53:14.948 --> 04:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
she purged thousands of names from from
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
our checklist
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
if if people aren't
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
um eligible to vote their name shouldn't
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
be on the checklist
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:30.550 --> 04:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
the reason to have it in a spreadsheet
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
format is because it makes it easy
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
to use
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
from an end user's point of view we can
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
sort it
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
we can make better use of the data
 
04:53:43.440 --> 04:53:45.270 align:start position:0%
we can make better use of the data
um

04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:47.190 --> 04:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
the reason to have the towns do the work
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
instead of the state is because it
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
really reduces the the burden of the
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
state having to do that
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
i actually met with secretary gardner
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
last year to talk about this bill
 
04:53:57.760 --> 04:53:59.430 align:start position:0%
last year to talk about this bill
specifically

04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
and you know he suggested that it would
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
not be difficult for them to post these
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
on the website if if that were the case
 
04:54:08.080 --> 04:54:10.708 align:start position:0%
on the website if if that were the case
um

04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
i want to address the cost issue and i
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
agree with um
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
with the honorable
 
04:54:17.440 --> 04:54:18.550 align:start position:0%
with the honorable
kirk

04:54:18.550 --> 04:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
kirk
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
that uh you know towns might lose money
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
but it's minimal we're talking about
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
voter integrity
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
there are issues there are concerns
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
of many people in our country across our
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
country but even in this state as to
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not every vote is being cast
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
properly and if it's being cast by
 
04:54:38.070 --> 04:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
legal voters
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
so if it's a few hundred dollars per
 
04:54:42.628 --> 04:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
town when you divide that out across all
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
the residents in the town all the
 
04:54:45.990 --> 04:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
properties in the town you're talking
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
about a dollar less than a dollar
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
aren't helping to ensure the integrity
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
of our elections worth that if you're
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to put a price on the value of our
 
04:54:55.680 --> 04:54:57.830 align:start position:0%
going to put a price on the value of our
elections

04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's not really a price that's
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
that's really should even be considered
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
because it's it's nothing it's pennies
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
the state database i just confirmed this
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
with secretary of state
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
scamland the state database already
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
produces a spreadsheet
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
so the financial
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
note in here which says that the towns
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
would have to buy software is not true
 
04:55:22.550 --> 04:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
they have access to the electronic
 
04:55:24.868 --> 04:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
voter system and they can produce the
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet through that
 
04:55:29.430 --> 04:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
they can then send that file it's a csv
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
file which is the spreadsheet format and
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
they can send that up to the secretary
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
of state
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just take a quick a brief
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
moment to address some of the issues
 
04:55:38.320 --> 04:55:39.110 align:start position:0%
moment to address some of the issues
that

04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
the honorable kirk had brought up
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
because i disagree with
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i did bring the first one was
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you can already get copies going
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
from going from each town to each town
 
04:55:57.360 --> 04:55:58.948 align:start position:0%
from going from each town to each town
individually

04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
individually
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
but again that makes that makes it
 
04:56:02.708 --> 04:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
difficult for someone like myself who is
 
04:56:04.390 --> 04:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
very concerned about voter integrity
 
04:56:06.390 --> 04:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
from actually going through that process
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
why should i have to do that
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is public information it should be
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
available to me publicly i should be
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
able to go and if you don't want to
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
transfer this over to my town clerk up
 
04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state's office let
 
04:56:22.470 --> 04:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
me get change this and let me get all
 
04:56:24.150 --> 04:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
that information for every town from my
 
04:56:25.510 --> 04:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
town clerk
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
all that's doing is throwing a roadblock
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
in my way as a citizen
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
whereas you as elected representatives
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have that roadblock that
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me because i say
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
this with the utmost of respect because
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
i know you make a huge amount of money
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
but you know your public servants
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
right i know you're here to do the right
 
04:56:49.990 --> 04:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing but you're here to serve us don't
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that it would
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
discourage people from registering to
 
04:56:57.360 --> 04:56:58.868 align:start position:0%
discourage people from registering to
vote

04:56:58.868 --> 04:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's part of the price of being a
 
04:57:01.360 --> 04:57:02.470 align:start position:0%
that's part of the price of being a
citizen

04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
and casting a vote
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
you register in the town
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's already public information i'm not
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
asking for somebody's date of birth i'm
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
not asking for all the fields
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm only asking for the for the data
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would be given to me if i went to
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
my town clerk
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i asked for voter checklist in a
 
04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note i think i talked about
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
may be a violation of inform of
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
information privacy
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
this is already public information
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
i can already access it
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's a non-founded mandate you don't
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
they won't have to buy any software
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
so they already have the ability to do
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
this if i went to my town and i asked
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
using a right to know request i could
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
already get a spreadsheet so i'm only
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
asking you to make this easier for me to
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
not have to go from town to town to town
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
and it may
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
violate federal
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
constitution because only new hampshire
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
residents can get the info well
 
04:58:04.948 --> 04:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
i can go
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i can go to any town
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
using the right to know law and i can
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
get a copy of the voter checklist i
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell them who i am i don't
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
even have to write any information about
 
04:58:16.948 --> 04:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
myself i could just go there and i can
 
04:58:18.550 --> 04:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
make the request and they have to honor
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
that request
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
a laws already allow me to do all of
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
this i'm just asking you to make it
 
04:58:26.230 --> 04:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
easier for me
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%

04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%

04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
copy of the voter checklist unless the
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
the parties are the entities that can
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
get them am i confusing myself no i can
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
go to my town clerk i can i can put in a
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
request and i can ask her to give me a

04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
looks like suzanne has left
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%

04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
has already been provided to you as
 
04:59:34.628 --> 04:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron and others have
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this information it's already
 
04:59:38.788 --> 04:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
currently available at any city or town
 
04:59:43.590 --> 04:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
clerk's office matter of fact rsa 654 31
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
normal numeral tools which allows the
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to go ahead and provide
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
this information to any residents coming
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
into their
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
clerk's offices there is a fee involved
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
as stated in the fiscal note and
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
everything like that these monies that
 
05:00:00.628 --> 05:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
as far as the statewide checklists that
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
are collected
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
from the party affiliations for those
 
05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
that are getting it through the party go
 
05:00:08.550 --> 05:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
back to the cities and towns but
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
individually any city in town when
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
somebody is going into the city and town
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
to purchase this list but also then they
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
would also be losing it internally as
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
well they wouldn't necessarily be coming
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the state they can also do it whether
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's a state rep somebody finding out
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
filing for alderman or a mayor that
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
would like to purchase a statewide list
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
they will lose the revenues from that as
 
05:00:30.240 --> 05:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
they will lose the revenues from that as
well

05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
one note i would like to make on this
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
too is that within this it states that
 
05:00:39.910 --> 05:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
it shall be available in a spreadsheet
 
05:00:42.550 --> 05:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
form to the secretary of state and that
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
checklist so corrected shall be used at
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
an election if it's applied to that that
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
means this would only applying six to 13
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
days before an election and not when a
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist has an other
 
05:00:55.200 --> 05:00:56.230 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist has an other
sessions

05:00:56.230 --> 05:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
like they just had last evening and
 
05:00:57.840 --> 05:00:58.868 align:start position:0%
like they just had last evening and
everything

05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:01:01.110 --> 05:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
so but this information is already
 
05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
available to

05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
already available it's not always easy
 
05:01:52.638 --> 05:01:53.510 align:start position:0%
already available it's not always easy
to

05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:53.520 --> 05:01:55.030 align:start position:0%
to

05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
acquire
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
there are some towns that give you a lot
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
harder time getting that list than other
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
towns we have actually had a
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative during the um during the
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
course of our trying to do
 
05:02:08.320 --> 05:02:10.230 align:start position:0%
course of our trying to do
uh

05:02:10.230 --> 05:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
our own little kind of voter integrity
 
05:02:13.120 --> 05:02:14.628 align:start position:0%
our own little kind of voter integrity
process

05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
actually get arrested
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
for trying to obtain this information so
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is a problem for the citizens of new
 
05:02:23.360 --> 05:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
it is a problem for the citizens of new
hampshire

05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
it's a shame that we've gotten to the
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
point that our elections are such in
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
for me they've been in question since
 
05:02:34.320 --> 05:02:36.310 align:start position:0%
for me they've been in question since
2002.

05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
2002.
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh i've been i've been concerned about
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
the integrity of our election since 2002
 
05:02:45.430 --> 05:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
and it has been falling on deaf ears for
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
many years so i am very
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
very thankful that a lot of this has
 
05:02:52.550 --> 05:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
come to light but i think it's important
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
that we all recognize we have an
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity right now we have an
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be transparent for the
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
people that put us in the positions that
 
05:03:04.230 --> 05:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
you folks are in we have a opportunity
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
to be to
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
although it may cost a property owner
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
one more dollar a month in property
 
05:03:16.550 --> 05:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
taxes it'll be saving them thousands in
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
potential in potential legislation
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's actually
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
not advantageous to them
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
with regards to the fee that's involved
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
right now the parties the democratic
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
party and the republican party pay a fee
 
05:03:34.310 --> 05:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
for this information and it's given back
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities shame on us
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
if that's the reason for opposing this
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
shame on us
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
it should not be about that the bottom
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
line is is that the people of the state
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire do not believe in our
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
in in our voting process
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not they don't believe in
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
the voting process they don't believe in
 
05:04:03.270 --> 05:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the the voting registry they don't
 
05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the checklists are being
 
05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately managed the bottom line is
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
is that we have a responsibility
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
to to the people of new hampshire to be
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
able to say
 
05:04:14.320 --> 05:04:16.230 align:start position:0%
able to say
okay

05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:18.150 --> 05:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
we are going to be completely
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
transparent we're going to allow you at
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
no cost to do on your own time and on at
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
your own
 
05:04:27.680 --> 05:04:29.110 align:start position:0%
your own
expense

05:04:29.110 --> 05:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
expense
 
05:04:29.120 --> 05:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
expense
for

05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
generating all these and canvassing and
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
things like that we're going to allow
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
you to prove that voting in new
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire is either good or bad and
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
we're allowing you to be part of the
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
process to fix with the problems where
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
they exist
 
05:04:46.470 --> 05:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i like about this
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet being available is that
 
05:04:53.590 --> 05:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it actually decreases
 
05:04:56.310 --> 05:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
nefarious uh potential nefarious
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
problems with uh selling of data um
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
selling of data is a real thing whether
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
you get the the registries going from
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
town to town or you get them on a
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet if i log in electronically
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i pull down
 
05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
all these people
 
05:05:19.830 --> 05:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
then there's a there's an ip address
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
connected to me and if i'm doing
 
05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
something that i should not be doing
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to be easier for for the
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
powers that be to come to me and say
 
05:05:30.718 --> 05:05:31.590 align:start position:0%
powers that be to come to me and say
uh

05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
whereas right now
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have to show any kind of proof
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
of who you are you can walk into a town
 
05:05:39.510 --> 05:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
hall like i said some are better than
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
others but some town halls you can walk
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
in and say i would like this and they
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
say okay give us 20 minutes
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
and then you walk out with it you never
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
show an id you you never have to explain
 
05:05:54.070 --> 05:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
why you wanted this information
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so i i uh support this bill for
 
05:06:00.150 --> 05:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
exactly i think that this bill does a
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
good job trying to
 
05:06:02.080 --> 05:06:03.670 align:start position:0%
good job trying to
um

05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
further support the integrity of our of
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
our right right to vote in this state
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
05:06:17.590 --> 05:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
the last person i have signed up for
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:06:29.440 --> 05:06:30.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i would like to say that the thing
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
that president ronald reagan said trust
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
but verified
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
the second thing follow up on that is
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
stalin the communist leader he said that
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how many people vote
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
it matters who count the vote
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i've been following this since
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
november 2020 because i have no faith in
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
our election process
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
no election integrity i don't have faith
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
i still go through the motion of voting
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
but i don't trust it i need to verify it
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
and this bill um hb 1496
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
helped us me
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
to verify those facts myself
 
05:07:13.840 --> 05:07:15.110 align:start position:0%
to verify those facts myself
and

05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
the honorable curt earlier is mentioned
 
05:07:16.878 --> 05:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
the honorable curt earlier is mentioned
about

05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
the cost i mean the revenue lost by the
 
05:07:20.400 --> 05:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
the cost i mean the revenue lost by the
town

05:07:21.430 --> 05:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
the first nation first in the nation
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
status of new hampshire earns new
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire business two billion dollars
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars
 
05:07:33.510 --> 05:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we worry about the one dollar
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
something in the town for the cost
 
05:07:38.948 --> 05:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
we need to prove this first in the
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
nation process is that we have the right

05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
birthday and i go on the website check
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
it for him
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
he has been registered to vote as a
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
republican forever and in fact he
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't even know how to change it yet
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
on the website it shows that he's
 
05:08:46.080 --> 05:08:47.350 align:start position:0%
on the website it shows that he's
independent

05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
he's like what's independent
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
who changed that information for him
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
so i called the town
 
05:08:57.030 --> 05:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
manchester and he said well you have to
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
come down and fill out the form you know
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
to change that back to republicans so i
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
met him there and helped him do that and
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
i asked them again
 
05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
who changed that information
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
they couldn't answer that
 
05:09:10.160 --> 05:09:10.868 align:start position:0%
they couldn't answer that
so

05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
with this list available to us easily so
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we can just go through it and check
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
it just but verified
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
without this information available i
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
would not know
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
until like people like that call and let
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
me know or they don't even know that
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
themselves and i help people register to
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%

05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%

us
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
the peasants who supposed to be
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
the owner of this country
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
to get through the red tip because i'm
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
sick of that
 
05:10:00.320 --> 05:10:01.270 align:start position:0%
sick of that
the

05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
political party had the power to do this
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that but we the little people are
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
that paying all the taxes
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
don't have that right
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
that is not right if we're talking about
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
all means are created equal our rights
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
are equal why are these political party
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
people have more power than we do
 
05:10:26.310 --> 05:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
we should have the same right
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
access to the information so that we can
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
check and verify make sure it's a
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
transparent process so we can restore
 
05:10:36.788 --> 05:10:36.798 align:start position:0%

that's a nice change of pace for the day
 
05:11:53.680 --> 05:11:54.628 align:start position:0%
that's a nice change of pace for the day
um

05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is a follow-up bill to um
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that we passed last year
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
for those who remember we
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
made the electronic
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
copies of absentee ballot requests
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
available to candidates whose name
 
05:12:13.430 --> 05:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
appear on the ballot
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
that obviously had a bunch of moving
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
pieces in it if you recall from the
 
05:12:18.000 --> 05:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
pieces in it if you recall from the
hearing

05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:12:21.510 --> 05:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is brought in to address some
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
of those issues i will be bringing an
 
05:12:25.750 --> 05:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
amendment forward to this bill i'm
 
05:12:27.830 --> 05:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
currently communicating with my city
 
05:12:27.840 --> 05:12:28.948 align:start position:0%
currently communicating with my city
clerk

05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
who did do this in manchester
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
the bill the law went into effect before
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
the general election so i've been
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
talking with him about um
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
ways that we can improve it to kind of
 
05:12:42.788 --> 05:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
lighten the the burden on the town and
 
05:12:46.230 --> 05:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
city clerks um but also maintain
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation that we
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
passed um the
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as it is currently written
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
deals with the frequency in which the
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the list is made available ironically
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
enough my city clerk said ross isn't
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
daily a lot and i was like well you're
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
sending them out every day
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
so i may actually address the underlying
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill itself just to
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate the people that i represent
 
05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
but that is the intention of this
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is to address issues with um
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
within within the laws we passed that we
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
we knew and i said in the hearing we
 
05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
were going to find those and fix those
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
and get those tightened up before 2022.
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions for representative barry
 
05:13:27.430 --> 05:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
05:13:27.440 --> 05:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
representative lane
um

05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and representative
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm looking at the wrong bill so
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
but how does this make it
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not sure how having them
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
send it out within one business day
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
improves anything if not making it
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
harder and i'll follow up so go ahead
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
oh sorry uh how's um so the reason the
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
reason we want these lists um is
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
they are
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
when the when they send the ballot out
 
05:14:00.070 --> 05:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
right um the the clock is then ticking
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
to if you're gonna have a conversation
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
with that voter say hey go vote for me
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the clock is ticking right and and
 
05:14:07.270 --> 05:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
everybody in this committee we're all
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
election law nerds we know that a voter
 
05:14:10.550 --> 05:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
who submits an absolute ballot can show
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
up on election day at the polling
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
location two hours at two hours after
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
the polls have closed has opened and
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
request a new ballot and vote but the
 
05:14:19.750 --> 05:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
reality is is i'm not aware of a single
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
voter who has executed that i'm sure
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
somebody will have some anecdotal
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
evidence somewhere but we know that the
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
average voter doesn't understand that's
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
an option um
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
and elections you know once that ballot
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
is casts um you know it's over it's
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
effectively over it it is effectively
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
over so
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
when they're sending those out you know
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
i i do have the data from manchester and
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
i haven't had a chance to analyze um how
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
quickly the average voter is returning
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
it um but i do know just this is just
 
05:14:49.270 --> 05:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
kind of me scanning the data from
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
manchester's 2021 municipal election so
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not holding this up as some massive
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
study um but it was a pretty quick
 
05:14:59.350 --> 05:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
turnaround time i think it was less than
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
about three or four days with the
 
05:15:03.270 --> 05:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
average like it would after the day
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
after three or four days after it was
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
sent because and manchester is kind of
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
unique because if you get the mail to
 
05:15:09.430 --> 05:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
manchester at golf sals road it is
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
delivered in manchester the next day uh
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
so admittedly there's probably already
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
on an abbreviated window but you could
 
05:15:18.310 --> 05:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
see that's the point of the addressing
 
05:15:21.030 --> 05:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
the frequency is when the senate amended
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed they tacked it
 
05:15:27.030 --> 05:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
in with 91a provisions
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
which do have
 
05:15:31.990 --> 05:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
the five day windows to respond
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
thankfully my city clerk did not
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
attempt to use that but you could see
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
why that could be a problem if you know
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
if i submit a request to get the
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot list and then the city
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
clerk says hey i'll shoot it to you on
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
friday well if he's been mailing monday
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
tuesday wednesday thursday
 
05:15:49.110 --> 05:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
i don't get it until friday that's a
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
problem so i am going to address the
 
05:15:50.878 --> 05:15:52.070 align:start position:0%
problem so i am going to address the
frequency

05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
05:15:54.550 --> 05:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i will go to daily
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
but i will probably keep it within two
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
days just because of what i was seeing
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the manchester um elections
 
05:16:03.430 --> 05:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing we'll i'll attempt to
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
address will be
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
the data that was provided i believe
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
they were getting
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
lists sent to them from the secretary of
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
state's office at least this is what the
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
city clerk was conveying to me so they
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
weren't actually able to pull it
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
themselves they were getting the sos
 
05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
office was sending it i believe they
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
were getting it every
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
i believe it was every tuesday and
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
thursday it was either monday wednesday
 
05:16:23.110 --> 05:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
friday or tuesday and thursday i want to
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
say it was tuesday and thursday
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
and the data that was being provided was
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
incomplete and insufficient for the
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
average candidate to use i happened to
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
be smart on the average bear with
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
databases and i was able they were
 
05:16:40.230 --> 05:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
sending the state voter id number and
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
they were sending the the other kind of
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
pertinent information relative to an
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
absolute ballot request so date
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
requested date mail and date returned
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
are the three other pertinent pieces of
 
05:16:48.718 --> 05:16:49.750 align:start position:0%
are the three other pertinent pieces of
information

05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
so they were sending that so i had to
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
create a database using the state file
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
the the voter file
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
not to reopen that what we just went
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
through but i had to use the database
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
and use the the state voter id number to
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
cross-reference to that database to
 
05:17:06.070 --> 05:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
generate who the voter was with their
 
05:17:07.910 --> 05:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
relative information
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
it does create some problems because
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:17:11.200 --> 05:17:12.788 align:start position:0%
there are
um

05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:12.798 --> 05:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
the databases that's available to the
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
political parties are snapshots in time
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
right so somebody registers after it
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
obviously they don't have that in the
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
database so we did have about in my
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience about five percent of the
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that were being
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
requested we had no state voter id
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
number for them because we didn't
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're not legitimate
 
05:17:30.550 --> 05:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're not real voters
 
05:17:32.470 --> 05:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
just means we didn't have them um so i'm
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to try to address those issues as
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
well but it's going to be it's going to
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
be entirely a housekeeping bill to
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
tighten that and i said that when we
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
when i did the first time that we were
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to address things that we
 
05:17:44.788 --> 05:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
didn't afford that we didn't see but
 
05:17:46.470 --> 05:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen them and i'm trying to fix
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
them that was a really long answer to
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
your question i'm sorry yeah
 
05:17:50.958 --> 05:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
your question i'm sorry yeah
follow-up

05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
did i announce that i managed to get
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
around i'm not quite sure but give it a
 
05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
shot okay so
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
not every town clerk well i guess most
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
city clerks are open every day but not
 
05:18:04.550 --> 05:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
every town clerk's office is open every
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
day so
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know that they can comply with
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
this oh yeah no no so
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
i am going to fix it um but if the
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
original the original the the rsa that
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
we're editing
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
um because we we addressed this in the
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
hearing last time um it deals with days
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
that they're open so i i will write it
 
05:18:23.830 --> 05:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
around there because i i am aware that
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
some are only open you know some of them
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
are open one full day and a half day um
 
05:18:29.350 --> 05:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
right so i i will be addressing that yes
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
it it will not it's we we wrote it
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
originally around the days they were
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
open and this will be around the days
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
they were open okay so it's going to be
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
different than what we have now is that
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yes it will be
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
different than what we have now um you
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
know the i could only do so much when
 
05:18:47.590 --> 05:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
when filing because when the bill filing
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
was due we hadn't actually conducted the
 
05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
election so um i was just trying to
 
05:18:53.590 --> 05:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
address issues that i knew of at the
 
05:18:53.600 --> 05:18:54.550 align:start position:0%
address issues that i knew of at the
time

05:18:54.550 --> 05:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
but obviously now consulting with my
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
city clerk
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
other issues have arisen that he would
 
05:19:01.110 --> 05:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
like corrected and and i don't i said
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
when we pass this i don't i'm not trying

05:19:38.070 --> 05:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about what the bill
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
is proposing to do
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
a voter i mean the observer for the
 
05:19:59.430 --> 05:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
danville special elections a few months
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
ago and i was standing there
 
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
looking at them checking the s t ballots
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
and i checked
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
and they have miscount and
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
before that i was asked to stand like so
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
far away i could not hear anything i
 
05:20:16.390 --> 05:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
could not see anything so i had to
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
request to stand close so that's why i
 
05:20:19.040 --> 05:20:19.910 align:start position:0%
request to stand close so that's why i
found

05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
found
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
they count incorrectly
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
so i brought it up to the moderator and
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
so he fixed that so it's helpful for us
 
05:20:30.628 --> 05:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:20:33.430 --> 05:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
this uh absentee list
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that we know
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
roughly how many when we do the
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
observing on the election day
 
05:20:39.600 --> 05:20:40.470 align:start position:0%
observing on the election day
and

05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:40.480 --> 05:20:42.230 align:start position:0%
and
also

05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
i receive absentee ballot at my home for
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.520 --> 05:20:50.788 align:start position:0%
 
why

05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
how many times and many people that i
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
know have the same problem
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
and also many times i know that they
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
don't check compare the signature
 
05:21:02.230 --> 05:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
on the list
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i know people that show up to vote
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
and they say
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
you already voted absentee so you cannot
 
05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
vote again
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i cannot be there to help them
 
05:21:12.000 --> 05:21:13.270 align:start position:0%
and i cannot be there to help them
so

05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:15.670 --> 05:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
this absentee ballot business is
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
important because i did not ask for
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
those absentee ballots and i my
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
understanding is before this covet
 
05:21:22.958 --> 05:21:23.830 align:start position:0%
understanding is before this covet
thing

05:21:23.830 --> 05:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
is is you have to have the right process
 
05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
to get them now they mess mailing it out
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
to everybody
 
05:21:32.830 --> 05:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
that is wrong and they don't check the
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
signature so
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.480 --> 05:21:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
1383

05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
1383
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you does anybody have
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%

05:22:13.830 --> 05:22:13.840 align:start position:0%

you know i just received a lot of them
 
05:22:18.548 --> 05:22:18.558 align:start position:0%

05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballots so you know people
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
requesting absentee ballot they just
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
mail it to you whether or not you use it
 
05:22:33.190 --> 05:22:33.200 align:start position:0%

05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%

05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
all right also signed up to speak for
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:52.310 --> 05:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
05:22:52.320 --> 05:22:53.190 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
committee

05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to provide a little bit
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
under normal conditions i think that we
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
could supply
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.480 --> 05:23:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
suggests

05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
05:23:08.000 --> 05:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
suggests
however

05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
we have a situation with our database
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
where we had a vendor
 
05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:23:17.830 --> 05:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
that created it and maintained the
 
05:23:17.840 --> 05:23:18.868 align:start position:0%
that created it and maintained the
system

05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:23:20.708 --> 05:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
things worked incredibly well they did a
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
fantastic job
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
clerks were able to generate reports
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
that they needed along these lines and
 
05:23:27.990 --> 05:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the past we had suggested that they
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
make these
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
reports for absentee voters available
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
once or twice a week
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
on a very regular basis
 
05:23:36.240 --> 05:23:37.750 align:start position:0%
on a very regular basis
unfortunately

05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
that company sold to another company
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
who then assumed the intellectual
 
05:23:44.230 --> 05:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
05:23:44.240 --> 05:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
property rights
and

05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
that company has been doing an abysmal
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
job at maintaining
 
05:23:51.510 --> 05:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
the software system to the point that
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
things that have been working just great
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
are not working properly now
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's forcing our staff up at the hava
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
office to
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
work on generating their own reports
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
which is resulting in the issues that
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
you see in man in manchester
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get things
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
timely so
 
05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
we are trying to be as proactive as we
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
can with a situation we have drafted
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
an rfp a request for proposals
 
05:24:17.440 --> 05:24:18.548 align:start position:0%
an rfp a request for proposals
for

05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
upgrading our
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
election net system so we can get out
 
05:24:23.910 --> 05:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
from under the vendor that we currently
 
05:24:23.920 --> 05:24:24.948 align:start position:0%
from under the vendor that we currently
have

05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's going to take a
 
05:24:28.390 --> 05:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
little time and i'm not optimistic that
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this ready for
 
05:24:32.070 --> 05:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
the 22
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
2022 elections
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
certainly 2024 um
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
you know we expect that this will be
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
going smoothly but i just wanted to make
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
the committee aware
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
of that situation because it does impact
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know how you might address this
 
05:24:47.360 --> 05:24:48.628 align:start position:0%
you know how you might address this
legislation

05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:24:52.310 --> 05:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%

05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if this
 
05:25:01.990 --> 05:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass the house and pass the
 
05:25:03.190 --> 05:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
senate and
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
be enacted in 60 days
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
the governor is signing it
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
how would you deal with that
 
05:25:09.520 --> 05:25:10.470 align:start position:0%
how would you deal with that
well

05:25:10.470 --> 05:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
obviously we would deal with it
 
05:25:14.708 --> 05:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
with the language in this and i'm
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
anxious to see the amendment
 
05:25:17.910 --> 05:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they can have some input
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
but in this
 
05:25:22.310 --> 05:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
in this bill it says um
 
05:25:22.320 --> 05:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
in this bill it says um
uh

05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know should be provided
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding rsa 91a4 such copy shall
 
05:25:30.230 --> 05:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
provide it within one business day of
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
the request
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
it it implies that it's
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
you know i would read this as being the
 
05:25:37.990 --> 05:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
most recent
 
05:25:39.990 --> 05:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
copy of the list that's available
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
even if it's three or four days old
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
so you know if
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
if the request is made in and produced
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
in 24 hours it might be the same list
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
that you know the same person requested
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
three days ago
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
obviously we understand the need for
 
05:25:55.680 --> 05:25:56.548 align:start position:0%
obviously we understand the need for
this

05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
and you know we want to make sure that
 
05:26:00.548 --> 05:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
the lists are up to date and that
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
candidates especially get
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:26:05.830 --> 05:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
up-to-date accurate information on
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
absentee voters so that they can
 
05:26:10.548 --> 05:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
run their campaigns
 
05:26:10.558 --> 05:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
run their campaigns
but

05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
under the current condition producing a
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
list within 24 hours
 
05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
is unrealistic
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative so under the
 
05:26:19.920 --> 05:26:20.948 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative so under the
current

05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
climate with the current vendor how long
 
05:26:26.948 --> 05:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
would you expect it to take
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
if not in one day do you have an idea
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
roughly trisha how long do you think it
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.200 --> 05:26:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:26:39.670 --> 05:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
yeah but if
 
05:26:45.510 --> 05:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
if we if we had in place a system forget
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.590 --> 05:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
keep them up to date within two or three
 
05:26:57.600 --> 05:27:04.150 align:start position:0%
keep them up to date within two or three
days

05:27:04.150 --> 05:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
tuesdays and fridays
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
and fridays tuesday and friday okay
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
no go ahead
 
05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
thank you my question my question was
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
answered there because in the the
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
primary in 2020 i was doing things like
 
05:27:22.230 --> 05:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
writing to voters that requested ballots
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
the lists were kind of older so i i
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
guess like the turnaround time i think
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
you answered it was like three days or
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:31.440 --> 05:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
