related their to and I will recognize uh
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the House
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee I
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
am representative Erica Leon
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham district 6 Dair
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
and I am the prime sponsor of this film
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
for years I've wondered why dog licenses
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
are only offered for one year when the
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
most common rabes vaccine lasts three
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
years I spoke with my town clerk about
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
this issue and he agreed that allowing
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
the license to last as long is the
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
current vaccination would decrease his
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
burden in chasing down dog owners with
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
laps licenses while making life easier
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
for residents HB 585 allows a dog owner
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
to choose to register their dog for
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
either one year as provided for
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
currently or for a period of three years
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
the intent was to allow the license to
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
last as long as the current baby's
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination and the bill is silent on
 
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 align:start position:0%
the details of implementation on the
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
part of towns due to my conversations
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
with town clerk Dan Healey and his
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
discussions with other Town clerks
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of the current law is not
 
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
standard across towns so detailing how
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
towns would deal with this seemed overly
 
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
burdensome one of the big questions from
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
town clerks is how they would provide
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
for refunds this bill makes no
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions for refunds and leaves the
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
current one-year license in place as an
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
option for people with elderly
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
dogs might otherwise seek a refund the
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
other major part of this bill is a
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
reduction in fines associated with laps
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
dog licenses the current fines are
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
significant when compared to current dog
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
license fees a spade or neutered dog
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
cost $7.50 each year to to register and
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
the current forfeiture fee which is
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
assessed 20 days after fines begin start
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
at $25 which is over three times the
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
annual licensing fee for seniors who we
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
respect with a $3 annual dog licensing
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
fee this for forfeiture f is over eight
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
times their annual licensing fee the
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in fee to $10 still provides
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
teeth but it reduces the bite for dog
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
owners who may be facing Financial
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
hardships right now the requirement to
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
pay the dog license between January 1
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
and May 1st adds a third visit to town
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
hall to my annual schedule I pay it
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
can't pay it in December when I pay my
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
car in one of our property tax bills and
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
if I wait to pay it in July when I paid
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
for my husband's car registration and
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
our other property tax bill then it's
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
late and I have the $25 fine I know that
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge burden but our town
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
clerk sees lots and lots of frustrated
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
dog owners who were in and it would make
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
life easier for him and there would be a
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
lot fewer grumpy people in town hall and
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
I say that would be a win for
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
everybody so this dog would keep this
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill would keep dogs registered with
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
current vaccinations which is the
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
intention of dog licensing I realized
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
that I overlooked a few points when I
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
drafted this bill with the Hope help of
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
os I'm happy to put in an amendment to
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
go to finance that addresses the issues
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
like one of the sources of fees um if
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would help you and I'm happy to
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
take questions that you do have I do
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
have a exact session on hb20 so
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can be pry prompt with the
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
answers thank you thank you
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative so I uh presented this
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
bill language to My Town Clerk and just
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
put it through to see some questions
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
that she had and she gave me a few and I
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
certainly won't dominate a lot of the
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
time but there was a couple of prominent
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
ones that you might like to speak to so
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
H what about a a puppy with only a
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
one-year rabies booster how how would
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
that be addressed um a puppy with only
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
one-year radies booster should be
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
registered with only the one-ear vaccin
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
only the one-year license because the
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
intent was that the duration would
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
correspond with the r
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination and one other question that
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
I thought was notable is uh what if the
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
person has multiple dogs with multiples
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
rabies expiration dates how would that
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
be handled um with that I know that that
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't really help their burden um so
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
maybe a one-year license for them still
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense if they're having to come in
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
if the dogs aren't on a consistent
 
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.069 align:start position:0%
if the dogs aren't on a consistent
schedule

00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative Balden uh thank
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
you might have mentioned this in your
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
testimony but I might have missed it
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
what is what would be the cost for
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
three-year um bulk license basically uh
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
representative for your question the
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
cost should be three times the annual
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
license because you were simply
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
prepaying for those additional three
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
years as opposed to getting any sort of
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
discount most of those fees do go to
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of different services and
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
I think that it would be inappropriate
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
to Short change those Departments of the
 
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
revenue that they count on from those
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
licenses okay follow followup um thank
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my followup what I'm do
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
you know what the number would be I I'm
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
not 100% clear on what the existing
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
number is so I don't know what to
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
multiply by three to get that number oh
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry about that the for a spater
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
neuter dog and I believe a puppy as well
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
um who's below the age Bay a Neu in it's
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
$7.50 a year so that would be 2250 for a
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
three-year license for um intact dogs
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's $10 so that would be $30 for the
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
license and for senior citizens there
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
have a $3 license fee that would be $9
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
okay and just one more one more follow
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
all right um thanks my final followup um
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I assume um that the the
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
fine being lowered to $10 that that
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
would be that would be $10 for failing
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
to register that for that three-year
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
license um if if registering or getting
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
the license would cost $22 but the
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
Fine's only $10 doesn't that give a
 
00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:11.959 align:start position:0%
financial incentive to not actually get
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
the dog
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
registered um thank you for your
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
question representative if you have
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not looking to register
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
their dog there's already people who
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't register their their dogs right
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
now keeping that intact respect those
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
those residents who are on a more fixed
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
income who may be the ones more likely
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
to register each year and then possibly
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
r a follow of those fines if this is
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
something where our town clerk does not
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
rely on those fines it's more of a
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
hassle for him to have to chase these
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
people down and for most people that
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a significant difference
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
between t $10 and $25 but for the less
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
financially secure residents of our
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
state it is a big difference and I think
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
that we should respect them in that
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
decision thank you thank you thank you
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking uh my question
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon I have a couple
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
of questions um the way I read this bill
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
initially uh is that the fees to the
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
neutering program decrease startup costs
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
increase tag inventory cost
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
increase fees decrease so the money
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
going uh to the state lab and other
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
programs to support um uh animal
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
Licensing in the state looks like it's
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
going to be decreased uh secondly I
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
thought t uh several Town clerks also
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
depended uh on their income you know
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
from uh dog licensing fees so I was
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
wondering why that was SE to be such a
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
large part of the
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
representative for the question as I was
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
researching this and working with OS it
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
was completely overlooked that the
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
department vet AR diagnostic laboratory
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
gets money from the licenses this is one
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the areas that I would be glad to
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment for the committee
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful I know with our
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
time frame that may be better dealt with
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
in finance if you choose to move this
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill forward um but I would like to do
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
whatever I can to remedy that
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
situation as far as the as the
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
costs I right now the only thing that
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
would be reduced would be the fines for
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
people who don't pay and now there is a
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
provision for uh a cost in order to
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
track these track that these people down
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
I I question the business or the model
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
of relying on fines from residents who
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
do not comply um that are punitive fines
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
as a way of funding an apartment this is
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%
it just incentivizes people to break the
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
law and to not respect the laws and I
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
think I I'm concerned if that is an
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
important budget item in any town
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
and um that that's just that's just sort
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
of a philosophical issue for me you
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be relying on fines um did I
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
get both all of your questions
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative yes uh thank you I
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you all right
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative hola thank
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
you chair and thank you representative
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
for um taking my questions in and
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
introducing this actually I think it's
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
very practical the one question I did
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
have was sort of on the reverse of the
 
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
previous question are there any costs
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
that are baked in right now to that $7
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
50 that represents just the the time
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
that the clerk has to handle it and if
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
we if we don't require the clerk then to
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
be handling these every three years even
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
if it's a dollar wouldn't that sort of
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that sort of um sort of paying
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk for something that you're not
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
doing every year now so is there any
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
thought to that or do you have any
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
figures on what that dollar amount is
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
that is just sort of the clerk handling
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
fee uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative um as I had added these
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
up before I thought that there were
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
several dollars going to the clerks but
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
I had missed $2 that goes to the
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
veterinary lab so the amount that they
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
get is quite small and actually would
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
subsidize any senior dog senior dog
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
owners because they they pay $3 which is
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
less than the fees that go to other
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
departments okay there may be a
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
difference in handling costs but when I
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
spoke with my town clerk who is involved
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
in the town clerks Association some
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
towns may not want to get three
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
different license tags and it may be
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
easier for them to just annually send
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
those out when they come around check a
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that says that they're
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
already paid up for the three years and
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
because if they do handle it on a more
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
manual basis with the same one-ear tabs
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't reduce the burden at all
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
for the clerks so I see that because
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're silent on implementation it makes
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
sense to keep those levels intact thank
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
you thanks thank
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
you all right uh I will recognize
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
representative Highland
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
question um I was just going to go back
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
to the hassle um that you had mentioned
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
about um you know coming in to do all
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
these different payments and having to
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
think about the licensing um at a
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
different time um in our town here in
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
Francis town all of this can be done
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
online I was curious if that is the same
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
for your town and if it's the same
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
across the board and if that should be
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
considered um that all these at least
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
the renewal can be done online I'm not
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
sure about the original the initial
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
licensing I'm just curious about that
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
you representative we are able to pay
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
this online but when we do that there's
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
a $1.75 credit card fee to do that
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
online and for $7.50 registration as an
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
economist I just I just can't click that
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
box that enables the $175 I know that I
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
also could write a check and drop that
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
in the mail with the 50 Cent um stamp
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
but when it comes down to it this would
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of grumpy people in
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
town just because they're able to get in
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
there it would just make everybody's
 
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
life easier and as we've seen with um
 
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:10.039 align:start position:0%
with social distancing and all of this
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
with covid it's kind of nice to be able
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce the foot traffic because that
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
that does improve the quality of service
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
and just the the environment at the Our
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
question all right I will recognize
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um do
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
you uh happen to have any idea how
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
frequently um fines are issued in order
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
to enforce uh uh the licensing
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions um thank you Mr chair and
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative right now in
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
Dair I believe they have close to a 100
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
that they issue but a lot of times they
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
wave them if people come back right away
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
because it makes for Less contention at
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
Town Hall so there are sending out these
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
checks people come bustling in and say
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry I forgot to pay for my dog
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
license and they're good people and they
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
often wave those fines but it just
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
becomes more of an issue for people
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
there's others that obviously come in
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
with a demanding attitude and they're
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
probably a lot less likely to have those
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
fines waved but it's I guess the
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
question is are you looking to see
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is actually a
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
problem or if it would hurt the income
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
towns right I was just getting wanted to
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
get a sense of the the scale of the
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
problem thank you I I don't know the
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
exact scale but I do know that they send
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
out a significant number of D okay thank
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
you all right uh I'll recognize
 
00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:42.950 align:start position:0%
you all right uh I'll recognize
representative

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.909 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
much question is I know in my town um
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
each year when we our dog she gets a
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
different colored
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
T so you know you know how they would be
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
able to manage have a
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
threee you know it seems like it would
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
be so complicated
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
Forks to
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
manage different
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
scenarios uh thank you Mr Shar and thank
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
you representative for your question I
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
also wondered how best to implement the
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
tags because they do change here year
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
and this is something that I took to my
 
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
town clerk Dan Healey and he took to the
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
cap Town clerks Association um they were
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
split between Town clerks would rather
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
just annually send out that same tag
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
while uh my clerk would actually with
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
the size of dairy would go ahead and
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
order those three years just like they
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
do for license plate stickers so that
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
when it does come in they would have
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
that color and that correct tag that
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
goes for the entire duration of the
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
licensing uh town to Town the desired
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
implementation differed a lot which is
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
why we didn't put any mechanism into
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
this and it leaves it leaves that
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
CL I additionally um I don't see any
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism here for any kind of refunds
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
or you know say you get a threeyear
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
license for your uhy old dog and
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately within a year or two dog
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
dies so you're left with paying for
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
license for extra year two you
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
need or even if the animal is
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
transferred to somebody else it's a
 
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.070 align:start position:0%
transferred to somebody else it's a
younger

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
younger
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
animal how would that work there be any
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
position for refunds uh thank you for
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
your question that's another one that I
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
talked to with my clerk and he spoke to
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
the clerks
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
Association having a mechanism in place
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
for a refund would have made this very
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
very burdensome for the clerks and that
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons to leave it
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
optional right now my dog is five years
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
older than myself
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
13 they have the same birthday so I as
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
we've been wanting to do this we tried
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have this in as constituent Bill
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
years and years and years ago and now I
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
understand why it didn't go in it's more
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
complex than I realized but uh it's
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
something where you if they have the
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
option you may you would value the
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
convenience of only having to Reg
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
register every three years over the
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
potential of not getting a refund so
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
this is one of the many reasons to leave
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
the one-year license intact especially
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
for our less financially secure
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
residents those with older dogs those
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be May uh see a
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
shorter duration of ownership and it
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
seemed like the best compromise without
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
creating a need for an escrow fund or
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
anything else it would just be far too
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
all right representative Bixby did you
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
have another
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
question no sorry I just forgot to take
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
my hand down all right we'll forgive you
 
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
my hand down all right we'll forgive you
this

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
time U actually that transitions into
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
another question that my town clerk had
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'll jump in her question was
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh if if they are licensed for three
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
years and someone has a non non-altered
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
dog and they uh get it altered in that
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
three years would they be looking for a
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
refund so I guess you're sort of answer
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be similar to what
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
you just gave about the refund uh thank
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yes uh the answer would be
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
that there AR refunds so if you're
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
looking for your situation to change
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
within those three years it makes more
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
sense to get the onee license all right
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative before I let her go
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
representative comp yes thank you Mr
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
question um just in listening to all the
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions being asked um would this make
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
it more complicated for some of the Town
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
clerks having a oneyear license and a
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
threeyear license because it seems like
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
they would have you know they have to
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
keep track of different states where
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
right now it's every dog is licensed
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
every year on April 1 um is technically
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
the time frame now you're it's it's a
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
moving Target would that make it more
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
complicated for them uh thank you Mr
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your question
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative this this was another
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
concern that I had I know that in Dairy
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
they look they use more of a spreadsheet
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about software
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
but I that I wasn't aware that there was
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
any software in order to manage this
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
because this is done on a list based uh
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
system at least in deri and I would
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
assume in smaller towns they figured
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
that they would just add a couple
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
columns to it so that just as when
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in January 1 they're
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
marked off is paid and they otherwise
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
would have them as unpaid knowing who to
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
who to track down they would have that
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
information and just add a couple
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
columns to their spreadsheet to keep it
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
basis so there's one other question um I
 
00:25:07.389 --> 00:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
thought that the uh Department of a was
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to jump in and testify but I don't
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
have them on my list so I'm going to
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually ask it it was raised by Dr
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
Crawford about the fees going into the
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
spay and neutering fund uh have you
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
given any thought to how that would
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
impact the the state's Revenue because
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
they would all of a sudden be getting
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
three years worth of Revenue in one year
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
and perhaps not in the other years did
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
you have that conversation with the
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
department at all um thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
that is a wonderful question because
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
these are would be running concurrently
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the three years rabies vaccination
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
I don't have any reason to expect that
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
there's an unequal distribution of these
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so if in year one you have
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh just the dogs who are who have been
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
newly vaccinated would be eligible for
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
that three-year license so there would
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
be a small ballist at that point then at
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
year two the dogs who in that second
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
year came into their three-year baby
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
cycle would then be eligible for that
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
threeyear renewal and the same thing on
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
the third year so there'd be some Bas up
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
front but because you would be renewing
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
these dogs on that threeyear basis and
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
then the individual one-year renewals it
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
should actually just give a little bit
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
more money up front but continue with
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
those fees over on overall thank you I
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
do not see oh representative Aon one
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
me with that in and being on commit in
 
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.950 align:start position:0%
me with that in and being on commit in
my

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
town you know certainly that is a budget
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.590 align:start position:0%
 
thec

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
thec
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
and you think that that would also come
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
into play for being a very
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
volatile item to manage for a town
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
number still something the town clerks
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
on um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative for that insightful
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
question that is another one of these
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
areas where as you look to how much is
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
going out immediately to these different
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
programs the amount that stays on the
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
town is relatively small but it could be
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
a significant impact um I think that
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
that probably would require more study
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I apolog oliz that I didn't dig
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
better into this I had two bills that I
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
put in this year one was for improving
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
checklist maintenance and this bill is
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
actually far more complex than working
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
on our
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
elections because there's so many moving
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
pieces if there's still lingering
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions and this is something that you
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
want to retain and would like me to work
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
on over the interim I'd be happy to do
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
that because it is a complex topic that
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think would benefit our citizens and I
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
would like to see this happen and even
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't happen this year I would
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
like to see this as as an option well
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll certainly take that into
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
consideration not looking at the time I

yes I will do that as soon as I go back

to my computer my iPad wasn't
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
cooperating thank
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to ask the clerk to
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that uh representative Mason
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
us all right uh next we have Nancy
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
Holmes representing herself as a member
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
of the public Nancy are you able to
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
unmute and join us um yeah I think I'm
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
unmuted am I you are good go ahead Nancy
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
okay good to go okay um I I was
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
listening pretty carefully but I had a
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
cat inter eruption one of those problems
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
with uh working at home and I missed
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
where um anything was said about the
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
spay neuter fund getting its money the
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill as written does not allow for any
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
money going into the spay neuter fund
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
and I see that as a big issue um that
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
fund is uh put New Hampshire in a very
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
good place in terms of animal
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
overpopulation issues and our shelter
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
problems um and you know like I said
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
maybe I just just missed that um the
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
other thing that I I had a concern about
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
aside from the written testimony I sent
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
in was group licenses now for years I
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
bought a group license because I had a
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
number of dogs and it was a it was a
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
good savings for me to do that um how
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
would a three-year group license work if
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
it could um you know the um other people
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
touched on some of the other concerns I
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
had in terms of you know what if you
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
transfer a dog what if the dog passes
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
away um H but they didn't get down into
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
the the gritty details of it which is
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay if you do a refund then does the
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
state lab have to give money back does
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
the Spain neuter fund have to give money
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
back or is it only the town portion you
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
would get back um I I do see this as as
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
being I think more complex than was
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
thought I also can see how um the intent
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
was excellent in terms of making dog
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
licensing more convenient but let's say
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
you have three dogs and everybody's on a
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
different vaccination schedule for
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
licensing you're still going to be back
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
at Town Hall every year just to keep
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
track of who needs what because you
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
can't buy uh you wouldn't be buying a
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
three-year license for all three dogs at
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
the same time unless of course you were
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
buying a group license which I think is
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
for five or more dogs so those are some
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
of the questions I had and I I really
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
hope that um maybe some more thought can
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
be put into this bill because I think it
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
could work but not sure the consequences
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
are completely understood and the other
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
thing I have to say is about those
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
lovely rabies tags I have yet to have a
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
single rabies tag last more than four
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
months on a
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
dog I don't know what they do with them
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
um I found one stuffed down the heat
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
vent once um I found other people's
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
rabies tags along the dog walking trail
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
but um I I can't imagine that a a
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
three-year tag would ever be available
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the dog after the first a little bit
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
so um you know th those are my concerns
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
like I said I understand the intent was
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
nice but um I'm not sure the uh
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
practicality of it
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
is you'll be happy to answer any
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
questions if somebody had any questions
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
about my written verbal testimony all
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
Nancy do you see any
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
hands all right I think we're gonna let
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
you off easy Nancy thank you great
 
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.269 align:start position:0%
you off easy Nancy thank you great
thanks

00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
all right uh is there anyone else that
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
bill all right then I'm going to close
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
this bill for public testimony and
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
actually I think I'm going to go right
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
in and then think we're going to exec it
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
right now um and I'm going to look to uh
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative Arnold to make a motion
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I move
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
Bill all right representative Arnold has
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
moved to retain do we have a
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
second uh I will second that um I will
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
second that representative Bixby thank
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
you so we have a representative Hood
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
moves to retain and representative Bixby
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
has moved to Second do we have any
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee um yes Mr
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
chair I just uh I think that uh what we
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
um heard in the in testimony was that uh
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's a generally good idea
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
but um there are a lot of details that
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
still need to be worked out and um
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
working those out within our deadlines
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
and within our um with a limited scope
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
for doing extra meetings at this point
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
uh isn't makes it diff I don't think we
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
could get it out by uh crossover so um I
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
I think that it would make sense to
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
study it uh in the fall and then um um
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
bring back an amendment
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
version thank you representative I I
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
also would agree that while I certainly
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate and uh I like the concept I I
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
do believe there's a lot of details
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
especially related to the revenue to the
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
department and to the questions that the
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh Town clerks have raised that deserve
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
some uh time that we don't have to give
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
right now so I I would agree is there
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions disc
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none I'm
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
going to ask the clerk to call the role
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
so the the clerk is looking for a motion
 
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.069 align:start position:0%
so the the clerk is looking for a motion
to

00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
retain Mr chair yes uh could I just
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
request that uh people have their
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
cameras on for this yes they they need
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%

up the idea of putting oh never mind

representative from Carol County
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
District 2 I appear today to introduce
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
387 which I sponsored at the request of
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
a constituent I recognized that my
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
constituent had done a tremendous amount
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
of research and she had even written out
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
the language for the proposed bill so
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
therefore I felt obligated to sponsor
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
the bill for her I explained to her that
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
I know nothing about this issue and I
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
would not be able to testify in support
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill or to answer any questions
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
about the issue therefore I request that
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
you call on Maryanne omara to explain
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%

inflammation of the heart muscle and

chronic digestive issues these are just
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
a few of the known reactions in dogs to
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
the rabies vaccine the ones I have
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
personal experience with with time
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
finances and the right Veterinary
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
support some of these dogs lives can
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
improve giving them a chance at a
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
somewhat normal life until their next
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination in New Hampshire sure we are
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have the option to obtain
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
an exemption for these dogs however this
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
exemption comes with a price as the law
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
reads today K9 Sports daycare grooming
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
obedience classes and boarding kennels
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
are all out of the question for these
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
dogs as they shall be maintained in
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
strict rabies isolation muzzled on a
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
leash and under direct physical control
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
of an adult owner at all times when
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
outside as I did my research on how this
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
could be changed I was surprised at what
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
I found the current compendium States
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
within 28 days after initial vaccination
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
a peak rabies virus antibody tighter is
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
expected and the animal can be
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
considered immunized in all the years
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
that I have owned dogs I don't ever
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
recall this being suggested to me this
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
tells me that when done a titer is
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
accepted as proof of response it also
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
leads me to believe that there could be
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
any number of dogs who are
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
non-responders as babies is transmitted
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
through saliva I would be more concerned
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
about those dogs being out and about in
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
public my goal in taking on this project
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
was to remove the rabies isolation
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
stipulation for vaccinated dogs with
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions it was not my intent
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
nor is it my responsibility to put
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
owners of non-responders in that same
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
difficult position I respectfully
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
request that lines 7 through 16 be
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
modified to reflect that and would
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to provide input
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
the compendium also States under post
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
exposure management dogs and cats that
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
are overdue for a booster vaccination
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
and that have appropriate documentation
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
of having received a USDA licensed
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%

animal should be kept under the owner's
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
control and observed for 45 days again
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
we fortunate as the state of New
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not require immediate
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
euthanasia for these dogs if a dog is
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
considered immunized after initial
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination if nonresponders are not
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
identified if dogs with an out-of-date
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination are not required to be kept
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
in rabies isolation why is this imposed
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
on dogs with medical exemptions who must
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
have had at least one rabies vaccination
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
to have had a
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
reaction should I have an emergency that
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
would require boarding my dogs they
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
would need to have a rabies booster one
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
has congestive heart failure the other
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
chronic digestive issues and violent
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
itching both have documented reactions
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
to previous rabies boosters both have
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
tighter levels well above the minimal
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
requirement it is my job to keep my dog
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
safe from harm I'm trying to do that by
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
changing this law I did receive a couple
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
of email queries um and if I may I'd
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
like to address those now um one was
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
concerned about standardized titer
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
testing and the variations of results
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
from Lab to lab I'm familiar with only
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
two Labs that do rabes titers for
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
Animals Atlanta Health Associates and
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
Kansas State University I know that Dr
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
John Rob offers to have titers done
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
through KSU for a reasonable cost I
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
believe due to the number of samples he
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
submits the rfit test can be run as
 
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
modified or endpoint which is more
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
accurate more expensive but not
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily required a modified test
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
should be sufficient to determine that
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
there has been a response to the vaccine
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
if we are to require that titers be done
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
to validate a response it would make the
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
most sense to stick to one lab for all
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
samples given the quantity that would be
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
submitted there could possibly be a
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
financial advantage as for standard
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
results an article on the avma website
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarians includes the following the
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
acip recommends titer on a schedule of
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
every two years to assess protective

immunity with a single injection booster
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
vaccination recommended if the titer
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%

although the presence of antibodies
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%

against the disease in every individual
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
because there are other immunological
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
factors involved in the protection from
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%

01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
status that's that hopefully answers
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
that question um there were
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
another there were a lot of concerns um
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
about what I'm proposing
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and I think I've answered a number of
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
them um with my testimony and also that
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
response all right thank you Mr Mayor
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
why don't we open it up to some
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
questions from the members of the
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
committee representative bden uh thank
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and and thank you so much
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
for testifying today and for taking my
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
question um I noticed that the paragraph
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's being amended applies to dogs
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
cats and ferrets but the amendment or
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
the um the Bill only addresses that uh
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
that all this tighter testing would
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
apply to dogs is there a reason why cats
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
and ferrets are not included in this
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
bill well I have to say it's simply
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm a dog person and I don't
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
have enough information how it affects
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
ferrets thank
 
01:08:23.309 --> 01:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:25.950 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
committee

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.189 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
sfus thank you uh Mr chairman um this Dr
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
Rob that you talked about he um
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
he he testified before us the last time
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
this bill came up and he testified that
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
he had lost his his ability to give
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
rabies shots because he was not giving
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
the full dose and um I was wondering if
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
his if his privileges have been
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
restored I'm not sure about that I know
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot of
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
information and I you know I I read it
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
and I think about it I mentioned him
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
simply because he is offering this
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
service to P owners and you don't have
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be a client of his your own
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian can pull the blood have it
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
spun all Dr Rob is offering is that you
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
get it submitted through his account
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
which keeps the cost to a minimum for
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
pet owners because having titers done
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
can run into the high
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
numbers all
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
right any other questions from the
 
01:09:53.319 --> 01:10:01.790 align:start position:0%
right any other questions from the
committee

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
z uh represented boo you had your hand
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
up did you have a follow-up question or
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that you wanted to
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
offer uh no I did not uh no all right
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
did you have a yes thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
and so M thank you so much for coming
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
and testify today um I'm interested to
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
know more
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
about the exemption if if animal say we
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
did have some sort of way in which to
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
really determine accurately tighter
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
what what
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
how for any animal that did not where
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
that did uh have have a a tighter amount
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
and could be Exempted from getting a r
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
shot would you what would you recommend
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the current exemption the animal has
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be uh in isolation and under certain
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
how would you see that they would be
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
treated any differently than any other
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
animal I believe that a dog that has a
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
current medical exemption should be
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
treated the same as a dog with an out
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
ofd rabies
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination um which is exactly what I
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
referenced from the compendium they
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
don't need to be in isolation they
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
simply need to be boostered um I don't
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
understand why it's any different for a
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
dog who's had a reaction it seems a
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
severe for me to have to put my dog in
 
01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:07.070 align:start position:0%
severe for me to have to put my dog in
rabies

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
rabies
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
isolation excuse me when clearly they
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
have protection from rabies just by the
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
fact that I had their tighter done last
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
year and they were way above the
 
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.830 align:start position:0%
year and they were way above the
0.5

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
0.5
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
limit so I don't understand why they
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
need to be an i ol ation they've done
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong other than to have a
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
reaction to a very difficult
 
01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.430 align:start position:0%
reaction to a very difficult
vaccination

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
um they should just be allowed to be
 
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
dogs and I think you'll find that
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
anybody who's had a dog who's had a
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
severe reaction isn't going to be
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
letting their dogs out running free and
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
bothering other people most of those
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
dogs don't really want that kind of a
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
life after that that's providing they
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
can even recover from the reactions that
 
01:12:58.639 --> 01:13:00.750 align:start position:0%
can even recover from the reactions that
they've

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
they've
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
had I hope that helps thank you uh
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative Highland I'll recognize
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
you for a
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
question uh Mr chair I was just trying
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
to get up to speed a little bit on um is
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
this bill a preventative measure or is
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
this in response to an increase in
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
rabies in the community
 
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.790 align:start position:0%
rabies in the community
thank

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
you for me it's neither for me it's it's
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
having a dog who's had a severe reaction
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
spending hours lots of money lots of
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
worry helping that dog get back to
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat normal who now can never go
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere or do anything I can't take my
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
dog to a training class I can't really
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
go anywhere with my dog unless it's on a
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
six-foot lead or muzzled um I used to
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
compete in Dog Sports I used to love
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
taking my dogs to training classes just
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
for fun just for the social aspect of it
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
and yes I understand things have changed
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
that way right now but you know what's
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
to say that in the future I get another
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
dog who also ends up with a a reaction
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
to the rabies vaccine I choose to get a
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
waiver I now can no longer do anything
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
with my dog
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
lots of people get dogs to compete
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's what their hobby is Dog Sports
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
suddenly they're no longer allowed to do
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
that so it's simply to allow these dogs
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
the freedom that dogs with a lapsed
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine have there's really no
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
difference in in my
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
view thank you representative Kaplan did
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes I did thank you
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair for taking my question and uh
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr for coming in um I didn't
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
know that some dogs uh you know got
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
allergic reactions to the rabies vaccine
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
I suppose that's it's U uh you know not
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
that surprising because those things do
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
happen with vaccinations but I sounds
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
like it's more frequent than we than we
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
assumed but the way I'm reading your uh
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
your your bill as proposed it seems to
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
be mandating all dog owners to receive
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
this tighter test after getting the
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccination and it sounds fam
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony that that wasn't your
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
intent is that correct actually I would
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
love to see um dog owners have a tighter
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
done after the initial vaccination just
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there is protection there
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
and that is in the
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
compendium and I think that the way it's
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
written in the compendium is a bit
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
confusing because there's nothing else
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
in any of our laws that say that that
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
we'll accept titer but in that
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
particular section that's what it says
 
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
that you have to that unless somebody
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
knows some magical way to to tell that a
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
dog has received protection from that
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
first vaccination the only way to tell
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
is to do a Tighter and there are a
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
number of reasons why a dog wouldn't
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
respond to the vaccine
 
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
um followup question if I may Mr chair
 
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
um followup question if I may Mr chair
yes

01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
go you uh Mr Mayor do you know how
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
common it is for dogs not to respond to
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
to a vaccine I mean it seems like from
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
what I know of of most vaccines in
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
humans that's a pretty rare occurrence
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
so I mean is it is it more common than
 
01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:41.790 align:start position:0%
so I mean is it is it more common than
we

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
think I think it's a lot more common
 
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
than we think and I think one of the
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
biggest problems is
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
that the reactions are not recognized as
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
such for example
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
I have one dog who when she had her last
 
01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.709 align:start position:0%
I have one dog who when she had her last
rabies

01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
rabies
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
2008 within hours after returning home
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
she started frantically chewing on
 
01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
herself nothing nothing would help
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
so if I called my local vet they would
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
just probably put her on some sort of
 
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.870 align:start position:0%
just probably put her on some sort of
medication

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
medication
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
that may or may not help it's not fixing
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
it it's not taking that problem away
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
it's just a Band-Aid
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
so how many other dogs out there are
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
itching how many other dogs have
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
seizures that are like just out of the
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
blue for what most people say well just
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
for no reason I don't know what happened
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
he just had a seizure but you can
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
usually track a lot of those things back
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
to after the rabies
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
vaccination unfortunately it just
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be an issue
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
for most people um maybe it's only an
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
issue for me but I've seen it enough
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
times that I know it's a problem I used
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
to be an obedience trainer I used to be
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
a pet Behavior counselor the number of
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
dogs that I
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
saw with behavior issues that were just
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
clinical I'm gonna I'm gonna interrupt
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
keep you to the question because we have
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
several more hands up so our
 
01:18:32.679 --> 01:18:34.669 align:start position:0%
several more hands up so our
representative

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um just a
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
curiosity what is the cost of the
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
tighter test and um as
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
Klan mentioned before with the language
 
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill um talking about tighter
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
tests being more vastly used
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
mentioning that wanting them after a dog
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
gets the vaccine to know that they um
 
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.470 align:start position:0%
gets the vaccine to know that they um
are

01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
responding U what the cost would be and
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
then how much that would be to the
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
owners I'd see possibly unnecessary
 
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
costs if they've already paid for the
 
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine and then now you're asking for
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
them to do a tighter test on
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
that the cost is going to vary depending
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
on whoever your V Vetinarian is they're
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
going to charge you whatever they feel
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
they should be charging you um that's
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit that Dr Rob is offering pet
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
owners his charge for um having a
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
tighter sent to KSU is
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
$55 as opposed to a 100 plus that you
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
would pay if you went just through your
 
01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.910 align:start position:0%
would pay if you went just through your
local

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
vet all right thank you representative
 
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
vet all right thank you representative
Duty

01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
Duty
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a cat owner not a dog owner so
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
this um I apologize if this is naive but
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
if a uh dog cannot have a rabies uh shot
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
and gets Exempted does that mean uh what
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
does that mean in terms of their ability
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
to run in the yard if you have a closed
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
in yard uh do they still have to be on a
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
leash do they still have to be muzzled
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
or are they free to roam at that point
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
well the way the is written today
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
it I can interpret it as if my
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
dog has a waiver anytime I take it
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
outside it needs to be muzzled and on a
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
lead I'd like to think that it would be
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay to let my dog run in my fenced in
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
yard um but as far as walking my down my
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
road my sorry my dog down the road I
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
live in the middle of nowhere yet
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
technically my dog should still be mus
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
buled and on a 6 foot Le so it does
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
really restrict and it's anytime the dog
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
is outside which means if you take your
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
dog anywhere it has to be muzzled and on
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
a lead so there really is quite a bit of
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
loss of
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
Freedom all right thank you
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
Highland thank you Mr chair for taking
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
my question I just was wondering within
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
the research if there if you found
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
precedent for this in other states and
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
how they're handling if they are if
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
there's any other example of using the
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
antibod tests within 30 days elsewhere
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
that we might see um you know the system
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
how they're using it how they
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
implemented it um that's that type of
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
thing thank you unfortunately I don't
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
know of any I do know that the state of
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
Delaware just recently passed a bill
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
accepting titer as opposed to just
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination in Li of vaccination so
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
there is a precedent there um that's not
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting with this but um I
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't know of any other states that are
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
actively accepting titer just as proof
 
01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.990 align:start position:0%
actively accepting titer just as proof
of

01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
response thank you representative hola
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I did but it was
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay OB thank you all right uh
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative Murray is
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair for taking
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you also also for
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so one of the things
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing um some conversation around
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
an Avenue of of uh utilizing a
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh a a testing laboratory outside of the
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire but I'm curious
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
how many facilities with uh veterinarian
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
facilities within the state of New
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um do you have an idea of um
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
what Laboratories they may utilize in
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
tighter testing or would I I'm just you
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
keep referencing this Dr Rob and sending
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
the tests in that direction would a
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
licensed New Hampshire veterinarian in
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting they would then send
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
their samples to this doctor I'm a
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
little bit confused no if you were to go
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
through Dr Rob you would take your dog
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
to your own veterinarian ask them to
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
draw the blood and spin it and then you
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
would have already printed off and paid
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the test through Dr Rob's website
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
you only need to stick your paperwork
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the vial of serum into the mail and
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
send it off to Kansas State
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
University if you were to have the
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
tighter test done or done the do the
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
whole process through your own local
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian they would do the same
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
thing they would draw the blood spin it
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
and they would fill out the paperwork
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
they would send it to Kansas
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
State the the difference is the cost
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
that that's it followup if I may uh sure
 
01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
that that's it followup if I may uh sure
followup

01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um do you know if if
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
choosing one Avenue or the other
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
um would have any um responsibility
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
placed on the veterinarian if you chose
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
to send it through the license of
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
another doctor does that affect the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who is assessing your
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
animal do they have a burden of
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to then communicate and
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
any way with the other
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
person um Dr
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
Rob you know I'm not really sure I think
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's a question for a veterinarian but
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
I know that I did have a tighter done
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
through Dr Rob because I wanted to try
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
it and see what happened um and it was
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
fine my local vet had no problem with
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
that I did rtier my dogs because the one
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
with Dr Rob was just um a basic one and
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted the full numbers on my dog
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
so I had it done through my own vet
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
simply because it was easier it's like
 
01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.070 align:start position:0%
simply because it was easier it's like
One-Stop

01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
One-Stop
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
shopping all right thank you any further
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative cont thank
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
question um so to get a tighter test it
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like we we have to draw
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
blood get and if you're using Dr
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
Rob you keep mentioning who drawing the
 
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
blood my local veterinarian was more
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
than willing to draw blood spin it and
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
hand it over to me so that I could send
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
it off to KSU with the label that I had
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
from my transaction with Dr
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
Rob follow up yep thank you Mr chair
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess you know we're hearing
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
testimony saying that the local vet can
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
do it or Dr Rob can do it but
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
technically your local vet has to handle
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
the no matter what is that correct
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
you all right any further questions
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you next we will P pull
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
up uh Joyce
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
aravella uh Mr chair could I um could I
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
just ask a Qui quick question if you
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
before we proceed certainly go ahead

wondering how many uh how many people we
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
have more testifying and uh if you could
 
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
just if it's a relatively short number
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
could you let us know who they are sure
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%

thank you to the committee for listening
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
to my testimony today I'm here
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
representing dog owners of the Granite
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
State uh who opposes this bill um we
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
want to thank Maryann for her thoughtful
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
attempt to solve her concern for her
 
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
dogs and we do understand that there are
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
reactions to the rabies
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine however as this bill is written
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um although intended to allow Provisions
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
for dogs that do not adequately react to
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
Arab vaccine it actually adds
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and unproven testing
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
following rabies vaccines for all dogs
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so if you think about
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
all of the dogs that have to get a
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine and that is everyone
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
who's going to get their dogs licensed
 
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
um you know with few exemptions out
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
there they will all need to follow up
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
that vaccine with a tighter um as I
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
think we're all starting to understand
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
that is costly not just for the test
 
01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639 align:start position:0%
itself self which needs to be shipped
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
out to Kansas State I looked it up and
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
that test runs a minimum of
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
$90 um and then we have to add in the
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
shipping fees and the cost for your
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to draw the blood so that
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
that test can be sent out so you know
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking at over
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
$100 over that in addition to the cost
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the previously done rabies vaccine
 
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
and this is just to check to see if this
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
has indeed had enough antibodies to
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
react to That vaccine what happens if
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
the V the tighter comes back too low now
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
the dog needs to be revaccinated so
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
there's another $50 to
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
$60 and additionally an additional
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
tighter would need to be done uh which
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
is as we stated over $100 there so we're
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
looking at close to
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
$400 just for two rounds if a dog did
 
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.790 align:start position:0%
$400 just for two rounds if a dog did
not

01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
um accept that initial rabies vaccine
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
and that's putting a lot of burden on
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
the dog owners of New Hampshire um as
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
far as you know we're aware we have not
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
been seeing a rise in rabies cases in
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
the pet Community where dogs are not uh
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
accepting these vaccines um so we do
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
feel that our current method of
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
requiring that rabies vaccine is
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient and working properly and the
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
added burden of the these additional
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
costs for titering would probably drive
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
down adherence to rabies vaccines in
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
general um not every person can even
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
afford that additional cost for one
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
round of rabies titering let alone two
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
or potentially even more and that's just
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
for one dog um you know many of us have
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
multiple dogs and that cost would get
 
01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.310 align:start position:0%
multiple dogs and that cost would get
very

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
expensive um I also want to mention that
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's it's hard to require
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
everyone to do titering when titering
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
isn't even approved um in Lo of
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
revaccinated so for standard tighter
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
testing for example um when my dogs need
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
to get their parvo booster or distemper
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
booster we use tighter testing to check
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
their antibodies that's very standard
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
for those type of diseases which are
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
very different than
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
rabies um and we can do that in lie of
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
revaccinated them because if they have
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
the antibodies it shows that they do not
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
actually need to be
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
revaccinated however in the case with
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
rabies um looking at the compendium of
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
animal rabies prevention and control
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
which was referenced earlier by uh
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
Maryanne they are saying that titer do
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
not directly correlate with protection
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
because other immunological factors also
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
play a role in preventing rabies and our
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
abilities to measure and interpret those
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
other factors are not welldeveloped
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
therefore evidence of circulating rabies
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
virus antibodies should not be used as a
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
substitute for current vaccination in
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
managing rabies exposure or determining
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
the need for booster vaccinations in
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
animals uh you can see that in some
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
additional quotes that I have in my
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony that was submitted but
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
I feel that you know until we can
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually trust the rabies tighter as an
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
option for replacing
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
revaccination that it doesn't have a
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
purpose to be written into law to
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
confirm whether a dog has accepted the
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine and may subsequently require an
 
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
additional one um the uh Maryanne excuse
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
me she mentioned that you know the
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was to try and
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
avoid vaccinating dogs who have
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
reactions to the vaccine I actually see
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
this bill as having potential to be over
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinating dogs if that tighter test
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
comes back low which isn't even proven
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
that it means the dog is truly not uh
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
covered by that initial rabies
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine later in the bill it does go on
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
to talk about those who are exempt um
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
and what the protocols would be and I do
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
think that that is an area that we could
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
dig into further because having dogs
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
quar ened muzzled not allowed off lead
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
things like that um because they have
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
had a reaction and have been given an
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
exemption I do agree that we do need to
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of work there but I
 
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
think until rabies vaccines and titers
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
um are proven and legally accepted we
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
should not be putting any requirement in
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
law for their use and we should revisit
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
this part of the law at that time once
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
they are approved um and I would be
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions thank
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
you Angel sounds like we may have uh the
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
makings of another bill here that we'll
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
have to look at for another year any uh
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Murray hi
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question and
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you to miss Ferrari for taking my
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
question so my question is actually
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
around in addition to sort
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the information from the compendium
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
you stated do you have any concerns with
 
01:33:59.109 --> 01:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
um potential you know um if a dog were
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
um to bite somebody would this would
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
this have any potential to maybe cause
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
undo anxieties or or or justly um
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
concern over needing um the a person to
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated themselves against rabies
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
for any reason
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
um that's generally my
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you for your question
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
question um if I if I understand it
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
correctly I I don't think that it would
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
cause any additional concern um current
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
law has been followed very well we have
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
not seen reason to make adjustments to
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
the law with concerns of dogs not
 
01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
accepting that initial rabies vaccine
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
and their follow-ups um so I think you
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
know there might be a community that is
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to grow in concerns with the start
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
of these discussions happening about
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
these rabby titer being available um but
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think that there's just not enough
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
research and documentation that proves
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
that these titers are truly working that
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
we should be relying on them to that
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
extent one one more followup if I may Mr
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair sure go ahead follow um do you
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you know how long
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
roughly it would take to get a TI
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
response back even from one of these
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
facilities or Labs like in the event
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
that something did happen and there was
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
a question about the tighter levels um
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
how long does that process take do you
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
know so in my experience with different
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
Labs it varies um first you have to
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
remember that you need to get into your
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
vet so there's going to be the delay for
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
getting that appointment um nowadays you
 
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
know appointments are few and far
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
between with Co and everything we've
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
been dealing with so there there could
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
be a week delay there then you need to
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
get it shipped off so you're going to
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
probably overnight it so you're going to
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
have another day there and then you need
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the lab receives it
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
within their testing window um otherwise
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
there can be delays added for when they
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
will get to your sample in addition to
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know other samples that they might
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
have ahead of yours I have had it take
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
over a week to get results for other
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
standard testing that I've done I've
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
never had a tighter test for rabies done
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to it specifically but
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
just know that it isn't you know a super
 
01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
just know that it isn't you know a super
fast

01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
turnaround representative
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
Bixby uh thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
Miss Miss faray for taking my question
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
um I uh a couple of questions I and I
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to ask these
 
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.030 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to ask these
questions

01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh the State Vet because um I I think he
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
might I'm I'm I'm sure he has the
 
01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:00.679 align:start position:0%
answers but you might have the answers
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
and he's not going to be able to speak
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
today uh so I was wondering if you have
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
any sense of how prevalent uh rabies is
 
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
in wildlife and and what what the risks
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
are for uh animals getting bitten and
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
having it transferred to
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
pets unfortunately I do not have the
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
answer to that um I have not person
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
ever heard of anyone whose dog has or
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
cat Etc has been bitten and had a
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
concern for rabies um and I have a
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
pretty wide Network within New Hampshire
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
of dog owners due to the dog owners of
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
the Granite State group um but that
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there aren't some out
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
there all right I I I know that he last
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
year he had mentioned that there was a
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
case of a a sheep who had been bitten by
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
something and uh contracted rabies in
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
the town next to mine so that was um so
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
apparently it is out there uh and if I
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
may have a follow up yes go ahead um so
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh you T you brought up some information
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
about the uh the compendium suggesting
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
that there's not um uh that the titer
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
are not really reliable at this moment
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
and um I'm not sure how much you know
 
01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
about the way that the the U the immune
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
system works but Mr do in his testimony
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
Dr Crawford mentioned something about uh
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
there being different types of uh
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
immunity one uh from cell that goes that
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
goes along with cells and one that goes
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
along with antibodies in that that are
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the body fluids and that those it's
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
not really clear how those two work yet
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh but you might have immunity from one
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
but um even if the other doesn't show up
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh do you know anything about
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
that I do not know uh scientifically I
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
have heard you know that there are the
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
two different types of immunity And in
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
regards to how I mentioned parvo and
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
this temper titers those are widely
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
accepted and very reliable um versus the
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
rabies titer are not yet
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
because there is they're a different
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
type of disease um so maybe those are
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
the two type of things that cause them
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be different um but hopefully Dr
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
Crawford will be able to elaborate on
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
that for you thank
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you unfortunately Dr
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Crawford isn't going to be able to
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
testify today he sent in an email he has
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
h a board of Veterinary meeting and so
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
he's unable to be in two places at once
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
but we'll have to help have him work on
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
his Zoom skills and have one in each
 
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
year uh is there any further questions
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
for uh Angela before we let her
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
go well I can't see anymore I just k
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
kick from the webinar so you have any
 
01:40:02.719 --> 01:40:03.750 align:start position:0%
kick from the webinar so you have any
hands

01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
hands
 
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
up uh representative muray did you have
 
01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.709 align:start position:0%
up uh representative muray did you have
another

01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:40:07.719 --> 01:40:10.990 align:start position:0%
another
question

01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
no any further questions from the
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
committee all right thank you Angela we
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
testimony next we will uh bring up Stacy
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
o ber from the American Kennel
 
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
Club good morning everyone thank you for
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
a moment to speak in opposition to house
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
387 as you know the American Kennel Club
 
01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
is a 135 year old nonprofit organization
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's a recognized and trusted expert
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
in K9 Health breeding training and
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
responsible dog ownership um our clubs
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
have raised and our affiliate K9 Health
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation has funded more than $59
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
million in can9 health research um I'm
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
grateful that Miss omera has reflected
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
on the importance of uh strengthening
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
the human can9 bond by participating in
 
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh performance events and other dog
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
sport activities
 
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
AKC sanctioned 141 events in New
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire back in 2019 in which more
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
than 24,000 dogs participated um I just
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
want to not repeat anything that you've
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
heard and a lot of thoughtful questions
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
from committee members which I
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate I just wanted to acknowledge
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
that there is no cure for rabies and
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
it's deadly if it's contracted um and
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a zoonotic disease so it's
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
transmissible among mammals including
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
humans um that being said I think that
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
there has been uh growing questions
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
around this idea of rabies titers
 
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.350 align:start position:0%
around this idea of rabies titers
antibody

01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
antibody
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
titers and my understanding is that the
 
01:42:02.669 --> 01:42:02.679 align:start position:0%
National Association of state public
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
health veterinarians review that
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
compendium on an annual basis and so
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
rather than amending state law which all
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
of the states laws reflect what the
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
compendium which is the expertise of our
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
state public health veterinarians um
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
Stacey I think we lost you oh can you
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
this since they review the compendium
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
annually and look at the scientific
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
literature um again
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
the there was one question about or a
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
point made that some states are
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
requiring rabies virus antibodies and so
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
I do have a link to the compendium in my
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony for you all on page
 
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
four of the compendium um at subsection
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
11 I just want to read one sentence to
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
you it says some jurisdictions require
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
evidence of vaccination and rabies virus
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
antibodies for animal importation
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
purposes so that's the limited use that
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
I see in the compendium when I reviewed
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
it in anticipation of drafting testimony
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
for this morning thank
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you Stacy any questions from
 
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.510 align:start position:0%
you thank you Stacy any questions from
the

01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee all right not see oh
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby just put his hand
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
up go ahead representative Bixby yeah I
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering um uh this is a
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
question asked before and the person and
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Ferrari wasn't able to answer it
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you have any data on the
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
prevalence of uh of rabes in wildlife
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
and you know and how that creates a risk
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
pets sure I can say that I've not seen a
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
lot of transmission by Wildlife to
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
domestic pets what I have seen from the
 
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
perspective of AKC which monitors what
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
goes on across the country is isolated
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
incidents of uh dogs that are
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
transported into this country from other
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
countries uh back in 2019 for instance
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
the United States Centers for Disease
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
Control issued a ban on importing
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
animals from Egypt because there were
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
two uh cases tracked where animals that
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
were imported into the country uh were
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
infected with rabies and ended up in
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
shelters and transmitted that way um so
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
I've seen some examples of where tra
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
rabies has been transmitted into the
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
country but no incidents with regard to
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
Wildlife at least not
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
recently I think the last uh case I saw
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
in Rhode Island was a cat back in 2013
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative that had been bit and uh
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be quarantined and the owner
 
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
unlawfully crossed the state border from
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts into Rhode Island with an
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
infected cat that was supposed to be
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
quarantined um after after a bite but
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
that was the most recent case that I
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
came across thank
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you representative
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
Murray yes thank you Mr chair for taking
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you Miss Ober for
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question isn't it true that um
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines generally for rabies are
 
01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
preventative and prophylactic in nature
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
because once um any symptom would show
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
as you noted um you it's incurable at
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
that point correct that's my
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
understanding yes I've heard uh
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
presentations from State veterinarians
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
where they H could not overemphasize the
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
importance of prevention because there
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
is no cure for
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
rabies thank you it it's it's a deadly
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
death is inevitable if contracted that's
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
correct thank you all right thank you
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Miss
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
obber all right seeing them thank you
 
01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
Miss over appreciate your
 
01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
testimony my pleasure is there anyone
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%

unmute excuse me hope can you hear me
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
now we can go ahead for the record I am
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
Sean Jasper commissioner of the
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
food I appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:47:22.159 --> 01:47:23.830 align:start position:0%
food I appreciate the opportunity to
testify

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition to the bill this
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
morning two previous speakers have said
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
much of what I wanted wanted to um you
 
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
do have the email from Dr Crawford which
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
really goes into into the
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
detail uh of what needs to be said I I
 
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
just think I need to remind everyone
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully I don't though um that the
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
reason we have our pets vaccinated is
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
for human protection not for the prote
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
ction of the pets primarily it's to
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
protect the public from rabies and
 
01:48:00.189 --> 01:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
you've heard that titer is not an
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
indication one way or another as to
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
whether there is um immunity and
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
protection from rabies as much as a one
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
of the previous speakers would like you
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
to believe that it that it is the study
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we waited for last year came out
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
and it did conclude that the current
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
study was not able to Pro Pur prove a
 
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
detective um rabies tighter standard and
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
that was the purpose of the study so in
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the very study that intended to
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
prove the case was unable to do that um
 
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
I I think we all understand that it
 
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
would be unwise at this time to pass a
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill that does not have the scientific
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
proof behind it and um I guess that's
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
really all I need to say at this time
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
and would urge you to uh find this bill
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
an expedient to leg late I'd be glad to
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I might be
 
01:48:55.679 --> 01:48:57.070 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I might be
able

01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
able
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
to thank you commissioner representative
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chair and thank you to
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for taking my question
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you're the right person
 
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
to ask this question but I just thought
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
of it while you spoke do you happen to
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
know the cost of post exposure
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
prophylactic treatment in humans for
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
rabies exposure no I I don't um I know
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
it's changed quite a bit over over the
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
years but um
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh it is not a a
 
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
cheap uh process and certainly um you
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
know once a person has
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
rabies um it's it's a very serious
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
n serious uh disease and um the fact is
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we need to continue to do what
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
state law is um is required to be done
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
at this at this point and as unfortunate
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
it is for animals and the owners of the
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
animals who may have um reactions to the
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
rabies shot I I really believe that um
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
that is secondary to the concern of
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
having um humans exposed to possible
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
rabies thank you thank you uh
 
01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron thank you Mr
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you commissioner for
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
coming today to uh
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
testify in our hearing today U there was
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
some discussion
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
just brief discussion regarding the
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
exemption of animals who have had
 
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
negative reactions to rabies
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination and you know pet owners who
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
opt for this exemption through the state
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
that maran's
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
office um they've expressed the desire
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
to see some sort of easing of the manner
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
by which their animals can be
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
kept do you for see um you know any
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
way in which we might be able to proceed
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
with that uh in a very safe manner so
 
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
that these animals don't have to be
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
um you know so
 
01:51:10.069 --> 01:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
stringently uh especially in a
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
controlled environment in their own
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
home is that something that we might be
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
able to discuss at some point with u
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
with Dr
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
Crawford that might be a subject
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that might be
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
a subject for uh another bill at another
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
another time I certainly don't think
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
currently um I think we'd have to have
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
more information as to how many of these
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
these animals there are out there and I
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
don't have that information I do know
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
that the reaction is extremely rare and
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's according to the um
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
compendium and you know again we're
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
talking about public health here
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
and obviously a dog that is kept
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
isolated and not in an area where
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're exposed to wild animals have a
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
much uh less likely chance of developing
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
rabies but um we need would need to have
 
01:52:12.189 --> 01:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
some serious discussion about this do a
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
lot more research um so while we're
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
always glad to have discussions about
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
these things this um bill is not the
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
again all right thank you any additional
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
Jasper seeing none thank you
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner we appreciate your
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for the
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity is there anyone else that
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill we have Nancy Holmes Nancy did you
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to come
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
on yes this should work am I unmuted now
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
you're are on go ahead Nancy okay great
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
Nancy hes I forgot to introduce myself
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
earlier and of course I'm going to have
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
dog background for your amusement um I I
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
have a couple of things as um
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper said this is about
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
human health um as much as I empathize
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
with Miss Amara's situation with her
 
01:53:13.229 --> 01:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
dogs um this is about keeping people
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
safe to keep people safe you want to
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
increase the compliance with rabies
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
vaccination not decrease it I believe
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
that requiring every dog owner to pay
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
for titers um which are pretty much not
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
conclusive of anything um is not going
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
to increase compliance it's going to
 
01:53:39.149 --> 01:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
decrease it um in my written testimony I
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
have a quote from the CDC about
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
serological titers for rabies titers do
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
not directly correlate with protection
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
because that immunological factors also
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
play a role in preventing r babies um
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
and the ability to measure those is um
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
not developed therefore evidence of in
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
um circulating rabies virus antibodies
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
should not be used as a substitute for
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
current vaccination and managing rabies
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
exposures are determining the need for
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
booster vaccinations in animals so the
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
CDC says no and I kind of believe them
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that we have a
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place right now where you
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
go in and at like three to four months
 
01:54:29.709 --> 01:54:29.719 align:start position:0%
you get your puppy vaccinated for
 
01:54:32.589 --> 01:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
rabies it known that that might not
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
completely cover it so that before the
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
dog is a year old you get a second
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination to increase the response to
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
um the rabies virus um so we've already
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
got a situation in place where we're
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
we're planning for is a potential for a
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
few dogs not to be immunized with that
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
first shot so you go for a second one
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and then you I believe the next series
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
is you get the next vaccine a year after
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
that second one and then after that you
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
can do a three-year vaccine um there is
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Bixby was asking
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
about rabies we have both Fox and
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
raccoon rabies as far as I know in the
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
state and um I know there are situations
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
where animals have been exposed I know
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
the situations where humans have been
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
exposed exposed to wild animals with
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
gravies um I think the most recent one I
 
01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
can remember is the coyote that the
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
father had to beat off of his little kid
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
um I personally have seen a raccoon in
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
the middle of the street attacking car
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
tires as they went by that was a sick
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
animal that was most likely in my
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
opinion rabies um you know the other
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
thing is should this go forward and dogs
 
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
be able to go out in public without a
 
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
muzzle without being on a leash be
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
boarded be in groups and so on without
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
that rabies vaccine um is it going to be
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
the owner's responsibility to notify all
 
01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
the people who may come in contact with
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
this animal that their dog is not
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
immunized against rabies um what kind of
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
impact is that going to have on Doggy
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
Daycare workers on people who Bard
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
animals and and so on I just don't think
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
it's safe I mean I certainly wouldn't
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
want my dogs going to even uh a dog part
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
situation where unmuzzled unvaccinated
 
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
um against rabies dogs was was there uh
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
is simply for the safety of the dogs and
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
the people who are also there um I'm
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
looking to see if I had anything else I
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
had my notes for for um um you know the
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh the only the only other thing I had
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
was that um I think everybody who's
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
spoken against this bill as I am um is
 
01:56:53.229 --> 01:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
taking into account the best interests
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the most animals and the most people
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
I have a great deal of empathy for Miss
 
01:56:59.709 --> 01:56:59.719 align:start position:0%
Amara not being able to compete with her
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
dogs but lack of rabies vaccination is
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
not the only thing that would keep
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from doing that and you still
 
01:57:08.589 --> 01:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
keep and love the dogs and comply
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
whatever their needs are whether it be
 
01:57:13.229 --> 01:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
they've ripped a cruciate ligament or or
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
something else so saying well I can't
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
compete in sports with my dogs because
 
01:57:20.669 --> 01:57:20.679 align:start position:0%
they haven't had their rabies vaccine um
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think that is is valid um you
 
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
know I think this bill needs to be ited
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Holmes any
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
committee all right see none we
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony yes all right
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's the last hand we have so I will
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
this time remember to read the blue
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
sheet as I forgot to on the last bill so
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
we have uh 87 people signed in one in
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
support excuse 88 signed in one in
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
support one opposed and one
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
neutral all right with that I'm going to
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on uh HB 387 and we
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
have about one minute we're gonna open
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%

to be here
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
who should we ask questions uh about the
 
02:00:24.719 --> 02:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
who should we ask questions uh about the
bill

02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
to I obviously not not representive Aon
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
I I think you probably have to ask them
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
of the folks that are testifying as we
 
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
go forward okay thank you very you're
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
very welcome so we'll uh bring up back

02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
Holmes oh aren't I lucky and aren't you
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
guys lucky here I am again welcome back
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
I sent in sent in written testimony on
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
this in which I included a couple of
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
pictures for for your amusement um one
 
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
is of the same dog at different ages
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the dog looks
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
completely different we won't discuss
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
how the dog looked once groomed down to
 
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
have less coat than that the other
 
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
picture I sent in was a pair of cats one
 
02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
is my orange cat and one is my cat that
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
when I got him he looked like a tabby
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
Siamese not long after that he darkened
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
up because he has a Siamese Gene
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
although he was a barn cat and
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
those pictures of the white cat and the
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
dark tabby cat are the same
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
animal um my point in all of this is
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
that pictures on a rabies vaccination
 
02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
certificate are absolutely useless um I
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
defy most people to be able to tell the
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
difference between um any number of
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
different dogs that are the same color
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
and the same sex um most most of you may
 
02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
have at some point or other tripped over
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
a dog show on TV or it maybe actually
 
02:01:58.750 --> 02:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
watched one in person um one of the
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
comments I frequently hear or heard at
 
02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
dog shows was how is the judges telling
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
them apart now you have to have a
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
trained eye to be able to do that I'm
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to give you one more anecdote um
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
just to let you understand how how
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
useless this process would be um never
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
mind clly but just useless I had a young
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
woman come and visit my house with a
 
02:02:24.990 --> 02:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
puppy of the breed that I raised um she
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
asked if she could put the puppy down to
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
play with my dogs I had some similar age
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
and some older ones at at that time
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
after a few minutes the owner in a panic
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
a asked me but which one is mine now
 
02:02:40.589 --> 02:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
this is a puppy she'd had for six weeks
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
and putting it down in a bunch of
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
similar dogs she could not pick her
 
02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
puppy out of the pack fortunately I
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
could although I was tempted to say no
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
no it's that one I didn't you know I let
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
her go go home with her puppy um but uh
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know this is the problem is people
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
never mind people in person can't tell
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
one dog from another never mind in a
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
picture so I don't see any point to it
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then you go into all of the cost to
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian which will be passed on
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
to the owner um and you know again I'm
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
right back to raby's compliance we want
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
more people to comply with getting their
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
animals rabies vaccinations rabies is
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we don't want to
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
price it out of the reach of the average
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
person I personally can't imagine trying
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
to run a rabies clinic with with uh you
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
know 25 people in line waiting for their
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
animal to get a shot and then try to get
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
pictures of all these animals in some
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
fire station um it just doesn't seem
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
practical to me I think this bill really
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be itl and I would be happy to
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
take any
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
questions you Misses any questions from
 
02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
the committee representative NOA thank
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
you ch
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do you
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
do you are you uh do you happen to know
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
the impetus for requiring photos I'm I'm
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
not a little clear on exactly why a
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
photo would be
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
necessary um I know I don't know if uh
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
Miss obber is going to testify or not
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
but I um I did ask the the primary
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill if he could explain
 
02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
what the purpose was because I'm sure it
 
02:04:16.990 --> 02:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
had a good purpose you know and a good
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
intent but um Miss Ober did say that she
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
had heard back from the primary sponsor
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it was supposedly in response to a
 
02:04:29.709 --> 02:04:29.719 align:start position:0%
um um a constituent concern that they
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
may have gotten the wrong rabies
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
certificate for their animal um and so I
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think that was it I think most
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are pretty good about
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
making sure the right um certificate
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
goes with the right pet um and uh the
 
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
only thing I could see is maybe it had
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
been a sales situation where the person
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure but my problem is in in I
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
say 9 99.9% of the time nobody could say
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
for sure that the picture was of the
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
same animal that the person had sitting
 
02:05:00.189 --> 02:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
in front of them anyway so I don't think
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's a valuable um addition to the
 
02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
certificate thank
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
you additional questions from his homes
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.470 --> 02:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
muted thank you very much um thank you
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Sher for taking my question and thank
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
you Miss Holmes for taking my question
 
02:05:29.549 --> 02:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
um in reviewing the piece of legislation
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of um what what the
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
method would be for attaching this um
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
photograph and also what size of
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
photograph might be required I'm wasn't
 
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
photograph might be required I'm wasn't
entirely

02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
clear you know I have to say I I have no
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
idea what the intent was my my Su um
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
original impression was that probably
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
probably they're expecting a color print
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
out of the picture on the Raby
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
certificate I don't get an actual
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
physical form when I get a Raby
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
certificate my vet prints one off of
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
their computer system and that's the
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
same as what is sent to my town um there
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
are I'm sure official RAB certificates
 
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
that you can get for veterinarians who
 
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
who don't do it that way um like perhaps
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
at a rabies clinic I just haven't had
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
one of those in a long time I suppose
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
you could print a picture and staple it
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
um but you know what the intent is um
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
what the size would be what requirements
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
there might be for
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
clarity um you know the ability of the
 
02:06:31.549 --> 02:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
person to take a picture if any of you
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
have tried to take pictures of your pets
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know they can be
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
non-cooperative um so I I I don't really
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
know I just can't see it as having any
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
added value to the rabies certificate
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know and uh un unless you have that
 
02:06:47.069 --> 02:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
purple and pink polka doted dog that
 
02:06:49.629 --> 02:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
nobody else
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
had thank you thank you for
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:06:56.430 --> 02:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bon thank you
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and thank you Miss Holmes
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
for uh taking the question um I I know
 
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit about technology
 
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
and and databases and whatnot and I'm
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
wondering the Bill's not exactly clear
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
but it it sounds like the the town clerk
 
02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
may have to retain a copy of this of
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
this photo and I know a lot of towns are
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
are electronic these days I I imagine
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
that would dramatically incre increase
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of database storage capacity
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
that a town may have to have and I
 
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
imagine that would be pretty expensive
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
would you say that's probably correct
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
well in in the world of computers my
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is is that storage is the
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
cheapest cost of any um but yes it would
 
02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
it would be an increased burden on the
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
towns to handle that I know the way that
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
my my veterinarian sends in um the rabes
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
certificates to my town is they put it
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
in the envelope and mail it and they may
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of the week mail all the ones
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
that go to my particular town from their
 
02:07:59.069 --> 02:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
practice um so that you would be then
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
sitting there and um what happens is the
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh in my town anyway the as I follow the
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
procedure is the clerk enters the
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
information into um their database or
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet whichever way they're
 
02:08:17.069 --> 02:08:17.079 align:start position:0%
working it now and then um the uh I
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
think the actual certificate it itself
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
is not retained there
 
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I can I can see this as just
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
being a little more stuff in the
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
landfill thank you thank you any
 
02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:32.980 align:start position:0%
landfill thank you thank you any
additional

02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:32.990 align:start position:0%

02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Miss HS
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you next we will bring up Angela
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
Ferrari from dog owners of the Granite
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you can you hear me we can go
 
02:08:52.549 --> 02:08:52.559 align:start position:0%
ahead Miss Ferrari great thank you all
 
02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh for listening to me testify again on
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
HB 322 now um we defin dog owners at the
 
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
granite state opposes this bill as me
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the chairman uh we have
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the potential for this
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
addition to the rabies vaccination to
 
02:09:13.790 --> 02:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
drive up costs um there's going to be
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
additional time needed for veterinarians
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
to work into their visit to get this
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
photo they'll also need to have access
 
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
to a c camera colored printers ink and
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
of course storage space to maintain
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
these records whether that be with the
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
veterinarian the town clerk or whatnot
 
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned by Miss Holmes there is
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
so much similarity between cats dogs and
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
ferrets especially of the same breed
 
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
that we feel the photos would have a low
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of proving an animals
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
identity we also had some questions on
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know would this be just a photo of
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
the animal's head would that be from the
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
front or the side should it be of the
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
full body should the animal be standing
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
or sitting uh or would it depend on what
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
would prove the identity of the animal
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
and who would make that decision so I
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
think it could get very complicated with
 
02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies of photos uh being taken
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
and used let alone for quality and
 
02:10:11.790 --> 02:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
Clarity of those
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
photos we were trying to understand um
 
02:10:18.189 --> 02:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
who the bill actually benefits and
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately still trying to understand
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
the problem that the bill is is trying
 
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
to solve so it is unfortunate that we
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
didn't have it introduced to get some of
 
02:10:26.239 --> 02:10:27.069 align:start position:0%
didn't have it introduced to get some of
that

02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
Clarity I also uh lastly just wanted to
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
mention that I think it is a slippery
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
slope um wondering if this could
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to health certificates
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
requiring colored photos next and
 
02:10:41.149 --> 02:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
knowing all of the discussions we've had
 
02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the database for health
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
certificates um we could have costly
 
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
impacts there for the Department of
 
02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and foods for
 
02:10:52.109 --> 02:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
storing those addition
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
photos and with that I would be happy to
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
take any
 
02:10:59.790 --> 02:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
questions do we have any questions from
 
02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.709 align:start position:0%
questions do we have any questions from
Miss

02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
Ferrari all right seeing none thank you
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank
 
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chair I have a just a question
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
for you um do we have anyone who is
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
listed as being testifying in
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
support uh no we do not
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you not not testifying we have
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
three in support who signed in on the

blue sheet but there's no one no one
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%

come back into exec session and we're
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to EXA House Bill
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
322 and I am looking to representative
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
kto for a motion Mr chair I'd like to

motion uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill um adding a t photograph uh
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
would add
 
02:19:24.509 --> 02:19:24.519 align:start position:0%
an additional cost to getting the raby's
 
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine and not only that is what we
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony is that um it's you
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
may not know there similar dogs that
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
look the same be in the same town or
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
even within the same family so you
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
really the pict really is not a good
 
02:19:43.950 --> 02:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
identification um and
 
02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
again this is a well I understand the
 
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
intention and it's well intention bill

for prime time yet and um the research
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
is just not
 
02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
where we need it to be to make it move
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
forward at this time it has a huge
 
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
downside in the fact that rabies
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
transmission to humans is to is um
 
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.560 align:start position:0%

Bixby and I guess I'll recognize myself
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
to so House Bill 250 seeks to uh well
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
actually I could speak the amendment
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
first I'm sorry so House Bill 250 seeks
 
02:26:59.550 --> 02:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
to uh change some uh change the
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
requirements to 30 dogs 35 cats
 
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
and it also provides and that's for the
 
02:27:10.269 --> 02:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
pet vendor regulations it also provides
 
02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
for the moving the an exemption to allow
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
for uh anybody that has a situation
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
where every four years they are
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
in uh have not qualified to be a pet
 
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
vendor previously but find them
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
themselves in the situation perhaps with
 
02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
a large litter that uh is going to put
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
them over the
 
02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
threshold additionally this uh since
 
02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is a replace all for the I
 
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me the amendment is a
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
replace all for the bill I guess I have
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
to actually speak to the whole thing so
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
it also looks to re um change the date
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
of registration period versus the
 
02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
licensing period we had a lot
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
conversation on that portion especially
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
when we were hearing it and their
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative Balden brought up a valid
 
02:27:59.710 --> 02:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
point about a date change that needed to
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
occur because we had the wrong incorrect
 
02:28:06.429 --> 02:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
date so on line 32 you will see that
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
we've corrected the date to instead of
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
December 31st it is now June 30th which
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
aligns properly with the uh with the
 
02:28:19.389 --> 02:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
correct period the final portion of this
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
bill is that uh puts a language into
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
statute that clarifies a zoning problem
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
that occurred back in June of the budget
 
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
in June of 19 that when this all of this
 
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
language was originally put in so what
 
02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
this will do is it will put the zoning
 
02:28:40.590 --> 02:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
changes back to excuse me the zoning
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
requirements back to what it was prior
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the change in 19 which was the will
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the legislature in the
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
with that that pretty much uh identifies
 
02:28:53.710 --> 02:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on is there any
 
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:55.800 align:start position:0%

Bill

02:33:56.590 --> 02:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:58.150 align:start position:0%
Bill
366

02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
366
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
um that there more work to be
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
submitted thank you I would further add
 
02:34:18.510 --> 02:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
that uh while this is my bill like we
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
recognize and I recognize I when I
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
introduced it that there there's more
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
work it's sort of a contentious Topic at
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
times you know because uh we have a lot
 
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
of animal
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
cruelty concerns that do occur and
 
02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they are related to hoarding
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
and so we were seeking to find a
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
definition that would define that and
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
help the the animals that are taken into
 
02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
custody during that and you know during
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
these situations and all the also help
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to find a smooth
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
transition through this mostly to help
 
02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
the folks that suffer from hoarding
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
disease and as we heard a lot of
 
02:34:58.510 --> 02:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
testimony there's many that do that find
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
themselves in these situations relating
 
02:35:03.309 --> 02:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
to you know being in trouble with the
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
law and having situations where they're
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
not able to care for their animals
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's no fault of their own
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
intentionally but it's a situation that
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
occurs related to their disease so I
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
think we need U some more input on this
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
from criminal justice as far as it's
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
going to relate to
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
how it moves through the system and how
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is able to uh determine
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
the part that would be placed on them
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
about deciding who was a order so for
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
that reason I support the
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
retain is there any additional comments
 
02:35:35.790 --> 02:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
or questions from the committee uh
 
02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative bixman yes uh thank you
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my comment um I just wanted
 
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
to um point out that I I thought that
 
02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
during our public hearing on this we had
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
a very good discussion of the issues and
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
it sound it seemed like everyone was
 
02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
really directed towards finding a
 
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
solution for the problem and uh it's
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
just the solution isn't quite uh
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
solidified yet so I'm I'm looking
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
forward to being able to working on this
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
further with uh uh in uh in it's
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
retained form and coming out with
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%

sent everybody a letter of support that
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
we received from an industry group uh
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
and this is going uh I'll be discussing
 
02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
it when we exec HB
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%

02:38:49.630 --> 02:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game thank you
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
actually I think we're at a point where
 
02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to break for lunch
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
because uh this is the my intended
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
schedule going forward for the rest of
 
02:38:58.890 --> 02:38:58.900 align:start position:0%
the day we have
 
02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:00.309 align:start position:0%
the day we have
[Music]

02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:39:04.110 --> 02:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh we have House Bill 437 that we're
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
hearing at
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
1M House Bill 367 that we're hearing at
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
1:30 and House Bill 413 that we're
 
02:39:13.389 --> 02:39:13.399 align:start position:0%
hearing at 2
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
pm we will um I doubt we'll have much
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
time to EXA in between any of those
 
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
hearings where I only haven't scheduled
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
for a half hour but immediately
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
following the hearing at 2 pm we will be
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
executing the remaining bills and I
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
intend to exec
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
um House Bill
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh 272 right first right after the
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearing as a courtesy to representative
 
02:39:40.030 --> 02:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
coner because he wanted to be available
 
02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
and then we will exact House Bill 177
 
02:39:44.990 --> 02:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
right after that so my best guess is
 
02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
around 2:45 and then we'll proceed on
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
from there to the remaining bills that
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
we have so with that we're going to go
 
02:39:55.469 --> 02:39:55.479 align:start position:0%
into recess until 100 p.m. and we will
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:18.319 --> 02:40:48.230 align:start position:0%

coma to introduce the bill and
 
04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
implementation of the Meat Inspection
 
04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
program thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
committee members um this bill is being
 
04:01:09.149 --> 04:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
brought forth um to establish study
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
commit to study the shortage of animal
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
spotter processing facilities in New
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the reason this is
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
important is it's about food security
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
for our uh constituents in New Hampshire
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
currently um if you want to take an
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
animal to slaughter and sell it to the
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
2022 um and New Hampshire we only have a
 
04:01:40.710 --> 04:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
certain amount of USDA facilities
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
currently in there and they are solid um
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
if you're a new farmer trying to get
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
into the business you're not going to
 
04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
get an appointment um for at least a
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
year so it really is something that
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed people have really
 
04:01:58.469 --> 04:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
looked uh especially during the pandemic
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
about buying local food and um it's
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
creating an issue um I know Farmers that
 
04:02:09.550 --> 04:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
have now since this been pic has started
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
that won't sell people from out of state
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
are calling up looking for meat and
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
they'll only sell to their existing
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
customers customer base because they
 
04:02:20.429 --> 04:02:20.439 align:start position:0%
just can't get their their animals
 
04:02:22.389 --> 04:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
processed in a timely
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
manner um and it could open up a whole
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
other lot of issues if people can't get
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
their animals processed um also so I
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
would urge that the committee would to
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
take a look at this we already have a
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
Meat Inspection program established dur
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
in RSA 427 col
 
04:02:47.229 --> 04:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
um that was established several years
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
ago and uh for one reason or another
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's never been funded but it's
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to look at
 
04:02:57.149 --> 04:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
and also you know that might not be the
 
04:02:58.830 --> 04:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
answer for New Hampshire but we need to
 
04:03:00.590 --> 04:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
actually we need to look at seeing how
 
04:03:00.600 --> 04:03:01.590 align:start position:0%
actually we need to look at seeing how
we

04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
can help farmers in the state and get
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
food to folks that want Local Foods so I
 
04:03:09.309 --> 04:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
will entertain any
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative did
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
did you discuss the uh Amendment as
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
well changes in that I believe well I
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
read the amendment oh you did okay I'm
 
04:03:20.800 --> 04:03:21.950 align:start position:0%
read the amendment oh you did okay I'm
sorry

04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
establishing fa in hsh gotcha okay is is
 
04:03:29.790 --> 04:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
there any uh questions for excuse me for
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative on this representative
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah thank you Mr chair and
 
04:03:37.710 --> 04:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions can
 
04:03:40.269 --> 04:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
you expound a little bit on the reason
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
or reasons for this uh delay in hooking
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
up processing USDA slaughterers what's
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
contributing to this problem um more and
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
more uh because there's more animals
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
being processed there's more demand for
 
04:04:00.510 --> 04:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
local foods and if you want to sell to
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
the public you have to get a process
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
through USDA facility now we
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
have USDA approved facilities but
 
04:04:10.990 --> 04:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
they're not USDA inspected facilities so
 
04:04:12.750 --> 04:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
there is a difference and there are a
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
lot of good me butches so if you're
 
04:04:16.750 --> 04:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
doing an animal for yourself you can
 
04:04:18.189 --> 04:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
take it to you don't have to take it to
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
a USDA facility but if you want to sell
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
it to the
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
public you have to take it to a USDA
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
facility and there's only a certain
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
state go ahead follow up so um for your
 
04:04:34.229 --> 04:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
own consumption or maybe you have a
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
friend or relative and uh that's more or
 
04:04:39.149 --> 04:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
less like a gift instead of a commercial
 
04:04:42.910 --> 04:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
sale that would also be free of the USDA
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
obligation maybe or is that a Gray Line
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't go there don't go there
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.309 --> 04:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
questions Murray did you have a question
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
I did so um so and just so we're clear
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
these are two different avenu of lenser
 
04:05:11.229 --> 04:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct so there is the USDA
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
and what you're seeking to do is get the
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
um state inspection facility up and
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
running so that there would be two
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneous avenues for for Farmers to
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
choose from uh no what I'm this is
 
04:05:27.070 --> 04:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
proposing is to do a study to see what
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
the barriers are for New Hampshire Farm
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
is facing accessing Slaughter facilities
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
also to look at approaches of improving
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
availability of Slaughter facilities and
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
possibly implementing the Meat
 
04:05:39.790 --> 04:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
Inspection program I it we really need
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
to do a broad study to see what's best
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire I mean it could be
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
one the other it could be only one but
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want to limit ourselves to just
 
04:05:51.070 --> 04:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
a Meat Inspection program because we
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
want to do what's best for New Hampshire
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
and if we just say we're going to study
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
the Meat Inspection program we're
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
committee hey thank you uh
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you had your hand
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
up now it's down did you have a question
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh I did I did but uh representative
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
comp uh pretty much just covered what I
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
was going to ask to cover so all right
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm good for now I do have a slightly
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
separate question do you know if Rob
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
Johnson is going to be testifying he is
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.950 --> 04:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
thanks any uh further questions for
 
04:06:29.960 --> 04:06:33.710 align:start position:0%
thanks any uh further questions for
representative

04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
contor uh repres Stapleton yes thank you
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you for taking my
 
04:06:39.120 --> 04:06:40.269 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you for taking my
additional

04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:06:40.279 --> 04:06:42.229 align:start position:0%
additional
questions

04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
um it addition to the volume in the
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
market are we also experiencing labor um
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
skilled labor shortage for this
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
particular occupation and and um
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
individual butchers um are they USDA
 
04:07:04.510 --> 04:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
certified um to
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
perform um commercial butchering or is
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
it the slaughterhouse that becomes uh
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
the USDA qualified
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure so if you're a USDA
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
slaughterhouse or USDA butcher it's it's
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
all one in the same okay where a butcher
 
04:07:26.349 --> 04:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
may not be a slaughterer but they would
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
not be USDA certified because to be USDA
 
04:07:30.429 --> 04:07:30.439 align:start position:0%
certified your animal actually has to be
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
brought to the facility where it's going
 
04:07:35.590 --> 04:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
to be butchered and put down at that
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
much any additional questions
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Mason yeah I I guess I'm
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just old enough to know and been in
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
the livestock industry long enough um we
 
04:07:54.429 --> 04:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
used to have state inspection we used to
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
have state slaughterous inspectors and
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
and and we we moved away from them uh
 
04:08:02.349 --> 04:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
the parallel was very close and allowed
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
us to get our our product over the
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
market line and sold I I I have to um
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
concur to what um representative
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
Stapleton asked is is this more of a
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
labor issue today to find the people
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
that are work in those fields and and
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
and do that and and what would the
 
04:08:22.590 --> 04:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
difference you know I don't see what the
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
differences would be that much between
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
USDA stamp meat and New Hampshire stamp
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
meat um I do know uh to sell your Meats
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and have any type of insurance for
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
yourself it needs to come out of a
 
04:08:39.950 --> 04:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
processed plant that has a USDA stamp on
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
it um otherwise you can't buy product
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
liability on from the insurance
 
04:08:48.910 --> 04:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
companies for this so U we Market myself
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
we Market lambs and and uh my brother
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
markets beef and and and we do that
 
04:08:57.149 --> 04:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
every year and that gets marketed all
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
USDA um so I'm just I wrestle with it if
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a so represent what was your
 
04:09:07.389 --> 04:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
question my question is you know have
 
04:09:09.109 --> 04:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
you have you done any research as to
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
whyatt went away to begin with um thank
 
04:09:12.880 --> 04:09:14.469 align:start position:0%
whyatt went away to begin with um thank
you

04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh so the answer to your question is no
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
I haven't really delved into why it went
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
away um I didn't really realize that we
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
had one at one point um the other issue
 
04:09:29.109 --> 04:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
too that we're having with a lot of farm
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
having with expected me especially when
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with pork um is that you
 
04:09:39.309 --> 04:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
can bring it to a USDA house have it uh
 
04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
slaughtered have a usdaa sticker on it
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
but if you want bacon
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
then it creates whole other process
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
because you can't unwrap that bacon and
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
then smoke it somewhere else it actually
 
04:09:52.510 --> 04:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
has to be at a usdaa facility and there
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
aren't a lot of them around I mean
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues with
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
um with processing animals that need to
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
be addressed and I don't know what the
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
the answers are and that's why I'm
 
04:10:07.710 --> 04:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
asking for the
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
study thank you representative any
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you for your
 
04:10:20.189 --> 04:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
testimony next we will uh bring up Rob
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you Mr chairman can you
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%

04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
Rob uh thanks again Mr chairman and
 
04:10:35.229 --> 04:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:10:37.349 --> 04:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
my name is Rob Johnson and I represent
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Farm be as a
 
04:10:42.550 --> 04:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
federation's policy director and we are
 
04:10:42.560 --> 04:10:43.870 align:start position:0%
federation's policy director and we are
supportive

04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the amended bill the bill that
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
broadens the study from not just looking
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
at the the state state inspection but
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
also other capacity and inspection
 
04:10:57.149 --> 04:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
issues and this has been
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
a a a long uh ongoing longtime issue
 
04:11:05.630 --> 04:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
back in 2003 uh fine Bureau was part of
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
a study looking at the slaugh of
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
capacity and all and and then uh just
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic hitting last spring it
 
04:11:16.830 --> 04:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
really brought it to a head with the
 
04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
closures of the a number of the large
 
04:11:22.229 --> 04:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
facilities mostly located mostly in the
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
Midwest and and also with animals that
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't be processed out there
 
04:11:29.870 --> 04:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
especially pigs that were coming here uh
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
in in uh being purchased and in the
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
processing needs to give you an idea of
 
04:11:39.630 --> 04:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
of of the the issue I I saw it uh read a
 
04:11:41.309 --> 04:11:41.319 align:start position:0%
statistic the other day and I don't
 
04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
remember it exactly I'll try to find it
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
but it was just over
 
04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
80% of all the livestock processed in
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
this country are processed at its 13 or
 
04:11:51.479 --> 04:11:52.710 align:start position:0%
this country are processed at its 13 or
14

04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
14
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
facilities just over 80% of 13 or 14
 
04:11:57.600 --> 04:11:59.790 align:start position:0%
facilities just over 80% of 13 or 14
facilities

04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:12:02.590 --> 04:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Stapleton with his one
 
04:12:04.510 --> 04:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
of his questions he he kind of Hit the
 
04:12:06.670 --> 04:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
issue and it's why we would ask we're
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of the amendment which
 
04:12:10.469 --> 04:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
expands the study it's it's taking a
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
look at the workforce issue
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
that that is that that was a big part of
 
04:12:18.910 --> 04:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
the the the problem um one of our
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
facilities in state has told us that
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
they would hire eight people today if
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
they could find them we had another
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
facility that that over this past summer
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
was down to
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
employees which which contributed to the
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
their ability to service their customers
 
04:12:38.590 --> 04:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
in in the backlog
 
04:12:38.600 --> 04:12:41.950 align:start position:0%
in in the backlog
backlog

04:12:41.950 --> 04:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
we really think the area where we could
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
make some inroads and where this study
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
committee would be a particular uh
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
benefit would be again on that that
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the the workforce side of
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
things and maybe working uh with our uh
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh our uh uh uh Community Technical
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
Schools and and and such on on the
 
04:13:08.710 --> 04:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
training that is needed year years ago
 
04:13:12.429 --> 04:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
oh up until I think the mid 80s uh or
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
late 80s early 90s right in there UNH
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
had a meets program and they had a a a a
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
facility that that where they could
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
train students and and we no longer have
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
that they they they sold that off
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess just to answer a a couple
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
other of the questions that came up
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative steton asked the question
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
about what about uh if you're if the
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
meat is being processed for your own
 
04:13:41.149 --> 04:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
consumption well that that would be at a
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
custom exempt facility like when when
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
somebody with uh deer hunters that's
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
where they bring their deer and and that
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
that that meat can then be given away or
 
04:13:55.389 --> 04:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
or or used for their personal um
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
use one thing to to to be aware of is
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to to state Meat
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
Inspection itself there
 
04:14:08.109 --> 04:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
are right around 26 27 uh states that
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
have state programs but that uh that
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
meat the state St inspected meat must be
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
equal to or greater than those
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
inspection programs must be equal to or
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
greater than the federal program so I
 
04:14:23.950 --> 04:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
could tell you that the that when we've
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
talked about this with the commissioner
 
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
you know he's pointed that out and and
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
he's also pointed out that he hasn't
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
seen the demand he hasn't had anybody
 
04:14:36.030 --> 04:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
come to him saying I want to open a
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
state inspected facility because in many
 
04:14:42.109 --> 04:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
ways it it it it it the why would you
 
04:14:43.710 --> 04:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
open just a state and Spector facility
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
and limit yourself to only being able to
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
process meat that could be sold within
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when for really the same
 
04:14:53.149 --> 04:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
the the the same cost uh you know the um
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
you you you could open a facility where
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
your meat could be sold the meat could
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
go anywhere so there's there's not not
 
04:15:01.269 --> 04:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
that we're opposed to take a look at our
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
our the program we have on the books but
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's questionable whether would
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
be it's really
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
useful um and to answer the question
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
about that yes New Hampshire did have a
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
a state program that that went off the
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
books I believe it was 1976 give or take
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
a year and at the time the the go the
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
the state decided why why should we have
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
a program when the federal government
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
could pay for pay for the same
 
04:15:29.000 --> 04:15:30.750 align:start position:0%
could pay for pay for the same
program

04:15:30.750 --> 04:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
essentially and with with that Mr chair
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll I'll be happy to answer any
 
04:15:40.630 --> 04:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you uh Rob is
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
there any questions for Rob
 
04:15:43.040 --> 04:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
there any questions for Rob
representative

04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
Murray I did thank you for taking my
 
04:15:50.109 --> 04:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
question so I I was hearing you talk a
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about the state meet
 
04:15:55.109 --> 04:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
inspection pro program limiting that
 
04:15:56.429 --> 04:15:56.439 align:start position:0%
meet solely to the state of New
 
04:15:58.109 --> 04:15:58.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you're you're seeming to
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
indicate that potentially the meat like
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
an online sale type of meat could not
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
occur with State inspected meat is that
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
am I inferring that
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
correctly I I believe so the meat the
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
meat has to be is the intention of the
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
statute is it's consumed in in in the
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.309 --> 04:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
correct any further questions all right
 
04:16:27.319 --> 04:16:29.429 align:start position:0%
correct any further questions all right
uh

04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:29.439 --> 04:16:30.990 align:start position:0%
uh
representative

04:16:30.990 --> 04:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:16:34.109 --> 04:16:34.119 align:start position:0%
xby yes uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
rob for taking my question um it's
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
actually more like a request for
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
information I I think that um a number
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
of people on the committee might not not
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
be uh really familiar with the way that
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh the USDA inspection program works and
 
04:16:56.590 --> 04:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh and in and um might not have a sense
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
of you know how many facilities are
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
available to New Hampshire farmers at
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
the moment and if you could just uh and
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
also the distinction between a USDA
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
inspected um in um inspected facility
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
where you have an inspector on site
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
versus a um
 
04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
custom facility that is just um where
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
the facility is certified so if you
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
could just describe how that system
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
works uh that might be nice certainly
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
certainly well that in New Hampshire we
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
we currently have four federally
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
inspected facilities those facilities
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
are located in
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
Conway um Center
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
and uh State uh excuse
 
04:17:54.990 --> 04:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
me at a federal inspected facility what
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're in they're inspecting not only
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
the facility itself but they're
 
04:17:59.950 --> 04:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
inspecting each
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
animal that does not happen at what I
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
refer to as a custom exempt facility
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is basically everything else other
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
than a a state or federal the at the at
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
a at a custom exempt facility which we
 
04:18:13.149 --> 04:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
also have in the State uh the there is
 
04:18:14.990 --> 04:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
some state and federal oversight but
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
again they're looking at the facility
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
not at the animals that's that's the
 
04:18:18.359 --> 04:18:22.030 align:start position:0%
not at the animals that's that's the
difference

04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:24.269 --> 04:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
there in representative Bixby I think
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
you asked three questions and I've only
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
answered two uh
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
I yeah so the
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I I I guess one of the uh I think
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
something that you mentioned to me
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
earlier was the uh how the I I I think
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
you my question what I asked you but
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a followup um how is the
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
um the inspector paid for uh that that
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
would be at a uh USDA inspected facility
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
and how would that how does that work if
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's a state plan yeah no thank you yeah
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
that that that's a that's a good point
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
at a the federal government pays for the
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
inspectors at a at a federal facility if
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
if at a with a state program and and Dr
 
04:19:13.870 --> 04:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
Crawford did a lot of work on on on uh
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
developing this the state program and
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
what what he attempted to do there
 
04:19:19.389 --> 04:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
because the the would be the state would
 
04:19:23.149 --> 04:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay and so in putting together
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire program that's on
 
04:19:29.309 --> 04:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
the books that the the the uh the way it
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
worked out was that the the user would
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
would have to pay uh a good part of of
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
the the in the uh inspector's wage the
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
the thief to to to pay for the inspector
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
and and with the the the program that
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
they that was developed was the using
 
04:19:54.990 --> 04:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarians uh to to uh uh inspect uh
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
animals at at a state facility and as I
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
understand it one of the the the main uh
 
04:20:06.030 --> 04:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
issues that USDA had with the the
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
program was that these inspectors would
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
not be uh state employees and they had
 
04:20:13.710 --> 04:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
some concerns that there was not that
 
04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
oversight at least that was one of their
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
issues okay thank you uh representative
 
04:20:25.710 --> 04:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
Stapleton uh thank you Mr chair and
 
04:20:28.349 --> 04:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr Johnson for taking my
 
04:20:32.109 --> 04:20:32.119 align:start position:0%
question I'm curious uh your experience
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
about that uh those training programs at
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
UNH that were discontinued in the late
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
80s U how how extensive were they like
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
an asso degree level or night training
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
few hours a few weeks what what did it
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
consist of how long was it yeah my
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
understanding representative was it was
 
04:20:57.670 --> 04:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
it was pretty high level it it was it
 
04:21:00.510 --> 04:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
was it was uh it was basically part of
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
their a meets program and for for or
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
students involved in uh livestock uh
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
courses um but at least it it it it it
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
gave a a you know
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
general knowledge is is my understanding
 
04:21:18.349 --> 04:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
and representative Mason may may be able
 
04:21:21.389 --> 04:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
to may know a little bit more about that
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
um but at least it was a it was a start
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
at least what I'm what I'm I guess is
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting at and bringing it up
 
04:21:30.510 --> 04:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
is that there was a facility at the
 
04:21:34.109 --> 04:21:34.119 align:start position:0%
University that we no longer have and to
 
04:21:34.119 --> 04:21:35.189 align:start position:0%
University that we no longer have and to
bring

04:21:35.189 --> 04:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
bring
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
something it may be worth the study
 
04:21:39.790 --> 04:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh time and effort to look
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
into that again and maybe it's not at
 
04:21:44.309 --> 04:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
Una maybe it's somewhere else I I can
 
04:21:46.389 --> 04:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
tell you within Farm Bureau we've had
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
discussions with with uh some folks
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
about uh you know what about there's all
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
these facilities in state supermarkets
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
and such and and using those but the the
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
what you don't what they do at
 
04:22:02.109 --> 04:22:02.119 align:start position:0%
supermarkets is they're bringing in Box
 
04:22:04.510 --> 04:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
Beef they're they're not they're not
 
04:22:06.389 --> 04:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
slaughtering the animal you know live
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
animal at the rail and and and cut of it
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
that way so there's a little bit of a
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
difference but we're again we're trying
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
to we're EXP exploring using all these
 
04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
these pieces and parts and I think
 
04:22:16.750 --> 04:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we're hoping
 
04:22:19.149 --> 04:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
that that the uh a study committee could
 
04:22:22.750 --> 04:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
look at and and actually get the the the
 
04:22:25.149 --> 04:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh educational component whether it's
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
the community colleges the university
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's all at the table
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
together thank you for that clarifying
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative sakas
 
04:22:38.349 --> 04:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I did I'm just
 
04:22:38.359 --> 04:22:40.189 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I did I'm just
curious

04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
curious
 
04:22:44.269 --> 04:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
about if someone was educated to that
 
04:22:48.349 --> 04:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
sort of job what um sort of pay
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
compensation could you see them
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
having well I'm from what I'm told it's
 
04:23:00.750 --> 04:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
the pays pay's good it's it's good
 
04:23:03.630 --> 04:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
um I can't give you numbers but I know
 
04:23:06.189 --> 04:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
we we over uh recently we've had
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussions one of the one of the
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that was part of our work
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
group was was uh worked for hanford's is
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
a meat cutter and he spent his life with
 
04:23:21.109 --> 04:23:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
good thank you it's can I guess to
 
04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit on your question
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
is you and it's it's a fair one because
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
if you I guess you're asking well if if
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
our Slaughter facilities are having
 
04:23:33.630 --> 04:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
trouble getting workers is that part of
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
it is the pay a part of it I think more
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
the issue is it's tough work you're
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
working in a cool climate year round
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
it it's it's it's it's it it's only I
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
guess only certain people are are cut
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
out to I mean you're killing animals
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
regularly I mean it it it takes a a
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
certain individual to do that and
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's some seasonality to the work I'm
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
look I'm going be a little beyond the
 
04:24:01.109 --> 04:24:01.119 align:start position:0%
workers here but for the facilities
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
themselves in in you know in New
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here I mean livestock are
 
04:24:09.790 --> 04:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
ready to go to you know um Farmers want
 
04:24:11.710 --> 04:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
to they don't want to put them feed them
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
through the winter so they're looking at
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
the facilities being open you know we're
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
talking uh uh looking for someplace to
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
take animals on September October and
 
04:24:22.149 --> 04:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
through the winter and so that there's
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
that type of uh of peak but it's it's
 
04:24:29.149 --> 04:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
work okay thank you representative Mason
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
did you have a
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
question I do uh thank you for taking my
 
04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
question um Mr Johnson thank you are you
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
aware of any protocol difference that
 
04:24:44.830 --> 04:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
may happen or regulatory differences
 
04:24:46.590 --> 04:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
that that may appear between a state
 
04:24:49.149 --> 04:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
program and a federal program that would
 
04:24:52.269 --> 04:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
ease ease the um process for anybody to
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
build a less expensive facility or or
 
04:24:56.389 --> 04:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
dive into this
 
04:24:56.399 --> 04:24:57.950 align:start position:0%
dive into this
business

04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
um no no I'm not and and recently one of
 
04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
our our members who who was on our in
 
04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
our our LifeStar work group that's
 
04:25:11.109 --> 04:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
looked at this issue uh he was he was on
 
04:25:14.070 --> 04:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
a a a couple of webinars with with folks
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
out in Wisconsin where they do have a
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
state meet inspection program and they
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
were saying out there that they found
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
the federal inspectors easier to deal
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
with than they did the state inspectors
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
and and I think we had initially thought
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
when we first looked at this have been
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
looking at this that it might be the
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
other way around because of you know
 
04:25:33.309 --> 04:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
just the dealing with the the state
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy versus the federal where
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's a lot closer and you know the
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
players and and you know they're at a at
 
04:25:41.309 --> 04:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
a more local level and and least in
 
04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin they weren't was finding that
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
to be the
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
case thank you and I can I can add one
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
one uh slightly similar thing is uh
 
04:25:55.750 --> 04:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
recently in the in the uh pandemic pass
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh package that that the uh the
 
04:26:01.590 --> 04:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
president signed into law uh late late
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
December just before the new year there
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
there was a there's monies in that to
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
provide up to $100,000 grants for Uh
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
custom exempt facilities to upgrade uh
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
to to Federal level and USG is currently
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
working through the rules making process
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
to determine how they're going to
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
distribute that but there there's I want
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
to say was f um something like $50
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
million uh going towards a $100,000
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
Grant so it's a good chunk of money and
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
and that may entice a facility or two a
 
04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
custom exempt facility or two in New
 
04:26:43.269 --> 04:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to to uh upgrade
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
grade as well as potentially some some
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
facilities in our border states which
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
our our livestock folks do
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
use and there's also been efforts uh and
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
um there are bills in in Congress now
 
04:27:02.189 --> 04:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
that would uh allow State
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
inspected uh meat to be sold uh
 
04:27:08.469 --> 04:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
federally it would go right now you can
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
only sell interest state within the
 
04:27:11.429 --> 04:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
state it would allow State inspecting
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
meets to be sold
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh to in other states how would that
 
04:27:17.710 --> 04:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
help us in New Hampshire if we don't
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
have see we don't have state inspected
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
facilities well like I said our
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
producers are using facilities in uh
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
with uh in ver State inspector
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
facilities in Vermont in Maine and then
 
04:27:30.030 --> 04:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
if if the meat were if the animals were
 
04:27:31.149 --> 04:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
brought there then the meat could be
 
04:27:31.159 --> 04:27:34.030 align:start position:0%
brought there then the meat could be
sold

04:27:34.030 --> 04:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions all right uh thank you Rob and

04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%

of I'm here today to introduce House
 
04:29:34.800 --> 04:29:36.469 align:start position:0%
of I'm here today to introduce House
Bill

04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
367 so this bill is one that we had last
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
year in in committee and we passed
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at the same language
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
again this year
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
but uh so basically what it would do is
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
it uh further clarifies in
 
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
4378 uh section one that it will add the
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
name and address of the issuing
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarian this is more of a a
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
housekeeping thing that needs to occur
 
04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
we felt it would further help identify
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
the the uh Health the uh yeah the person
 
04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's giving out the health certific
 
04:30:14.590 --> 04:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
get in and who the animal owner
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
is the second thing that it does is it
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
works on the uh
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
43784 which deals with the quarantine
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
section for animals that come into the
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
state that will be
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
transferred so the concern we had was
 
04:30:33.109 --> 04:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
that there's many uh different viruses
 
04:30:34.990 --> 04:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
and and different diseases that won't
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
manifest and show themselves within 48
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
hours so that was the concern when we
 
04:30:41.469 --> 04:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
were looking at this had several
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
meetings with uh this the state
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and and the Commissioner of
 
04:30:48.189 --> 04:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and we talked about exactly
 
04:30:50.109 --> 04:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
what the right time frame would be
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
kicked around several different uh dates
 
04:30:54.670 --> 04:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
as different diseases have different
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
times that it takes to to
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
manifest and plus we wanted to look at
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh just further defining that there was
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
no contact with non- quarantined
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
animals and that uh animals on the
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
premises shall receive a uh health
 
04:31:10.750 --> 04:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
certificate from the licensed
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian before being being offered
 
04:31:15.229 --> 04:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
for transfer so I have some concerns
 
04:31:17.469 --> 04:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
that we may not have the exact time
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
quite right on this yet so we we'll hear
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
testimony on this but I think in the end
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask that the committee will
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
retain this bill so that we can further
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
work on it because we are so short on
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
time this spring in doing our bills and
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
I I think we need to look a little bit
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
further on this so with that I'm gonna
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'll open up to any questions from the
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee but I will just tell you we've
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
got a couple of folks testifying behind
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
me they have some very good uh
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
information on this bill and and good
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
user knowledge within the area so the
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
technical questions I would ask you to
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.800 --> 04:31:52.790 align:start position:0%

see any questions from committee yes
representative

04:31:59.710 --> 04:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
k for taking my question thank you
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
representa um just you mentioned that
 
04:32:09.389 --> 04:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
you're not sure if you have the timing
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
the the days right that understanding
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
and what is concern with that yeah so
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
we've got seven days in here now there
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
there are some diseases that take longer
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
and there are some diseases that would
 
04:32:24.750 --> 04:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
show quicker and plus the seven days has
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
been concern raised that this might put
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
a significant burden on um on some of
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
the shelters when they were transferring
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
so I'd like the opportunity to really
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
look at this and make sure we get it
 
04:32:37.850 --> 04:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.860 --> 04:32:40.109 align:start position:0%

members okay seeing
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
none uh I see that we have a Cody
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh we have also to speak on
 
04:33:09.869 --> 04:33:09.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
obber good afternoon this is good
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you madam chair members
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
of the committee this is Stacy oer on
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
behalf of the American Kennel Club I'm
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
the legislative analyst here in New
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
England and wanted to express our
 
04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
support for House Bill
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
367 and share uh just some background
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
information with regard to the increased
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
risk of dogs being imported um into the
 
04:33:40.429 --> 04:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
country there Americans love their dogs
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
and there's high demand for dog dogs
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
that um currently there's higher demand
 
04:33:50.349 --> 04:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
than dogs available and what AKC has
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
observed is that more and more there are
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
rescue organizations that are importing
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
dogs from outside of the country into
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
the United States I mentioned earlier
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
this morning for instance in 2019 dogs
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
coming from Egypt that had uh rabies and
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
therefore the CDC issuing a ban on
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
importing dogs
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
uh from Egypt for the time being but
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
basically we've seen in recent years not
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
only uh that RAB case but also canine
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
influenza and distemper have been
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
carried into the US by dogs that are
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
being imported and um the rescue groups
 
04:34:35.230 --> 04:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
are sourcing these dogs to shelters uh
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
in in the United States and some of them
 
04:34:39.470 --> 04:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
are coming in without basic veterinarian
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
checks or valid Health certificates so I
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to acknowledge that the American
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club in partnership with um the
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
American Veterinary Medical Association
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
has filed last May on the federal level
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Healthy dog importation act which
 
04:35:03.310 --> 04:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
would look to address this issue um and
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that chairman Pearl is
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct if you look up the
 
04:35:11.230 --> 04:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
incubation period for instance of some
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the common illnesses that dogs can
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
carry that are very infectious um it
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
might vary in terms of a dog showing
 
04:35:23.949 --> 04:35:23.959 align:start position:0%
clinical signs of for instance canine
 
04:35:28.949 --> 04:35:28.959 align:start position:0%
parvo virus usually um they will become
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
ill within six to 10 days after an
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
exposure and parvo is not unfortunately
 
04:35:37.949 --> 04:35:37.959 align:start position:0%
an uncommon uh virus that we see dogs
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
contract especially when being
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
transported um secondly canine disp
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
distemper incubation period uh is one to
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
four weeks and dog infections will take
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
up to five days prior to any clinical
 
04:35:56.349 --> 04:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
signs uh being shown um the last one
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
I'll mention is
 
04:36:01.590 --> 04:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
leptospirosis which is found in the soil
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
and natural water sources and it has an
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
incubation period usually of 5 to 14
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
days so I wanted just to acknowledge
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the sourcing of rescue dogs into
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
the country from foreign countries that
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
have very different rules um than the
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
United States has and we have observed
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
even uh some fraudulent Health
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
certificates for instance being used on
 
04:36:28.510 --> 04:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
bringing some dogs into the United
 
04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
States which is why we support this bill
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.429 --> 04:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
move to expand that uh isolation
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
quarantine period from 48 hours which is
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.080 --> 04:36:52.029 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions from
 
04:36:55.039 --> 04:36:56.709 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions from
committee

04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
members I actually have a
 
04:37:03.629 --> 04:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
question um so miss obber thank you very
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
much for coming to testify today um I'm
 
04:37:08.910 --> 04:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
interested to know you mentioned a
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal law that may be coming or is
 
04:37:13.600 --> 04:37:14.709 align:start position:0%
federal law that may be coming or is
being

04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
considered can you see
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
that yes I'm I I'm wondering if any of
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
that uh proposed legislation May
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
conflict with this particular bill that
 
04:37:26.799 --> 04:37:28.230 align:start position:0%
conflict with this particular bill that
we're

04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
proposing I don't believe it would uh
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
the Healthy dog importation Act is
 
04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that was filed in Congress
 
04:37:39.629 --> 04:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
last May and it's been refiled for
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
consideration this session on the
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
Federal level in response to some of
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
these gaps on animals being transported
 
04:37:51.150 --> 04:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
dogs specifically into the country and
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
some of them are coming without basic
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
Veterinary checks or valid Health
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
certificates um so that Transportation
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
process in and of itself could expose a
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
dog to one of these highly contagious
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases and I don't believe
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
strengthening the federal law would
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
minimize the need to still have that
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
period to observe a dog um prior to
 
04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
placing it in a new home or a foster
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
home okay thank you very much for that
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I have representative
 
04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
Bixby uh would mad ask a question uh
 
04:38:35.709 --> 04:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Madam
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh Miss Ober um I was
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are um
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
serological tests that could be done to
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
detect parvo or distemper or other uh
 
04:38:51.869 --> 04:38:51.879 align:start position:0%
diseases of concern uh that might make
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
it make it possible to have a shorter
 
04:38:54.160 --> 04:38:56.390 align:start position:0%
it make it possible to have a shorter
quarantine

04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
quarantine
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
time I would defer to Dr Crawford on
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
that question I'm not an expert or you
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
know a veterinarian in terms of having a
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
background in that area so I don't want
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
to speak out of turn but thank you for
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
the question repres resentative I think
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
it's an important one uh whereas we
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
heard this morning some testimony noting
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
that antibody testing for some of these
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
other infectious canine diseases may
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
have been approved you know for
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not the antibody
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
animal okay thank you um representative
 
04:39:39.550 --> 04:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
Balden you had a question thank you
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you Miss over for
 
04:39:44.110 --> 04:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in your testimony
 
04:39:46.350 --> 04:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that dogs are being
 
04:39:49.030 --> 04:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
imported from other countries um but I
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
also know that that many people are
 
04:39:53.788 --> 04:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
buying Dogs online which come from other
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
states in the US often those dogs are
 
04:39:58.830 --> 04:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
delivered to a Meetup spot just outside
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
our state borders by large 18 wheelers
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
do you know any statistics um on how
 
04:40:06.670 --> 04:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
many dogs come into our state in this
 
04:40:08.788 --> 04:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
manner and do we often see these health
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
issues in these animals
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
I think you're right it's a growing
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
concern quite honestly that there's a
 
04:40:19.150 --> 04:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
circumvention of even the requirement to
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
isolate and quarantine dogs um some
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
states have stronger Provisions than
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
others and it seems that those states
 
04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
that don't have a solid uh framework in
 
04:40:32.240 --> 04:40:34.270 align:start position:0%
that don't have a solid uh framework in
place

04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh states that are adjacent will see
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
that kind of you know tractor trailer
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
weekly delivery of dogs uh from out of
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
state and um a request that anyone
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
looking to rehome a dog meet in a
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
parking lot and um I have looked at for
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
instance uh consumer complaints in the
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts uh from
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
individuals who have tried to buy a dog
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
online from out of state or outside of
 
04:41:05.788 --> 04:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
the country and unfortunately some have
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
been victim of uh fraud where money was
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
collected and no dog appeared or if a
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
dog appeared uh it was very ill uh when
 
04:41:19.628 --> 04:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
it was received so I I think you're
 
04:41:23.948 --> 04:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
concern uh representative Balden you
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
have a followup thank you madam chair
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you M over for taking my
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
followup do you have any concern um that
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
strengthening or or rather increasing
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
the um the quarantine period might lead
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
to more animals coming com in in this
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
manner and I'm I'm asking that because
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
my assumption is that the reason they're
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
coming in that way is because the people
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
selling those animals want to get around
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
quarantine I I think it really goes to
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
having the appropriate resources to
 
04:42:03.430 --> 04:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforce the law and and that's where the
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
focus should be um you know if there is
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
a channel of communication when
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
individuals might see that type of
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
activity and a way to report it to in
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the Department of
 
04:42:17.390 --> 04:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
Agriculture so there can be a followup I
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
think um it's a matter of having the
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
requisite resources to ensure everyone's
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
complying with New Hampshire's
 
04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you thank you and um
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
representative um Mason you had a
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair for
 
04:42:37.628 --> 04:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question mrar thank you
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah as I'm reading this I mean this
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
applies to state borders so as I read it
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just International dogs that
 
04:42:49.390 --> 04:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
come in but it's dogs coming in from
 
04:42:51.150 --> 04:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
other states as well is that how you see
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
this Miss Ober that it would be all all
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
dogs coming into the state I do and you
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
know the reason that I reflected on dogs
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
coming from outside of the state is that
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
um what comes across my desk is articles
 
04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
of rescue organizations that are
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
shipping dogs from out of the country
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps into a Southern state and
 
04:43:15.788 --> 04:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
sourcing those dogs up to shelters that
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
are in the northeast or the Northwest
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
where the demand for dogs is quite high
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
so there's really a um you know a whole
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
circuit if you will of how to uh get
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
more dogs bring them into this country
 
04:43:33.788 --> 04:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
and then move them for placement in the
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
Northeast where we have a culture of
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
wanting to adopt and and care for a dog
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
that's in need of a home
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
um that sentiment is quite strong here
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
and um not only are these dogs that
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
might be Strays for instance down south
 
04:43:52.030 --> 04:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
some of the southern states have done an
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
improved job with their spay and neuter
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh programs and because of it
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
some of the rescue groups have begun
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
transporting dogs from outside of the
 
04:44:05.788 --> 04:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
country to meet the demand a followup if
 
04:44:09.390 --> 04:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
I may M Madam CH go ahead
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that would also
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
apply as this has uh been added that a
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
person that goes say we a small state
 
04:44:21.750 --> 04:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
but a person that goes down to a breeder
 
04:44:21.760 --> 04:44:22.430 align:start position:0%
but a person that goes down to a breeder
in

04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts buys a puppy for a stock
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
dog or purebred dog for himself or 4
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
project whatever uh comes back into New
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with that dog as you as you
 
04:44:36.670 --> 04:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
see this that person would have to give
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
that dog up for seven days to be held
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere to comply with the law no
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
because that dog would that puppy would
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
come with a Veterinary record and uh the
 
04:44:50.670 --> 04:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
the purchaser would have all of the
 
04:44:52.990 --> 04:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
information around vaccinations and
 
04:44:56.430 --> 04:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
whatnot and because it was bred locally
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
and wasn't exposed through some
 
04:45:01.390 --> 04:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation channels whether that be
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
on an airplane coming into the country
 
04:45:06.750 --> 04:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
and then a holding area for instance
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere before being then transported
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
either by
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
or um some other vehicle with a large
 
04:45:18.270 --> 04:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
number of other unrelated dogs to get to
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
the Final Destination that is typically
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
where the risk of infectious disease
 
04:45:24.200 --> 04:45:26.150 align:start position:0%
where the risk of infectious disease
transmission

04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
occurs thank
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
you representative hola you had a
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh chair and
 
04:45:35.550 --> 04:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm not
 
04:45:37.110 --> 04:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
sure if you can if you can answer this
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
or not but I'm just wondering if the um
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
adding the days to the do you know if it
 
04:45:44.830 --> 04:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's any unintended consequences that
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
makes cannibals more vulnerable to you
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
know any kind of euthanasia concerns
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
crowding at shelters things like
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
that I don't have experience managing a
 
04:45:59.948 --> 04:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
shelter I know last session when this
 
04:46:02.430 --> 04:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
committee heard this bill there were
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
individuals that noted they were limited
 
04:46:10.110 --> 04:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
with space and um felt as though if they
 
04:46:13.030 --> 04:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
had to is ol at dogs for longer than 48
 
04:46:15.750 --> 04:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
hours it would reduce the number of dogs
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
they could accept for transfer and
 
04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
rehoming okay thank
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
members don't see
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
any so with that I will close this
 
04:46:39.390 --> 04:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh oh is anybody else want
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
to testify oh I see some hands up okay
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
um let's bring Nancy Holmes up
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
please hello say the unmute work did it
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
yeah there you are okay great thank you
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
U I've been listening carefully to the
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony and the questions on this
 
04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm all in favor of this going
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
through um even if the time might need
 
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
to be increased at some point in the
 
04:47:10.868 --> 04:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
future I think the protections uh given
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
over the next year would be um worth
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
putting it
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
through um but I think we've all had
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much drummed into our brains that
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
14 days is a good quarantine period
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
given the last year of of of
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um the the uh seven days is
 
04:47:33.948 --> 04:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
however better than 48 hours 48 hours is
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
just long enough for you to put a sick
 
04:47:38.548 --> 04:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
animal in a new home that's my feelings
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
on it um one of the diseases mentioned
 
04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
is distemper and that can go into
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
Wildlife too I believe that this bill is
 
04:47:50.030 --> 04:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
intended only to impact those dogs
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
brought into the state for transfer not
 
04:47:55.470 --> 04:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
you're an individual person's um
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
bringing a dog in for addition to their
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
home but for dogs that are intended for
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
transfer um the other thing is that
 
04:48:07.230 --> 04:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
question about tighter tests was was um
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
a good one except that one of the things
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
we did not cover this morning is the
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
fact you can have a high tighter because
 
04:48:16.110 --> 04:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
you're sick not just because you've had
 
04:48:18.990 --> 04:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
a vaccine so a high titer might actually
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
indicate a dog is ill with a disease and
 
04:48:23.788 --> 04:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
is trying to fight it off rather than
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
that a dog is immune to the disease um
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
so these I think are important things I
 
04:48:31.708 --> 04:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
understand wanting to get it right but I
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
think in terms of transition for pet
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
stores and shelters um or for any
 
04:48:38.910 --> 04:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
brokers who bring animals in for resale
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
and into the state I think that going
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
from 48 hours to seven days and then if
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
need be upping it to 14 if seven days
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
isn't sufficient to quell any um
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
outbreaks that occur in that time period
 
04:48:58.110 --> 04:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
um I I think it would be easier for
 
04:49:00.030 --> 04:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
everybody concerned if he started out
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
with a lower than the optimum number of
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
days um as far as it being costly for
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
people um so far as I've seen uh every
 
04:49:12.990 --> 04:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
business I've seen including shelters
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
and pet stores the cost is borne by the
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
purchaser not by the person selling the
 
04:49:20.830 --> 04:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
animal they may have to initially Pony
 
04:49:22.708 --> 04:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
up the money but it just goes into what
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
they charge to get the animal into a new
 
04:49:28.548 --> 04:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
home um so I think that the cost thing
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
is is a a temporary issue and would only
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
really be significant if the animal
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
never sold um there is some issue with
 
04:49:39.310 --> 04:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
some types of dogs where the longer
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're held in a shelter
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
situation um the poorer they do um I
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
think one of the breeds that's really
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
well known for that is is the Pitbull
 
04:49:50.430 --> 04:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
breed they get frustrated and agitated
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
and more difficult to handle the longer
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
they are in um a a cage situation but I
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that is um normally
 
04:50:00.990 --> 04:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
considered to be a weak because many
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
shelters and pounds when they act as
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
pounds um keep dogs for seven to 10 days
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
before they are allowed to be adopted
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
out as a you know from having been a
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
found or stray animal um so I think
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
overall the bills of stands is a good
 
04:50:21.868 --> 04:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
step forward um and in helping make sure
 
04:50:24.430 --> 04:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't end up spreading diseases
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
through our local population of animals
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
be they domestic or Wild by making sure
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
that there is time enough to determine
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
if the animal that's been imported for
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
sale is going to pass an illness along
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:50:43.470 --> 04:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Holmes is there any
 
04:50:48.070 --> 04:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
Holmes seeing
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
Richardson hello can can you hear me yes
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
we can thank you very much thank you for
 
04:51:07.110 --> 04:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
letting me speak I did I did send you
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
guys a testimony last night because I
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if my connection would be
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
solid enough to to speak but it seems to
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
be doing okay so hopefully it'll stick
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to bring up a couple
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
points uh
 
04:51:25.230 --> 04:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh the one of them is that uh in the
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
news today down in Boston they also have
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
a 48 hour quarantine they have in the
 
04:51:31.230 --> 04:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
news they have a couple puppies that
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
came up to a shelter and they came up
 
04:51:37.548 --> 04:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
and they ended up having parvo and had
 
04:51:39.788 --> 04:51:39.798 align:start position:0%
to stay at the shelter for a while so it
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
it is still coming up with with local
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
dogs um the the one thing I wanted to do
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
is to read you my letter from my
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who wrote this to you guys
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
last year when this first came out he is
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
in Claremont New Hampshire there's as
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
one of the Reps mentioned earlier
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's a big tractor trailer that comes
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
up regularly and dumps Out quote unquote
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
rescues from down south to Res to other
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
rescues and to homes in Springfield
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont and he gets a lot of these
 
04:52:16.270 --> 04:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
puppies in with parvo and other diseases
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
shortly after they've been adopted um
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
and it's uh Claremont animal hospital
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the letter is signed by all the Vets
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
there and it says to whom it may concern
 
04:52:29.470 --> 04:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
a very nearly Universal recommendation
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
in veterinary medicine is to isolate new
 
04:52:34.030 --> 04:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
arrivals from Resident populations of
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
animals for a minimum of 10 days prior
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
to exposure of the newly arrived animals
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the resident animals this applies to
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
all species poultry Bine equine porcine
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
chamid ovine and
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
caprine and and he's meaning dogs and
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
cats as well uh this quarantine allows
 
04:52:55.470 --> 04:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
time to identify any illnesses or
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
contagious or infective disease and
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
usually decreases the potential or
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
spread of disease throughout a
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
population this recommendation applies
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
just as much to dogs and cats brought
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
from out of state to our area our
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
practice has seen pets brought in as
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
quote quote rescues with upper
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
respiratory diseases parva virus
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
intestinal diseases scabies demodicosis
 
04:53:20.670 --> 04:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
and heartworm as well as behavioral
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
issues we deem a period of quarantining
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
and assessment by qualified
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
professionals to be very important in
 
04:53:28.830 --> 04:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining the best possible health and
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
well-being of all
 
04:53:34.548 --> 04:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
patients uh that's his letter um and I I
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
think the seven days is bare minimum and
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
I understand the shelters are are
 
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
complaining because right now as the law
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
states they have to be quarantined at a
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
veterinary hospital I think we could get
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
past that by simply saying that they had
 
04:53:54.190 --> 04:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
to be quarantined at a facility and that
 
04:53:55.948 --> 04:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
could be a boarding kenel or whatnot I
 
04:53:59.230 --> 04:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
used to manage a boarding kennel for 11
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
years and we would we would hold dogs
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
for rescues for 14 days when they came
 
04:54:07.230 --> 04:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
in from other out of state before there
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
was a law that said that um and we were
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
just A Boarding Kennel we just kept them
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
in a section where other dogs weren't so
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
that would be a cost saving method
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
instead of having to house the animals
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
in a Veterinary quarantine which is very
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
expensive and that's it I don't want to
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
take up too much time thank you Miss
 
04:54:30.510 --> 04:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
Richardson I just wanted to ask just for
 
04:54:33.070 --> 04:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
clarification for the record too where
 
04:54:35.110 --> 04:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
you're calling from and are you
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
representing yourself or organization
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm in Springfield New Hampshire and I'm
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
presenting myself I've been a dog
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
trainer since the 80s and I managed uh
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
the very large boarding kennel which was
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
licensed as an animal shelter for 11
 
04:54:56.110 --> 04:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
years thank you for that got questions
 
04:54:56.120 --> 04:55:10.670 align:start position:0%
years thank you for that got questions
from

04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.708 --> 04:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
us hi um I am calling from Massachusetts
 
04:55:25.708 --> 04:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
and I know that I'm not new New
 
04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but I I'm about to start
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
the process of becoming a licensed
 
04:55:35.548 --> 04:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
rescue in New Hampshire because um our
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
current operations are in just below the
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
border so it obvious viously it makes
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
sense to we are we've been a registered
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
rescue in the state of Massachusetts for
 
04:55:48.430 --> 04:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
10 years so we are going to try and
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
apply for New Hampshire and if this goes
 
04:55:53.350 --> 04:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
through then obviously it's going to be
 
04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's not going to be conducive
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
to running any sort of operations what I
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out to any
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives who are going to be
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
voting on this is a couple of things um
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
you as if you guys don't know there's
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
always been a battle there's always been
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
a contentious relationship between the
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
AKC and rescues always always always all
 
04:56:17.788 --> 04:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
you have to do is spend five minutes of
 
04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
your day I'm not going to sit here and
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
tell you the millions of statistics and
 
04:56:26.470 --> 04:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
the cases of AKC registered breeders in
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that have sold unscrupulous
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
breeders who have sold puppies to
 
04:56:35.628 --> 04:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts residents that have died
 
04:56:38.190 --> 04:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
of parvo and because guess who deals
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
with them I do once their puppy has died
 
04:56:43.390 --> 04:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
of parvo they decide to go to the rescue
 
04:56:46.830 --> 04:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
route so breeders are J of have
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
committed violations and agrees greous
 
04:56:52.350 --> 04:56:52.360 align:start position:0%
acts just as much as all of the AKC that
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
is saying that rescuees du as well um

04:58:13.150 --> 04:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
something to say uh all we want to do is
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people have the best
 
04:58:18.670 --> 04:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
chance of getting a healthy pet because
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you it really hurts people
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
when they get an animal that they've
 
04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
spent all kinds of money on excuse me I
 
04:58:28.548 --> 04:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
get choked up about this all kinds of
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
money on and they love it and it dies
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
within a week or two because nobody who
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
is bringing it in to sell to them took
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
the time to make sure absolutely sure
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
that the animal they were selling was
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
unhealthy um you know that was healthy
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
to go to a new home um it you know it's
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
a Terri it's a terrible thing it's
 
04:58:50.430 --> 04:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
really hard on like a rescue or a
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
shelter or even a pet store if one of
 
04:58:54.628 --> 04:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
the animals they bring in dies but
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
nowhere near as hard as it is on the
 
04:58:58.990 --> 04:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate consumer who loses a family
 
04:59:01.150 --> 04:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
member out of it and that's all I have
 
04:59:03.430 --> 04:59:03.440 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:59:43.470 --> 04:59:43.480 align:start position:0%

okay we are going to open up the hearing
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%

signed up to speak I'm going to uh I'm
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
just going to ask everyone to try to
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
stick to three minutes because we have
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work after this hearing
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
for the committee to do as well so if we
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
can keep this reasonable I would uh the
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
committee would appreciate it uh so I
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
will bring up the prime sponsor Karen
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
apologies um good afternoon um chair
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
Pearl and committee members just making
 
05:00:36.670 --> 05:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
sure you can hear me we can go ahead
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you great thank you
 
05:00:42.190 --> 05:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
very much um for the record my name is
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh Karen Eble and I represent marac
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
District number five which is New London
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
hb413 which would establish a solid
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
waste working group for uh Solid Waste
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
Management planning and relative to
 
05:01:07.150 --> 05:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
compost um so
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
413 uh would create the working group to
 
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
be convened by Dees in support of its
 
05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste planning efforts it would
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
put a deadline on updating and
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
promulgation of the state's uh
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
composting regulations which are long
 
05:01:24.948 --> 05:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
overdue the bill is the combination of
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
two virtually identical bills that were
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
recommended unanimously for p uh passage
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
by this committee and pass the house on
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar by Voice vote the
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
journey was similar in the Senate but
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
because of covid it got rolled they got
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
rolled into the Omnibus and
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
administrative uh Bill uh hb1 1234 and
 
05:01:48.470 --> 05:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was veto by the governor um the
 
05:01:51.030 --> 05:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
delay in passage is really unfortunate
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
because those bills uh dealt with issues
 
05:01:55.830 --> 05:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
of great importance to our state to our
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities businesses and citizens
 
05:02:01.548 --> 05:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
and if you review the co co-sponsor list
 
05:02:03.750 --> 05:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's a strongly supported by
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
partisan bill um as you'll recall in
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
2019 China decided to stop taking solid
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
waste from the United States where it
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
had been recycled particularly Plastics
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
and mixed paper this really put a strain
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
on our cities and towns and on their
 
05:02:20.548 --> 05:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
pocketbooks and because of that I
 
05:02:22.270 --> 05:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
introduced HB
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
617 and it created a study committee on
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
solid waste and former representative
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
John O Conor was on that committee along
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
with Representatives Megan M Murray and
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters and the committee's
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
goal was to hear from as many
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups as possible public
 
05:02:42.390 --> 05:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
and private landfill operators
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities schools
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
recyclers um state agencies and
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and what followed uh we were
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh amazed at the interest uh it was a
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
really active eight-week study we had 14
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and over 50 stakeholders
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
participated so I um gave you uh a link
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
to the study committee report and if
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
you're new new to this committee um I
 
05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
would really commend it to you for your
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
review because it gives a a quite a good
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
summary of where we are and the various
 
05:03:23.708 --> 05:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste challenges that we have and
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
in my testimony I gave you the link to
 
05:03:29.230 --> 05:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
the committee web page and there's um
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
shareholder submissions or stakeholder
 
05:03:34.830 --> 05:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
submissions minutes and we even had a
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
continuing education session because
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
there was so much interest in the talk
 
05:03:43.110 --> 05:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
IC so one of the things I emailed to you
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
just to uh kind of highlight the
 
05:03:47.788 --> 05:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
situation that we're having is a
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
one-page document that I pulled from our
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
report and it's uh from Dees and it's
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
entitled New Hampshire projected waste
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
disposal need and capacity and if you
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
look at that now or uh at your
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
convenience um in uh 2035 for the
 
05:04:08.510 --> 05:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
current permitting level uh our capacity
 
05:04:10.350 --> 05:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
Is Not Great it it just basically
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
plummets so I think um we clearly have a
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
problem on our hands and covid we really
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
were working on this a lot covid stalled
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
our efforts as it did so many and um we
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
have a brewing crisis with our landfill
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
capacity and on top of that we have a
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
very limited capacity at Dees Solid
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
Waste Bureau to deal with more than
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day UH responsibilities due to
 
05:04:42.708 --> 05:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
drastic budget cuts and the problem that
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
creates is that we have to do Advanced
 
05:04:49.548 --> 05:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
planning and uh The de's Limited
 
05:04:53.230 --> 05:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
capacity is really to our detriment and
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to notice uh note that the
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
waste management Council which is the
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
Appellate body for uh the dees Waste
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
Management division um is also supposed
 
05:05:07.788 --> 05:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
to help with strategic planning but
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
given its appell responsibility ities
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the volunteer nature of the board it
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
has almost no time to do that and um I
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
believe you do have a letter in support
 
05:05:21.510 --> 05:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill from um Mr Rudy basil man
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
mans from the waste management Council
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
he's the head of it I was going to read
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
it into the record for him but since uh
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're tight on time I you have it so um
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it there I'm I was um
 
05:05:38.548 --> 05:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
and I would say that our idea is to
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
include a member of the Waste Management
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
Council on this task
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
force so the recycling study committee
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
made many recommendations but two of the
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
most important was the creation of this
 
05:05:53.350 --> 05:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
um task force to help
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
Dees and the other uh aspect of it uh is
 
05:06:02.430 --> 05:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
to um put a deadline on the promulgation
 
05:06:04.590 --> 05:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
05:06:07.628 --> 05:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
compost uh regulations that Dees is
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to uh bring forth Ward so with
 
05:06:13.470 --> 05:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
a long-term Solid Waste planning in the
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
offing uh Dees really needs assistance
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
with input and problem solving and I
 
05:06:21.390 --> 05:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
just want to be plain here that de's
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Bureau is generally funded
 
05:06:26.430 --> 05:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
it used to have a planning division but
 
05:06:28.670 --> 05:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
because of consistent Bud budget cuts
 
05:06:31.868 --> 05:06:31.878 align:start position:0%
now it doesn't and we have not had a
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
longrange solid waste plan which is
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be produced every six years
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
since 2003 and we desperately need need
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
one other states are working very hard
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
on this in some cases they're
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
instituting specific solid
 
05:06:49.510 --> 05:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
waistbands and in some cases where refu
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
is banned in one state we are the
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
recipients in our landfills and
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermon are two
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
examples because of the interstate
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
commerce clause we cannot ban outof
 
05:07:01.520 --> 05:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
commerce clause we cannot ban outof
State

05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
State
 
05:07:09.070 --> 05:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
wastes um so one obvious way to decrease
 
05:07:10.708 --> 05:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh the amount amount of waste going into
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
our landfills and help with our capacity
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
is to try to limit the amount of food
 
05:07:19.708 --> 05:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
waste it contributes up to 20% of the
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste in weight and it should be
 
05:07:24.948 --> 05:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
composted to the extent possible the
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
study committee uh we on the hearing
 
05:07:30.990 --> 05:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we had on composting we had a very
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
large turnout and I would say it was the
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
thing that was of most interest to um to
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
the well to the committee because we had
 
05:07:42.670 --> 05:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
such a such a turnout and part of it was
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
the regul regulatory structure just
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
really needs to be updated and Dees has
 
05:07:51.390 --> 05:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
struggled to get this done even though
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
it was tasked to do it um originally
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
starting their work was supposed to
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
start in 2015 and it still hasn't gotten
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
done um I believe it can help uh spur a
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
new business and um we really need to do
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
it it'll save municipalities money and
 
05:08:09.200 --> 05:08:10.670 align:start position:0%
it it'll save municipalities money and
um

05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:12.750 --> 05:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
by putting a deadline in here and I've
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
spoken to Dees you know with their
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
prioritization and everything they
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
should be able to get this done and I
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
think it it does need to um to happen so
 
05:08:26.190 --> 05:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
just um that basically concludes my
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I did also send to the
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
committee a suggested Amendment um and
 
05:08:38.190 --> 05:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.190 --> 05:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
0343 and and uh the upshot of that
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment as I explained in my cover
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
note to you um just to provide for some
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
continuity in the in the membership all
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
this does is i' because I've seen it on
 
05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
different boards that I've served on
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful uh an appointed member
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
just serves until they're replaced um
 
05:09:04.548 --> 05:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
and that gives some continuity to the
 
05:09:06.788 --> 05:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
body so that's the first section of the
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
amendment but really more importantly um
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
in talking with uh Dees the deadlines
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
that were in the original Bill really
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
didn't give Dees an opportunity to do
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
anything meaningful they were just so
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
tight so um I moved out the
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting to occur no later
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
than November 1st 2021 instead of 60
 
05:09:37.270 --> 05:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
days after um after the bill uh passage
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
should it pass and then I'm moved out
 
05:09:43.390 --> 05:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
the date of the initial um reporting
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
2022 because I mean it's just it was It
 
05:09:52.990 --> 05:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
was kind of ridiculous to ask them to do
 
05:09:56.670 --> 05:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
a report maybe two months after they uh
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
originally convened and this will
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
provide some much more meaningful um
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
input opportunity for the task force and
 
05:10:08.350 --> 05:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
I made it a five-year task force so
 
05:10:10.948 --> 05:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
that's what and it automatically uh
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
would repeal November 1st 2026 so that's
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
what the amendment
 
05:10:19.548 --> 05:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
provides and just in conclusion I just
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to say Dees does a fantastic job
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
it has ever dwindling
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
resources and um it was really important
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
one of the top recommendations by our
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
recycling committee that we put together
 
05:10:37.788 --> 05:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
a working group to uh bolster de de's
 
05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
planning capacity to facilitate its
 
05:10:43.270 --> 05:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholder um
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
participation and also uh if we just get
 
05:10:49.230 --> 05:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
these composting regulations done it
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
should create more business and cost
 
05:10:54.430 --> 05:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
savings I urge passage of this important
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm happy to ask any questions
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you representative I guess
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
you can ask us too I wouldn't dream of
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
it all right uh representative South AAS
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
has a question for you sure hi um
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative AEL um nice to hear from
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
you again I um I'm just curious about
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
this interstate commerce clause um is
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
there a ratio of how much outof State
 
05:11:27.548 --> 05:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
garbage we have to accept um because
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
we're a very small state and next to Big
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
States so I'm just wondering about who
 
05:11:37.470 --> 05:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
decides how much garbage comes in well
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm I can answer in in summary but
 
05:11:43.628 --> 05:11:43.638 align:start position:0%
the person who really knows the answer
 
05:11:47.310 --> 05:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
the best to that question is um Mike nor
 
05:11:49.510 --> 05:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
who I believe is here to testify from
 
05:11:52.990 --> 05:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
Dees but the short answer is that we
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
cannot ban outof State West uh waste
 
05:11:59.510 --> 05:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
under the um interstate commerce clause
 
05:12:01.708 --> 05:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
however as part of the permitting
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
process the dees looks at our needs and
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
um sort of assesses what the amount of
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
capacity that needs to be reserved for
 
05:12:16.150 --> 05:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
our state um under certain circumstances
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
and he can give you more detail um what
 
05:12:22.830 --> 05:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to say in addition to the
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause from a
 
05:12:25.040 --> 05:12:26.350 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause from a
capacity

05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint um local control local
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
regulations um also have an influence on
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
permitting so on the creation or
 
05:12:39.708 --> 05:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
expansion of a new landfill
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
you really also have to get the approval
 
05:12:46.830 --> 05:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the uh local Town
 
05:12:49.070 --> 05:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
boards thank you thank you
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%

representative hello

representative eel uh in New Hampshire I
 
05:13:20.030 --> 05:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
think it's well known that a lot of work
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
is done by volunteers and that the uh
 
05:13:25.230 --> 05:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
state government depends on volunteers
 
05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
to do this work and it seems to me like
 
05:13:30.430 --> 05:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
your bill is promoting that once again
 
05:13:32.788 --> 05:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
that instead of having professionals who
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
are paid in the department uh now we
 
05:13:37.390 --> 05:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
will have a group of volunteers who will
 
05:13:40.110 --> 05:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
be doing this work did your Comm uh when
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
you were drafting this bill did you give
 
05:13:45.390 --> 05:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
any consideration uh to looking at how
 
05:13:48.750 --> 05:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
the state might go ahead and increase
 
05:13:51.788 --> 05:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
the funding or develop accounts that may
 
05:13:56.670 --> 05:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
be used uh by Dees uh for uh forward
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
planning um well in the recycling
 
05:14:04.350 --> 05:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
committee study report one of the
 
05:14:06.910 --> 05:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations um in addition to just
 
05:14:09.070 --> 05:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
highlighting how desperately under
 
05:14:13.350 --> 05:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
funded the uh Bureau is was that we
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
investigate um adding an additional
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
dollar to the per ton tipping fees and
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
then setting up a grant program that
 
05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
could be utilized um by folks who wanted
 
05:14:31.948 --> 05:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
to develop uh a murf or other
 
05:14:35.310 --> 05:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
methodologies uh to help with uh Solid
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
Waste Management it also um the bill
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
well that was the recommendation
 
05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually there was a bill that came out
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
of it that was tabled due to covid um
 
05:14:49.390 --> 05:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of the bill that was
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
proposed and what was recommended by the
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee was that um tipping fees that
 
05:14:57.788 --> 05:14:57.798 align:start position:0%
were uh paid by
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities those funds would be um
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
returned so we did look at that
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
particular method of um of developing
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
more fun fing and in the study committee
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
report you'll see that
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
virtually I mean at the time the study
 
05:15:19.948 --> 05:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
was did done uh on tipping fees I think
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
something like three quarters of the
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
states in the United States uh have a
 
05:15:27.628 --> 05:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
tipping uh fee added to the regular
 
05:15:30.670 --> 05:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
tipping costs that help uh fund State
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
efforts for planning thank
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Miss e
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative eel for uh the great work
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
you've done and to the uh members of the
 
05:15:49.948 --> 05:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
previous study group for all the all the
 
05:15:52.548 --> 05:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
excellent work on this issue which is so
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
important um I just had a question about
 
05:15:57.470 --> 05:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
some of the deadlines for issuing uh
 
05:15:59.350 --> 05:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
regulations or recommendations that
 
05:16:00.670 --> 05:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
would come out of this
 
05:16:03.270 --> 05:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
bill um there's an
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
interim there's an interim report that
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
is supposed to come out uh I guess in
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
2021 November 2021 would that include
 
05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the uh composting
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
regulations well so um no it wouldn't
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
include the composting regulations
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
because the composting regulations are
 
05:16:24.548 --> 05:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done by September I think
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
it was 30th of
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
2021 um and the amendment that I
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
proposed to the committee was that we
 
05:16:37.150 --> 05:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
have the interim report be um required
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
to be delivered November 3rd 30th
 
05:16:43.590 --> 05:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
2022 and part of the reason there and
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
again Mr nor could talk some more about
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
it but in talking to the
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
department um the actually they're
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get the long-term Solid Waste
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
plan done um and it's due by October
 
05:17:02.430 --> 05:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
2022 and so the thought there is that
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
the task force would be working with the
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
Department as it develops that Solid
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
Waste plan and its first report which
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be due November whatever 30th 2022
 
05:17:19.390 --> 05:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
would append the uh Solid Waste
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
plan okay thank you I have a followup
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
question if I may Mr chair sure go ahead
 
05:17:27.230 --> 05:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is on just a totally unrelated uh
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
issue but uh and we might hear some more
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
of this from other people testifying
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
later but would you consider adding a
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
position on the commission uh to members
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
of uh citizens groups or uh other public
 
05:17:42.628 --> 05:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
interest groups that might have a stake
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
in this issue and have been working on
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
this issue I mean I'm I'm open to what
 
05:17:51.628 --> 05:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
the committee might want to do um you
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
know I I tried to look at all the
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
different stakeholder groups that
 
05:17:59.910 --> 05:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
participated I kept in mind how big the
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
task force was I gave uh Dees some
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
latitude if they wanted to add to it but
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
even if they did add to it I am quite
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
sure knowing them that in the Outreach
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
that they did to stakeholders they'd be
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
sure to get um representation from a
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
variety of groups including the group
 
05:18:20.480 --> 05:18:22.390 align:start position:0%
variety of groups including the group
you

05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned thank
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes thank you uh Mr chair for uh
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you
 
05:18:39.310 --> 05:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
representative eel um I just uh
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
a question getting back to the um the
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill that would have created a sear
 
05:18:47.910 --> 05:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
charge on the Tipping fees do you know
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
if uh a similar bill has been rein uh
 
05:18:54.750 --> 05:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
has been um submitted again for this
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
year uh Senator Waters introduced that
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill last year uh he did not reintroduce
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
it to my knowledge okay thank you but he
 
05:19:07.548 --> 05:19:07.558 align:start position:0%
did just to I'm sorry I'm sorry go ahead
 
05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby just just a a quick
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
note on the um the timeline for the
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
composting the legislation that required
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
that composting was actually passed in
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
2015 right I mentioned yeah yeah and so
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I know that the uh Department had
 
05:19:26.830 --> 05:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
a task force that it was working with
 
05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
but again because they are just
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
unbelievably strained within the
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
department it's made it extremely
 
05:19:36.910 --> 05:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to um to get them
 
05:19:39.150 --> 05:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
done but you know through the study
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
committee process and by putting this
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
deadline on and I mean I I think they
 
05:19:46.350 --> 05:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
feel that they're going to be able to
 
05:19:48.548 --> 05:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
accomplish at this time and it's
 
05:19:51.750 --> 05:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly important for maintaining our
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
capacity Business Development and people
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
just really want to get it done I think
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
it would be a great thing to put the
 
05:20:00.190 --> 05:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
deadline on and move
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
ahead if you if you didn't mind Mr chair
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add on the question of
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
the search charges there there is
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
another bill that's pending in the sen
 
05:20:11.470 --> 05:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
that was vetoed at the same time same
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
time that my other two bills were and
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
that was to um reduce the solid waste
 
05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
reduction goal because there's a goal in
 
05:20:24.430 --> 05:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
149 M That was supposed to be achieved I
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was the year 2000 or
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
what but it's just it really the whole
 
05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
thing needs to be updated and if that
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
passes the Senate which it did before um
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be getting that thank you for the
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
heads up
 
05:20:41.708 --> 05:20:41.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative Aaron has a question
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%

05:20:51.868 --> 05:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
on working group study
 
05:20:53.788 --> 05:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
and as
 
05:20:56.430 --> 05:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
well my question
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
is will
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
any is the working group going to be
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.910 --> 05:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's cutting out did you say
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:18.750 --> 05:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
sighting talk about uh land sighting at
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
all well I think you
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking at the recommendations
 
05:21:29.788 --> 05:21:29.798 align:start position:0%
here and um you know they're looking at
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Disposal landfill capacity I
 
05:21:36.788 --> 05:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
just can't imagine that in the realm of
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh looking at capacity
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't also be talking about
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
citing challenges um I mean let's face
 
05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
it it it's huge and if our current
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
landfills are tapping out um we've got
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
to figure something out I I really I
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
feel like I should mention here too
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
which I did in my cover note you know we
 
05:22:02.350 --> 05:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
have in our Solid Waste reduction um
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
statute a
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of what we're supposed to do
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
to try to um manage our goals and that
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
the top of the hierarchy is Source
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
reduction and then it goes to recycling
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
and reuse composting waste to energy
 
05:22:22.110 --> 05:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
technology um incineration without
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
resource recovery and at the very very
 
05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
bottom is landfilling and of course
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think most of our Solid
 
05:22:33.548 --> 05:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
Waste is ending up in the landfill and
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
um you know we need to harness uh the
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
things that are going into a landfill
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
through Recycling and and reuse and we
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
really need to reduce our um our source
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
sources and I I mean I would just say
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons on the study on the
 
05:22:53.830 --> 05:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
study committee or the task force I put
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in there that that actually
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
uses Goods to reprocess and produce
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
other Goods as something to that so that
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
we can have them in there
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
talking thank you for that thank you
 
05:23:07.200 --> 05:23:08.990 align:start position:0%
talking thank you for that thank you
representative

05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
all right uh I don't see any hands
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
raised so I appreciate your testimony
 
05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
you did a wonderful job highlighting the
 
05:23:16.830 --> 05:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill and we certainly appreciate all the
 
05:23:18.510 --> 05:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
work that you've done on this and and
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
the issue previously thank
 
05:23:24.750 --> 05:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
you all right I'll remind everybody
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
we've got eight more folks that would
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
like to speak so if we can try to keep
 
05:23:30.070 --> 05:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
it to around three minutes and not
 
05:23:33.230 --> 05:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
repeat what uh other testimony has
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
already been previously done would be
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
great I'll call Representative Megan
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
Murray next
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
there honorable colleagues I'm going to
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
keep this extremely short because much
 
05:23:47.708 --> 05:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
was said before me but um you all have
 
05:23:49.150 --> 05:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
received my testimony and one of the
 
05:23:50.670 --> 05:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
things that I just wanted to in
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
particular highlight was that we really
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
do have um with with with specificity to
 
05:23:59.708 --> 05:23:59.718 align:start position:0%
compostable food waste um we really have
 
05:24:02.510 --> 05:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to get that heavy food um
 
05:24:04.910 --> 05:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
food waste out of landfill streams and
 
05:24:06.990 --> 05:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
divert it into compostable into a
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
compostable solution rather than its
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
heavy Mass being hauled at municipality
 
05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
expense and encapsulated um forever in
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
landfills and um I just again as you as
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
you heard the complex nature of um solid
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
waste and recycling in New Hampshire if
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
we are going to adapt and continue to be
 
05:24:29.230 --> 05:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
a forward-thinking um Community where we
 
05:24:31.350 --> 05:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
seek to grow and change uh we also have
 
05:24:32.910 --> 05:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're addressing this
 
05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
need and it it is urgent at this point
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that was brief
 
05:24:44.270 --> 05:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it any questions for
 
05:24:44.280 --> 05:24:46.750 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it any questions for
representative

representative
 
05:24:48.990 --> 05:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
Murray all right not seeing any thank
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%

05:24:51.840 --> 05:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
you I will call uh representative
Suzanne

05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair and U members
 
05:25:04.270 --> 05:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
Suzanne Smith I represent the towns of
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Hein and Holden Grafton County
 
05:25:12.628 --> 05:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
District 8 I will be brief also as
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative eel did such an excellent
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
job um but even back when I was serving
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
on the environment and agriculture
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee 12 years ago Solid Waste was a
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
big issue and composting was a big issue
 
05:25:32.110 --> 05:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
and the EPA estimates that 63.1 million
 
05:25:34.750 --> 05:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
tons of food waste was generated by
 
05:25:36.868 --> 05:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
commercial institutional and residential
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
sectors in 20
 
05:25:44.270 --> 05:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
8 21% of the total solid waste of
 
05:25:47.150 --> 05:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and if we compost more of
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
our food waste it will be a giant step
 
05:25:52.830 --> 05:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
towards reducing the bulk in landfills
 
05:25:55.548 --> 05:25:55.558 align:start position:0%
as well as contributing to healthy soils
 
05:25:58.990 --> 05:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
and and that are so important for
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture so um I'm not going to say
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
much more but uh composting is near and
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
dear to my heart um both for what it
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
does to the soil and what it keeps out
 
05:26:11.310 --> 05:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
of the landfill and so I ask for your
 
05:26:13.470 --> 05:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
support on House Bill
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
413 and thank you very much thank you
 
05:26:19.628 --> 05:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
representative any any questions for
 
05:26:19.638 --> 05:26:22.708 align:start position:0%
representative any any questions for
representative

05:26:22.708 --> 05:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
Smith all right see n we thank you for
 
05:26:25.040 --> 05:26:26.030 align:start position:0%
Smith all right see n we thank you for
your

05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next we'll pull up uh
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
Dees good afternoon uh chairman Pearl
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thanks for the
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity U for the record my name is
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
Michael Nor I'm providing testimony on
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of the solid waste management
 
05:26:48.990 --> 05:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau at
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
Dees and in short Dees supports this
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment that was
 
05:26:59.470 --> 05:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
recommended by uh representative eel um
 
05:27:00.990 --> 05:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
as was discussed at length by
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative eel I won't rehash her
 
05:27:05.708 --> 05:27:05.718 align:start position:0%
discussion but the solid waste and
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
recycling study committee back in 2019
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Unearthed good deal of uh information
 
05:27:14.510 --> 05:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's lots of resources on their
 
05:27:14.520 --> 05:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
there's lots of resources on their
website

05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:27:18.868 --> 05:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
um and you know there's definitely a
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
need for the state to take a more
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
proactive role in Long Range Solid Waste
 
05:27:25.548 --> 05:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
Management planning and addressing the
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
the Myriad Solid Waste issues that face
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
our state and the region and pursuant to
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
149 M um Dees is the the agency
 
05:27:37.070 --> 05:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for solid waste planning and
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
we are required to periodically update
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
the state Solid Waste Management plan
 
05:27:44.590 --> 05:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
however over the last 20 years or so um
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the department has had severe resource
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
deficiencies which has made it difficult
 
05:27:52.590 --> 05:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
for us to uh fulfill you know the solid
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
waste management plan mandate as well as
 
05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
other duties that have gone unmet for a
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
number of years and that's not to say
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
that they aren't important or priorities
 
05:28:02.910 --> 05:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
for us it's just that we have been
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
challenged to be able to address them um
 
05:28:08.510 --> 05:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I also want to note that this bill
 
05:28:12.110 --> 05:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
in developing a uh Solid Waste uh
 
05:28:15.070 --> 05:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder workg group um would be an
 
05:28:18.990 --> 05:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
important tool and helping us to um you
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
know start addressing some of those
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
issues and to you know Advance a
 
05:28:24.750 --> 05:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about updating the solid
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
waste management plan and uh looking at
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
other innovative ways that we can
 
05:28:31.708 --> 05:28:31.718 align:start position:0%
address Solid Waste challenges however
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would not address our resource
 
05:28:38.510 --> 05:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in itself um
 
05:28:40.230 --> 05:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
and I do want to note that other states
 
05:28:43.110 --> 05:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
commonly engage so the state agencies
 
05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
that are overseeing solid waste
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
management in other states they also
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
commonly engage with stakeholder work
 
05:28:51.390 --> 05:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
groups um and advisory groups to help
 
05:28:53.948 --> 05:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
guide policy and development and uh you
 
05:28:56.670 --> 05:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
know identifying priorities for Action
 
05:28:58.430 --> 05:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so this would be something that would
 
05:29:00.430 --> 05:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
you know help us
 
05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
to you know keep in line with that kind
 
05:29:05.788 --> 05:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
of effort um the solid waste and
 
05:29:07.548 --> 05:29:07.558 align:start position:0%
recycling study committee in their
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
report noted that New Hampshire is
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
falling far behind in terms of you know
 
05:29:14.190 --> 05:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
long-term planning and those kinds of
 
05:29:15.868 --> 05:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
activities so this this working group
 
05:29:19.750 --> 05:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be a help in that in that regard
 
05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
um and I just also want to note that
 
05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to composting rules and
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
Adoption of revised administrative rules
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
um as was noted there was the
 
05:29:35.708 --> 05:29:35.718 align:start position:0%
sb251 uh back in 2015 which directed
 
05:29:39.548 --> 05:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
Dees to uh basically clarify
 
05:29:42.990 --> 05:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
requirements for composting of uh meat
 
05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
and dairy food waste uh in 2017 and 2018
 
05:29:50.430 --> 05:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
the department held u a series of
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholder workg group meetings uh to
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
help inform us on making those revisions
 
05:29:56.990 --> 05:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
regrettably however we have not been
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
able to uh you know carry carry through
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
on actually adopting revised regulations
 
05:30:06.510 --> 05:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
to date again because we've been uh you
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
know deficient in terms of our uh
 
05:30:11.070 --> 05:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
resources to to have dedicated resources
 
05:30:14.910 --> 05:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
to do that work um but you know this is
 
05:30:16.990 --> 05:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
something that is definitely a priority
 
05:30:19.548 --> 05:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
um you know we continue to to work on it
 
05:30:22.590 --> 05:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
and to advance that that project um and
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
should HB 413 be an acted into law um
 
05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know we would do everything within
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
our power to be able to meet this
 
05:30:32.910 --> 05:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
September 30th deadline to enact those
 
05:30:35.670 --> 05:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so in summary um we
 
05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
support uh moving forward on stakeholder
 
05:30:41.628 --> 05:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
workg group and we also support u a
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
deadline for September 30th of
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for composting
 
05:30:48.510 --> 05:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
facilities with that I'll stop my
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
comments but if you have any questions
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
for me I might be able to address I'm
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
happy to to take
 
05:30:56.110 --> 05:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
them thank you Mr NK any questions uh
 
05:30:58.948 --> 05:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes uh thank you Mr
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr NK for taking my
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering how many
 
05:31:05.070 --> 05:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
people uh that you have in the solid
 
05:31:05.080 --> 05:31:06.788 align:start position:0%
people uh that you have in the solid
waste

05:31:06.788 --> 05:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
waste
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
division uh currently we
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
have I believe seven full-time seven or
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
eight full-time
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
staff that is down from it's less than
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
half of what it used to
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
be okay thank
 
05:31:27.830 --> 05:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
you all right any other questions for Mr
 
05:31:27.840 --> 05:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
you all right any other questions for Mr

05:32:00.350 --> 05:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
is that the same as Mr John
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
Swan okay then we'll we'll hold off on
 
05:32:08.430 --> 05:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
Mr T Hill um next we have Mark Morgan
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
Lebanon oh Mr Morgan all right we will
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
move to Reagan biset from the national
 
05:32:26.910 --> 05:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
Association thank you chairman Pearl and
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Reagan Binet I'm
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the Northeast
 
05:32:38.910 --> 05:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
resource recovery Association
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we were closely involved with the
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
study committee that representative eel
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
LED in the fall of
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
2019 the Northeast resource recovery
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
Association is a recycling nonprofit and
 
05:32:55.150 --> 05:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
we have worked with municipalities
 
05:32:58.430 --> 05:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire to help them
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
increase their Recycling and reduce
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
their waste for the past 40 years and
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
about 80% of New Hampshire
 
05:33:10.270 --> 05:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities are members of our
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
organization we do not take a position
 
05:33:12.718 --> 05:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
organization we do not take a position
on

05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
hb413 but rather I wanted to share some
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
testimony um regarding our
 
05:33:23.150 --> 05:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
municipality's experience with Recycling
 
05:33:25.230 --> 05:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
and composting as it relates to this
 
05:33:28.750 --> 05:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill and as written hb413 would include
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
one representative from the Northeast
 
05:33:33.310 --> 05:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
resource recovery Association as a
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
member of the solid waste working group
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
and we would welcome the opportunity to
 
05:33:36.878 --> 05:33:40.948 align:start position:0%
and we would welcome the opportunity to
participate

05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:42.990 --> 05:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
I as you've heard from several people
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
improved Solid Waste planning in New
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially for recycling and
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
composting would help
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities save money and conserve
 
05:33:52.878 --> 05:33:54.190 align:start position:0%
municipalities save money and conserve
natural

05:33:54.190 --> 05:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
natural
 
05:33:57.150 --> 05:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
resources the Northeast has the highest
 
05:33:59.628 --> 05:33:59.638 align:start position:0%
cost of disposal of solid waste compared
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
to the entire country and we expect that
 
05:34:05.190 --> 05:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
that cost of landfilling material will
 
05:34:08.430 --> 05:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
only increase over time which will make
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
finding other ways to reduce waste more
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
valuable and um financially important
 
05:34:14.400 --> 05:34:15.830 align:start position:0%
valuable and um financially important
for

05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:34:18.830 --> 05:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities in particular if we are
 
05:34:22.270 --> 05:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
able as a state to update our food scrap
 
05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
composting regulations to address the
 
05:34:26.910 --> 05:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
composting of meat and dairy that would
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
likewise help municipalities save money
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
as well as conserve environmental
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
resources um you heard from
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative eel about the large L
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
amount of food that is landfilled in the
 
05:34:42.310 --> 05:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
United States actually the most recent
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
information from the Environmental
 
05:34:45.510 --> 05:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency from
 
05:34:49.070 --> 05:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
2018 shows that food waste accounts for
 
05:34:52.270 --> 05:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
24% of all the waste by weight that we
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
are disposing uh in landfills as a
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
country and landfilling food scraps is
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
very expensive because food scraps are
 
05:35:02.910 --> 05:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
heavy and communities have to pay by
 
05:35:06.430 --> 05:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
weight to dispose of their trash now the
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
delay in modernizing our composting
 
05:35:10.430 --> 05:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
rules in New
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is been problematic for
 
05:35:16.670 --> 05:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities because many of our
 
05:35:18.670 --> 05:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal members have expressed an
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
interest in having food scrap composting
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
programs but relatively few have done so
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
to date and that is because asking
 
05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
residents to take the cumbersome
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
additional step of separating out meat
 
05:35:35.590 --> 05:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
and dairy from their other food scraps
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
before composting those is a real
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
limitation on the ability for us to have
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
widespread Municipal and commercial food
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
composting in New Hampshire um so for
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
example the town of Hollis has a food
 
05:35:53.548 --> 05:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
scrap composting pilot program um but it
 
05:35:55.708 --> 05:35:55.718 align:start position:0%
does not include meat and dairy I know
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
that um Mark Morgan from Lebanon they
 
05:36:01.548 --> 05:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
are one of the very few municipalities I
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
believe perhaps the only municipality in
 
05:36:06.750 --> 05:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
the state that is composting food scraps
 
05:36:08.910 --> 05:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
including and dairy and that's because
 
05:36:11.270 --> 05:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
they went through a special uh process
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Dees to enable that
 
05:36:15.548 --> 05:36:15.558 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I just want to add
 
05:36:18.910 --> 05:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
is that the delay in Ru making for
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
updating our composting regulations is
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
also discouraging composting businesses
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
from establishing themselves in New
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so for example Mr Fox
 
05:36:30.430 --> 05:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
composting which some of you may know
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
serves a number of municipalities in the
 
05:36:36.190 --> 05:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast they are able to pick up food
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
waste from New Hampshire and then they
 
05:36:41.350 --> 05:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
take it to their facility in Maine and
 
05:36:44.350 --> 05:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
uh reportedly they're they chose to
 
05:36:46.230 --> 05:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
locate in Maine rather than New
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because Maine's composting
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
regulations were more favorable to their
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
business model so I I do see
 
05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
that updating our composting regulations
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
would both benefit our municipalities
 
05:37:03.868 --> 05:37:03.878 align:start position:0%
and would also benefit um you know
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
business options and opportunities in
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
05:37:10.070 --> 05:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you and I am happy to answer
 
05:37:13.150 --> 05:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have very much are
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
there any questions from
 
05:37:18.270 --> 05:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
isbet I represent hola thank you chair
 
05:37:20.190 --> 05:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question can
 
05:37:22.868 --> 05:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
you tell me what is what's the afterlife
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
of composting what is done with the
 
05:37:25.080 --> 05:37:26.990 align:start position:0%
of composting what is done with the
composted

05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
composted
 
05:37:30.270 --> 05:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
material sure so the the ideal use for
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
composted material is that it would get
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
used as uh a soil amendment for Gardens
 
05:37:37.120 --> 05:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
used as uh a soil amendment for Gardens
for

05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
farms for growing new um for growing new
 
05:37:45.868 --> 05:37:45.878 align:start position:0%
plants some compost material is also
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
used as what's called alternate daily
 
05:37:51.070 --> 05:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
cover for landfills landfill active
 
05:37:54.430 --> 05:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
landfills have a requirement to cover up
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the active portions of their landfills
 
05:37:59.390 --> 05:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis and uh I believe if
 
05:38:01.110 --> 05:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
Mark Morgan was available to join us
 
05:38:03.868 --> 05:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
today I'm fairly confident that that's
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
actually what they're doing with their
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
compost in uh the city of Lebanon but
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
the most common is to use it as h a soil
 
05:38:16.750 --> 05:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
amendment sure follow go ahead thank you
 
05:38:19.750 --> 05:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
and um when uh companies uh make this
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
their their business are they supplying
 
05:38:25.868 --> 05:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
to these landfills are they supplying to
 
05:38:28.948 --> 05:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
Farms um can you do you have any
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
information on
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
that I think it varies I I think that
 
05:38:36.150 --> 05:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
they'll look for whatever profitable
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
Outlets they can find for their material
 
05:38:40.708 --> 05:38:40.718 align:start position:0%
so the the highest and best use would be
 
05:38:43.788 --> 05:38:43.798 align:start position:0%
to use composted material for uh for
 
05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
farms and for gardening um a you know a
 
05:38:50.430 --> 05:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
lesser beneficial use would be to use it
 
05:38:52.750 --> 05:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
as landfill cover so I I think that it
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
it varies by company thank
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing them thank
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:11.510 --> 05:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have uh Haley Jones
 
05:39:19.628 --> 05:39:19.638 align:start position:0%

you all right seeing none we will move
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
to uh Henry vou from the Waste
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.110 --> 05:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
hi uh thank you Mr chairman and members
 
05:39:42.430 --> 05:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record my
 
05:39:45.510 --> 05:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
name is Henry veu and I'm here on behalf
 
05:39:48.350 --> 05:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
of Waste Management uh Waste Management
 
05:39:50.830 --> 05:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
the company not the division of Waste
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
Management over at Dees um uh Waste
 
05:39:57.990 --> 05:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
Management uh has the state's largest uh
 
05:39:59.788 --> 05:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
landfill in
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester um we
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
recently um got a prmit uh for the
 
05:40:07.948 --> 05:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
expansion which will
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
extend the life uh of the landfill till
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
2034 uh so in Hampshire communities will
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
have a place at least at
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
Rochester um till 2024 to dispose of H
 
05:40:25.830 --> 05:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste uh we're also in the
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
recycling business uh we have a
 
05:40:32.350 --> 05:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
materials uh recovery facility in b r
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
Mass um so a lot of New Hampshire's
 
05:40:39.310 --> 05:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
recyclable materials uh and up in Bel R
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
um here today just toh support uh the
 
05:40:44.670 --> 05:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
legislation we worked with the
 
05:40:47.230 --> 05:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
representative eel and representative
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
former representative Connor um uh
 
05:40:54.390 --> 05:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
through the last uh task force that met
 
05:40:56.830 --> 05:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh which produced this bill before you
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
today um and we would be happy to work
 
05:41:03.788 --> 05:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
um as a member of the uh working group
 
05:41:06.750 --> 05:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
that this uh legislation would establish
 
05:41:08.910 --> 05:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
and we answer any
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
05:41:11.040 --> 05:41:15.830 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
Mr

05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:18.468 --> 05:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
R seeing none I think we're good thank
 
05:41:22.190 --> 05:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
testimony okay that's all I have on my
 
05:41:26.350 --> 05:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
list so is there anyone else that would
 
05:41:32.548 --> 05:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.510 --> 05:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:50.590 --> 05:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
05:41:52.750 --> 05:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
hello could you please tell us where
 
05:41:54.910 --> 05:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're from and who you representing
 
05:41:56.670 --> 05:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
yeah my name is John Tut Hill I live in
 
05:41:58.948 --> 05:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
aworth New Hampshire former member of
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
the environment and agriculture
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
committee we're dealing with solid waste
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
back then as well 20 years ago um
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
I just I I'm in support of this bill
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
obviously planning is long overdue I
 
05:42:15.310 --> 05:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
would support the suggestion that
 
05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps we broaden a little bit uh the
 
05:42:20.310 --> 05:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
perspective of some of the
 
05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
participants as we continue to hear a
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
year after year about the landfill
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
capacity crisis I think it's pretty
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
clear what we have got is a
 
05:42:31.628 --> 05:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
u a capacity to plan is is more of our
 
05:42:33.788 --> 05:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
problem than the actual
 
05:42:36.468 --> 05:42:36.478 align:start position:0%
landfills um we have continued to Kick
 
05:42:38.910 --> 05:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
the Can down Road year after year decade
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
after decade and I think that's why we
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in the situation we're in
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh I was surprised to hear uh from
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
representative AEL that there is a bill
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
in the Senate this year proposing to
 
05:42:52.510 --> 05:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
reduce uh the state's reduction goals
 
05:42:55.750 --> 05:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
which are about 20 years old um we
 
05:42:57.548 --> 05:42:57.558 align:start position:0%
should in fact at this point be looking
 
05:43:00.350 --> 05:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
at increasing our reduction goals uh an
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
appeal before the waste management
 
05:43:05.190 --> 05:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
Council uh last year I believe uh made
 
05:43:06.750 --> 05:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
it quite clear that the problem isn't
 
05:43:09.628 --> 05:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
the goal so much it is a dispute over
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
how do you account for reduction and
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
this is a problem of not having obtained
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
adquate data over the years in terms of
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
what is being diverted what is being
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
recovered what is being recycled and
 
05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
what is being
 
05:43:21.958 --> 05:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
what is being
disposed

05:43:23.750 --> 05:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
disposed
 
05:43:26.468 --> 05:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of myths the first
 
05:43:30.030 --> 05:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
is the landfill capacity crisis uh which
 
05:43:32.590 --> 05:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
is a manufactured crisis and essentially
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
a failure I think on the part not of
 
05:43:37.510 --> 05:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
Dees uh but over the years failure on
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
the part of the legislature to develop
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsible policies for
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
reducing uh the amount of waste needing
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
to be gen uh disposed of in the state
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
much of which at this point because we
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
are in a privatized system is coming in
 
05:43:55.110 --> 05:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
over uh over the state borders uh that
 
05:43:56.830 --> 05:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
gets us to the second myth which has to
 
05:43:58.310 --> 05:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
do with the international Commerce
 
05:44:00.670 --> 05:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
Clause on the face of it is quite true
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
that it is not possible to regulate a
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
commodity like waste um however there
 
05:44:10.510 --> 05:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
are many ways to uh more responsibly and
 
05:44:10.520 --> 05:44:12.430 align:start position:0%
are many ways to uh more responsibly and
effectively

05:44:12.430 --> 05:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
05:44:15.310 --> 05:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
um control of the materials that are
 
05:44:17.110 --> 05:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
coming into the state and how they will
 
05:44:20.990 --> 05:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
be uh managed and disposal is as we know
 
05:44:22.590 --> 05:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
through the hierarchy the least
 
05:44:25.230 --> 05:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
preferred method the two disposal
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
options being waste incineration with
 
05:44:29.548 --> 05:44:29.558 align:start position:0%
and without energy recovery and
 
05:44:31.868 --> 05:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
landfills uh Vermont has done a very
 
05:44:33.390 --> 05:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
good job I think of limiting the amount
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
of importation into the state Maine has
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
got the mechanisms for doing doing it
 
05:44:39.868 --> 05:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
but for whatever reason has chosen not
 
05:44:41.948 --> 05:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
to Avail itself of those mechanisms but
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
that is certainly something that the
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and this uh
 
05:44:47.430 --> 05:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
working group should be looking at uh
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
that is part of management so I really
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
in closing would just like to emphasize
 
05:44:51.600 --> 05:44:53.230 align:start position:0%
in closing would just like to emphasize
that

05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:44:56.670 --> 05:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
um focusing on zero waste planning I
 
05:44:58.750 --> 05:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
think is the key going forward we're in
 
05:45:00.590 --> 05:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
the 21st century now this is common
 
05:45:04.670 --> 05:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
around the world um even looking within
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
the Northeast but beyond the Northeast
 
05:45:09.070 --> 05:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
and other States and in other countries
 
05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh we we really are still running a very
 
05:45:16.030 --> 05:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
archaic system here um relying very
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
heavily on disposal so I'll wrap up
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
there I know your time is limited and
 
05:45:23.948 --> 05:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
you've got bills to exec but I I really
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
think we need to just you know step back
 
05:45:29.390 --> 05:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
really take the time to get this right
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
and not continue to use the same outm
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
outmoded models um which are far too
 
05:45:37.590 --> 05:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
reliant on disposal Tech Technologies
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr taill any
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
taill all right seeing none thank you
 
05:45:53.830 --> 05:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
testimony oh we have Mr Morgan now has
 
05:45:59.270 --> 05:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
his hand raised so I'll go back to him
 
05:45:59.280 --> 05:46:00.350 align:start position:0%
his hand raised so I'll go back to him
Mark

05:46:00.350 --> 05:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
Mark
 
05:46:00.360 --> 05:46:04.750 align:start position:0%
Mark
Morgan

05:46:04.750 --> 05:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:09.558 align:start position:0%
from go ahead Mr Mor okay I'm sorry the
 
05:46:10.948 --> 05:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
the unmute settings are a little
 
05:46:13.510 --> 05:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
different on this thank you for H for
 
05:46:16.750 --> 05:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
your time um I'm the solid waste manager
 
05:46:20.670 --> 05:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
for the city of Lebanon and um I've been
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
working in the waste and recycling
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire for several
 
05:46:29.628 --> 05:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
decades um and during my career I worked
 
05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Department of
 
05:46:33.468 --> 05:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services for a group
 
05:46:36.350 --> 05:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
called the uh Solid Waste planning and
 
05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
community assistance group um our
 
05:46:42.830 --> 05:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
primary task was to do Solid Waste
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
planning uh that group has not been EX
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
in existence for a number of years and
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
as a result uh the state of New
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not doing Solid Waste
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
planning um I firmly appreciate
 
05:46:59.590 --> 05:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's uh comments about increasing
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
recycling the unfortunate thing is that
 
05:47:04.190 --> 05:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
the majority of New Hampshire's
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
landfills are managed by private
 
05:47:08.990 --> 05:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
entities where if we increase recycling
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
it'll it's not going to impact the
 
05:47:13.468 --> 05:47:13.478 align:start position:0%
overall disposal at those landfills I'm
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
not saying that recycling is not a good
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
thing it absolutely should be part of
 
05:47:20.830 --> 05:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
the equation however without fully
 
05:47:22.750 --> 05:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the the state of the
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh position in the waste
 
05:47:28.788 --> 05:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
industry as well as how we um figure
 
05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
into the Region's waste disposal needs
 
05:47:34.150 --> 05:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
for instance in the past decade the
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts has issued
 
05:47:39.788 --> 05:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
disposal bands they've also issued
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
moratoriums on landfill expansions as a
 
05:47:44.830 --> 05:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
result waste from Massachusetts is
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
pouring into the state of New Hampshire
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
just because it's um it's an easier flow
 
05:47:53.948 --> 05:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
for Waste uh than going into
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so we did not prepare for
 
05:48:00.270 --> 05:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
that those regulatory changes in our
 
05:48:03.310 --> 05:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
neighboring states um because we don't
 
05:48:06.468 --> 05:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
have a group that looks at that uh Dees
 
05:48:08.788 --> 05:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
does an excellent job at at doing what
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
they do and focusing on statutory
 
05:48:14.590 --> 05:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
obligations but planning is a critical
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
piece in um managing New Hampshire's
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
future disposal needs simply looking at
 
05:48:22.990 --> 05:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
permits and determining their
 
05:48:27.390 --> 05:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility and correctness for um you
 
05:48:31.948 --> 05:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
know rules um is not planning um looking
 
05:48:34.150 --> 05:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
at what we need the future growth of
 
05:48:37.150 --> 05:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
this state and what our hopes and Desir
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
are um is not accomplished by issuing
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
permits alone I I can't emphasize the
 
05:48:44.670 --> 05:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
need for solid waste planning in the
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um it does not
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue but It prepares um our
 
05:48:52.270 --> 05:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
residents businesses and institutions
 
05:48:54.430 --> 05:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
for a more secure future both
 
05:48:57.070 --> 05:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
environmentally fiscally and uh and
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
socially so those are my comments um in
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill I couldn't support
 
05:49:08.750 --> 05:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
it more I My Hope is that um you know
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
that the state would see more value in
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
in looking to the Future um in and
 
05:49:18.510 --> 05:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
looking more broadly at this at this
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
issue thank you Mr Morgan any questions
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:27.788 --> 05:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
Morgan I one representative Stapleton uh
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
05:49:33.548 --> 05:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
Morgan that is quite disturbing um that
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
bans of certain materials waste in
 
05:49:40.590 --> 05:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts forces the move to fill
 
05:49:43.948 --> 05:49:43.958 align:start position:0%
our landfills here in New Hampshire do
 
05:49:47.788 --> 05:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
we have any type of bands of such
 
05:49:53.468 --> 05:49:53.478 align:start position:0%
materials to limit that sort of uh
 
05:49:55.708 --> 05:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
transfer um I'm I'm not aware of
 
05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
anything New Hampshire does have its own
 
05:50:02.110 --> 05:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
waste bands but one um example of just
 
05:50:04.510 --> 05:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts's impact on New Hampshire
 
05:50:07.750 --> 05:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
is in Massachusetts you can't landfill
 
05:50:09.990 --> 05:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
unprocessed construction and demolition
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
debris so what that means is you tear
 
05:50:14.628 --> 05:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
down a house in
 
05:50:17.070 --> 05:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that waste from a house
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
tear down has to be sorted and ground up
 
05:50:21.990 --> 05:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
um before it can make its way into a
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
landfill that's not required in New
 
05:50:27.788 --> 05:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the cost of that activity
 
05:50:29.948 --> 05:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
um is expensive and from a business
 
05:50:32.190 --> 05:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint it's easier to move that
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
waste into New Hampshire where we're
 
05:50:36.750 --> 05:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
managing construction and demolition
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
debris already but unprocessed
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
consumes a disproportionate amount of
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
space in a landfill and by that what I
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
mean is you know a ton of construction
 
05:50:51.390 --> 05:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
demolition debris consumes an far more
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
airspace in a landfill than a ton of
 
05:50:57.868 --> 05:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste or or processed
 
05:50:59.260 --> 05:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:51:01.070 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition
[Music]

05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:51:05.910 --> 05:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
debris follow up uh one follow yep so um
 
05:51:08.910 --> 05:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
we we need to be looking at uh some
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
regulation or statute to uh protect our
 
05:51:16.990 --> 05:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity by U similar bands do
 
05:51:17.000 --> 05:51:17.708 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity by U similar bands do
we

05:51:17.708 --> 05:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
not um again I think that's part of
 
05:51:23.708 --> 05:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
planning and before we just start doing
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
um forgive me sir knee-jerk reactions
 
05:51:29.350 --> 05:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
with statutory responses to neighboring
 
05:51:32.230 --> 05:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
states um legislative activities we need
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
to understand what they're doing um a
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
lot of waste in Mass Massachusetts is
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
moving to uh the Midwest right now um by
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
rail so it's actually being transported
 
05:51:48.310 --> 05:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
far distances um out of our region but
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
um we need to understand exactly what um
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
what n Hampshire is doing what our
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
forecast looks like before we start
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
making um I mean I appreciate and
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
applaud your desire to
 
05:52:05.070 --> 05:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
um to ban certain waste the city of
 
05:52:08.030 --> 05:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon has done that locally we passed
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
an ordinance Banning the disposal in in
 
05:52:13.110 --> 05:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
our landfill of unprocessed construction
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
and demolition debris as a method to uh
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
manage uh you know reduced landfill
 
05:52:25.708 --> 05:52:25.718 align:start position:0%
disposal um landfills fill up by Nature
 
05:52:27.750 --> 05:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we need to be looking at them you
 
05:52:31.548 --> 05:52:31.558 align:start position:0%
know as as literal spaces that um that
 
05:52:35.110 --> 05:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
will go away and at some point in our
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
children's future
 
05:52:38.350 --> 05:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
they will be faced with having to make
 
05:52:40.430 --> 05:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
disposal decisions that we are not even

enthusiastic support for um House Bill
 
05:53:25.468 --> 05:53:25.478 align:start position:0%
413 to move forward um there's several
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
Provisions in it that would help the
 
05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
town of hopkington with our Solid Waste
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
Management challenges over the past six
 
05:53:34.110 --> 05:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
years um we share a transport station
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
with uh with with Webster and Hopkinson
 
05:53:38.948 --> 05:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
um we've experienced a disproportionate
 
05:53:41.230 --> 05:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
incre increase in the amount of waste
 
05:53:43.390 --> 05:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
coming to our transfer station um while
 
05:53:46.590 --> 05:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
our population Rose by only about 2%
 
05:53:49.708 --> 05:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
from 2013 to 2019 our total waste tonage
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
stored by nearly 12% we're currently
 
05:53:55.628 --> 05:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
producing over 3,000 tons of mssw mix
 
05:53:57.990 --> 05:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste annually um not including
 
05:54:00.150 --> 05:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the additional tonnage of other waste
 
05:54:02.230 --> 05:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
like construction um and de demolition
 
05:54:04.468 --> 05:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
debris Tire shingles the like um
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly Co has had some impact on
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
this growth in disposable waste but the
 
05:54:11.468 --> 05:54:11.478 align:start position:0%
onset of the trend predated the P the
 
05:54:14.030 --> 05:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic um we really don't fully
 
05:54:16.350 --> 05:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
understand why our waste has increased
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
um to its current level but the trend is
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
super concerning um concurrent to the
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
increase in solid waste volume our
 
05:54:25.468 --> 05:54:25.478 align:start position:0%
ability to cover the cost of disposal
 
05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
has diminished as of January 1 of this
 
05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
year we entered into into a new
 
05:54:32.468 --> 05:54:32.478 align:start position:0%
five-year contract with Waste Management
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
to transport and dispose of our mixed
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste and our our price increased
 
05:54:41.468 --> 05:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
by almost $10 a ton um in 2021 and will
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
continue to increase incrementally by
 
05:54:45.548 --> 05:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
contract through
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
2025 um Meanwhile we're really
 
05:54:49.948 --> 05:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
struggling with low participation in our
 
05:54:52.110 --> 05:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
pay as you throw bag program um it's
 
05:54:55.150 --> 05:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
been in effect since 2010 and it
 
05:54:58.230 --> 05:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
was our disposal
 
05:55:00.548 --> 05:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
costs are you reading the testimony that
 
05:55:03.910 --> 05:55:03.920 align:start position:0%

initiatives uh that Mr Tuttle referenced
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
earlier and um the underlying pres
 
05:56:30.670 --> 05:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
premise is that waste is a behavior it's
 
05:56:33.150 --> 05:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
something we do collectively and as
 
05:56:36.468 --> 05:56:36.478 align:start position:0%

before us because the federal government
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
which normally controls product labeling
 
06:05:53.948 --> 06:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
hasn't acted uh we had a public hearing
 
06:05:56.190 --> 06:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh I think approximately
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
two or three weeks ago there were a
 
06:06:01.510 --> 06:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
number of suggestions made by the public
 
06:06:04.948 --> 06:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
at that time and representative kerk who
 
06:06:07.910 --> 06:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
is also on the call uh and I have been
 
06:06:10.110 --> 06:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
working to incorporate all of those
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
suggestions into the bill so basically
 
06:06:16.468 --> 06:06:16.478 align:start position:0%
what you have with the amendment uh is a
 
06:06:19.628 --> 06:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
replacement of the bill and I believe
 
06:06:22.468 --> 06:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
all of you have received uh some
 
06:06:25.628 --> 06:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
correspondents from representative kerk
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
that outlines uh the changes that were
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
made but in in summary it was suggested
 
06:06:37.788 --> 06:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
that instead of uh having the HHS do the
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
uh inspection uh of Laboratories that we
 
06:06:45.948 --> 06:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
go with Laboratories that our ISO
 
06:06:48.548 --> 06:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
certified and that was placed in the
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill um so that uh it lessens the amount
 
06:06:55.548 --> 06:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
of work that HHS has to do uh there was
 
06:06:59.548 --> 06:06:59.558 align:start position:0%
also um a suggestion that we add an
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
expiration date as to one of the things
 
06:07:07.190 --> 06:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
that would be on the label and the main
 
06:07:10.030 --> 06:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
thing that um committee members I
 
06:07:13.070 --> 06:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
believe were concerned with uh was how
 
06:07:15.990 --> 06:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
the implementation of this bill uh was
 
06:07:18.990 --> 06:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
going to be paid for and we came up with
 
06:07:23.548 --> 06:07:23.558 align:start position:0%
the idea of creating a canaba pro uh uh
 
06:07:27.390 --> 06:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
program fund that we are looking to
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
Industry um to help fund along with
 
06:07:31.680 --> 06:07:33.030 align:start position:0%
Industry um to help fund along with
registration

06:07:33.030 --> 06:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
registration
 
06:07:36.670 --> 06:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
fees uh so regarding the registration
 
06:07:38.788 --> 06:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
fee you'll see in the amendment that
 
06:07:42.468 --> 06:07:42.478 align:start position:0%
we've um decided on
 
06:07:47.230 --> 06:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
$250 for a registration fee per product
 
06:07:50.270 --> 06:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
and a product would be considered a
 
06:07:54.190 --> 06:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
formulation um not determined by size so
 
06:07:56.910 --> 06:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
if the product had the same formulation
 
06:08:01.190 --> 06:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
but it was offered in various uh sizes
 
06:08:03.390 --> 06:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
that would be considered one
 
06:08:06.030 --> 06:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
registration um we talked to industry
 
06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
leaders uh in this area and we got
 
06:08:12.750 --> 06:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
registration prices all the way from
 
06:08:16.430 --> 06:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
$50 would be adequate to up to
 
06:08:19.990 --> 06:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
$500 uh so it was all over the uh all
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
over the map and and we felt that
 
06:08:26.270 --> 06:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
$250 per product uh would be
 
06:08:28.948 --> 06:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable um we also I also have a
 
06:08:32.150 --> 06:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
letter that I sent out to you from the
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh NPA the natural products Association
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh they're the first to come on board
 
06:08:41.670 --> 06:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
and uh will be committing funds uh to
 
06:08:44.670 --> 06:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
the cannibal dial program fund uh we've
 
06:08:47.350 --> 06:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
reached out to other industry uh
 
06:08:50.230 --> 06:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
resources also have not heard back but
 
06:08:51.788 --> 06:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
this is something that we would want to
 
06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
continue to um to work on um so with
 
06:08:59.548 --> 06:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
that um I'll take any questions that you
 
06:09:01.628 --> 06:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
might have and if I can't answer them uh
 
06:09:03.670 --> 06:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
I believe representative kerk would be
 
06:09:07.468 --> 06:09:07.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:10.350 --> 06:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh is there any
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
other comments I see representative
 
06:09:14.750 --> 06:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
Aaron has her hand up yes thank you and
 
06:09:18.430 --> 06:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your work on this
 
06:09:22.110 --> 06:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanted to clarify
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh what what we had uh come to terms
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
with with regard to uh sales coming from
 
06:09:30.240 --> 06:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
with with regard to uh sales coming from
the

06:09:31.910 --> 06:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:09:34.868 --> 06:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
internet for maybe businesses that are
 
06:09:34.878 --> 06:09:36.510 align:start position:0%
internet for maybe businesses that are
are

06:09:36.510 --> 06:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:09:40.910 --> 06:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:43.868 --> 06:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
or I I think rep Bixby is actually going
 
06:09:46.030 --> 06:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
to comment on that so why don't we uh
 
06:09:49.270 --> 06:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
why don't we let him answer that right
 
06:09:55.670 --> 06:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
so um the uh the bill as amended has the
 
06:10:00.150 --> 06:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
phrase uh that basically defines a uh
 
06:10:04.750 --> 06:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
kabad a CBD product as including uh
 
06:10:06.830 --> 06:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
products are sold over the internet in
 
06:10:09.150 --> 06:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
terms of how that's actually going to be
 
06:10:12.910 --> 06:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
policed uh as with all the other um
 
06:10:16.110 --> 06:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh elements of the bill that
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
is something that uh will be done
 
06:10:21.468 --> 06:10:21.478 align:start position:0%
through rul making in uh in
 
06:10:25.628 --> 06:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
DHS uh so um you whether whether it's a
 
06:10:29.070 --> 06:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
u and in terms of uh whether the origin
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the product is uh from New Hampshire
 
06:10:37.868 --> 06:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
or from out of state uh it does for with
 
06:10:40.230 --> 06:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
with the exception of food products it
 
06:10:42.868 --> 06:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter where the uh product is
 
06:10:45.628 --> 06:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
coming from it needs to be registered uh
 
06:10:48.830 --> 06:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
with food products there is currently a
 
06:10:52.468 --> 06:10:52.478 align:start position:0%
limitation on being able to trans uh to
 
06:10:56.830 --> 06:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
sell a food product with CBD in it uh
 
06:10:58.948 --> 06:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
made in New Hampshire out of state and
 
06:11:01.868 --> 06:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
that's be if doing that would violate a
 
06:11:01.878 --> 06:11:02.830 align:start position:0%
that's be if doing that would violate a
Federal

06:11:02.830 --> 06:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
06:11:06.708 --> 06:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
Regulation and uh that's why we have uh
 
06:11:09.750 --> 06:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
said that food products need to be uh
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
just within the state and there's also a
 
06:11:16.030 --> 06:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
um Clause there that says that if the
 
06:11:18.628 --> 06:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
federal government uh gets rid of the
 
06:11:21.750 --> 06:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
Restriction then uh there is no then New
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will have no restriction
 
06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
either uh so I I think that uh covers
 
06:11:32.830 --> 06:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
the um the internet sales part um and in
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's another part that um so uh
 
06:11:39.708 --> 06:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearl and I uh did the did the
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
final Amendment and what we did was in
 
06:11:44.910 --> 06:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
the the the amendment that you saw
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday had an appropriation which uh
 
06:11:51.230 --> 06:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
would have come from otherwise unused
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
funds uh in the governor's discretion we
 
06:11:57.628 --> 06:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
remove that appropriation and the entire
 
06:12:00.670 --> 06:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
funding will come through the canabal
 
06:12:04.110 --> 06:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
program fund which uh will be donated to
 
06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
by people in the dist
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
R thank you representative I think
 
06:12:11.230 --> 06:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
that's a key important part to this
 
06:12:13.910 --> 06:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is that this program will be
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
self-funding or it will not exist we're
 
06:12:17.390 --> 06:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
not looking for any general fund
 
06:12:20.468 --> 06:12:20.478 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and I I think the the
 
06:12:22.350 --> 06:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
industry is asking for this program and
 
06:12:23.910 --> 06:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
the industry is willing to support it
 
06:12:26.670 --> 06:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
and I I think that is a something that I
 
06:12:26.680 --> 06:12:28.190 align:start position:0%
and I I think that is a something that I
can

06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:12:30.990 --> 06:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
support there any other discussion
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh Pearl thank you for
 
06:12:35.310 --> 06:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
that and I just want to underscore that
 
06:12:37.590 --> 06:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
that this is really coming from the
 
06:12:40.708 --> 06:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
industry uh it's it's Market driven
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
they've seen you know exponential growth
 
06:12:45.390 --> 06:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
in the industry and at the same time
 
06:12:47.788 --> 06:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
they've seen a number of Bad actors
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
enter and they feel that if we can't
 
06:12:53.430 --> 06:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
tighten this up in terms of the labeling
 
06:12:55.708 --> 06:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
and ensure that the consumer is getting
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
the product that they purchase uh that
 
06:13:00.830 --> 06:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
it could uh in the long term hurt the
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
industry thank you representative kapan
 
06:13:06.548 --> 06:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know I mean maybe this is
 
06:13:08.070 --> 06:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
something you've already considered Mr
 
06:13:09.990 --> 06:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question but
 
06:13:12.830 --> 06:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about the provision
 
06:13:15.070 --> 06:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
that says that all food products with
 
06:13:19.030 --> 06:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
CBD have to be uh how's it worded that
 
06:13:21.910 --> 06:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
the CBD has to be uh from New Hampshire
 
06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
so I my my question and my curiosity is
 
06:13:26.788 --> 06:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
how much of of the of hemp is actually
 
06:13:28.708 --> 06:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
being grown in New Hampshire at this
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
point to make that possible so I'll
 
06:13:36.030 --> 06:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
take can correct me if I
 
06:13:37.350 --> 06:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:13:41.230 --> 06:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
so so the the food product as so let
 
06:13:43.230 --> 06:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
let's say we're talking about uh a
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
brownie or um well just say we're
 
06:13:49.670 --> 06:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
talking about a brownie um that food Pro
 
06:13:51.670 --> 06:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
the food product is baked in New
 
06:13:55.628 --> 06:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the uh and the CBD is
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
added to it in New Hampshire but the
 
06:14:00.670 --> 06:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
origin of the CBD that is added to it
 
06:14:03.468 --> 06:14:03.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be New Hampshire the it

06:19:24.750 --> 06:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
177 prohibiting the sighting of a
 
06:19:27.628 --> 06:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
landfill near a state park I am going to
 
06:19:30.990 --> 06:19:31.000 align:start position:0%

06:19:39.430 --> 06:19:39.440 align:start position:0%

verville to speak to his
 
06:20:01.150 --> 06:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman uh the
 
06:20:04.910 --> 06:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
reason I mve this bill to be itl is that
 
06:20:07.030 --> 06:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
while it is a well-intentioned
 
06:20:11.110 --> 06:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
bill um it's a bit misleading I think in
 
06:20:15.070 --> 06:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
in its its aim and its aim uh seems to
 
06:20:18.350 --> 06:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
be directed at a particular uh project
 
06:20:20.750 --> 06:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the North country located to
 
06:20:24.788 --> 06:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake uh State Park and when we
 
06:20:27.548 --> 06:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony uh we heard a lot of
 
06:20:29.788 --> 06:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
testimony about protecting surface
 
06:20:32.590 --> 06:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
waters as well as state parks and
 
06:20:35.310 --> 06:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill uh that
 
06:20:38.230 --> 06:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
protects uh surface waters or or
 
06:20:40.230 --> 06:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
groundwater we heard testimony on
 
06:20:42.590 --> 06:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater it does nothing to change
 
06:20:46.750 --> 06:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
the the regulations it simply um forbids
 
06:20:49.230 --> 06:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
the sighting of a landfill within two
 
06:20:52.548 --> 06:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
miles of a state park a fairly
 
06:20:55.270 --> 06:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
convenient distance given um the
 
06:20:58.230 --> 06:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
proposed sighting given Forest Lake
 
06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
State Parks um position geographical
 
06:21:05.548 --> 06:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
position I was invited to visit uh
 
06:21:08.548 --> 06:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake uh residents and I I took
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
them up on that opportunity I visited
 
06:21:13.510 --> 06:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
the state park this project is not
 
06:21:16.468 --> 06:21:16.478 align:start position:0%
visible uh from the developed part of
 
06:21:20.070 --> 06:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
the state park in that area um so while
 
06:21:22.948 --> 06:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
I am sympathetic to the sponsors of the
 
06:21:25.230 --> 06:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill I don't believe that this is
 
06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
an appropriate vehicle for accomplishing
 
06:21:32.548 --> 06:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
the desired goal um and so um that is
 
06:21:36.270 --> 06:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
why I'm making a motion of it
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I expect
 
06:21:39.350 --> 06:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be a lot of discussion on this
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill so I will ask everyone to just put
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
their hand up and I will go through in
 
06:21:45.750 --> 06:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
the order that I see them uh
 
06:21:54.230 --> 06:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:54.240 --> 06:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
first

06:22:00.390 --> 06:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.030 --> 06:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
unmute there you go what this bill
 
06:22:07.830 --> 06:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
attempts to do is take a very precious
 
06:22:10.628 --> 06:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
resource for the State of New Hampshire
 
06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that is our uh state parks and put a
 
06:22:19.750 --> 06:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
buffer around them and um we have
 
06:22:22.030 --> 06:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
received testimony from a man named
 
06:22:25.110 --> 06:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
Stephen Walker in the form of a letter
 
06:22:28.110 --> 06:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
and he went through all of the state
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
parks in New Hampshire that don't have
 
06:22:36.390 --> 06:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
zoning and also um
 
06:22:39.030 --> 06:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
he made a list he intersected the list
 
06:22:43.708 --> 06:22:43.718 align:start position:0%
to see which ones could possibly have um
 
06:22:47.548 --> 06:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
a state a a landfill put next to them
 
06:22:49.750 --> 06:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
and those state parks would be Lake
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
Francis State Park Coleman State Park
 
06:22:57.070 --> 06:22:57.080 align:start position:0%

06:23:01.468 --> 06:23:01.478 align:start position:0%

White Lake State Park and ditch fille
 
06:23:12.750 --> 06:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
Knox ditch fille Knox State Park we our
 
06:23:17.628 --> 06:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
one of our best resources here and um is
 
06:23:19.590 --> 06:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
that we are a tourist
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
destination um
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
especially in the in the fall and the
 
06:23:27.910 --> 06:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
winter when um we have the leaf peeping
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
season and right now they're having a
 
06:23:33.750 --> 06:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
boom year up there with all the skiing
 
06:23:35.590 --> 06:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
06:23:39.548 --> 06:23:39.558 align:start position:0%
um it's just so fabulous up there and to
 
06:23:42.948 --> 06:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
just there's so many other places in New
 
06:23:45.310 --> 06:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to put a state park it does
 
06:23:47.868 --> 06:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
not have to be there and we've heard
 
06:23:47.878 --> 06:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
not have to be there and we've heard
today

06:23:49.110 --> 06:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:23:52.910 --> 06:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
already that we don't even have a plan
 
06:23:56.190 --> 06:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
the uh Solid Waste plan is so many years
 
06:23:57.390 --> 06:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
out of
 
06:24:02.590 --> 06:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
date and so just to um keep building
 
06:24:06.350 --> 06:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
them without a forward Bing plan it
 
06:24:11.070 --> 06:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
seems ludicrous to me and um I just
 
06:24:13.590 --> 06:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's where my feelings are with
 
06:24:18.990 --> 06:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
it it's it this to protect our natural
 
06:24:22.750 --> 06:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
resources is first second of all water
 
06:24:26.190 --> 06:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
is life third the tourist industry the
 
06:24:29.270 --> 06:24:29.280 align:start position:0%

mom and pop Industries up there need to
have

06:24:30.510 --> 06:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:24:33.750 --> 06:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
protection that's all Mr chairman thank
 
06:24:35.220 --> 06:24:35.230 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:24:35.230 --> 06:24:37.150 align:start position:0%
you representative
[Music]

06:24:37.150 --> 06:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:24:39.788 --> 06:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you Mr
 
06:24:44.030 --> 06:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I am extremely opposed to an
 
06:24:45.990 --> 06:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
itl motion and and obviously I'm going
 
06:24:48.510 --> 06:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
to vote against it uh and and that's for
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons first is that
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
tourism is a major economic driver for
 
06:24:55.230 --> 06:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire especially in the North
 
06:24:58.070 --> 06:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
Country I have here petitions from 40
 
06:25:00.070 --> 06:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
small business owners in the neighboring
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
town of Littleton who opposed the
 
06:25:04.830 --> 06:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
proposed landfill near Forest Lake I'd
 
06:25:06.310 --> 06:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
like to think that they know better than
 
06:25:08.708 --> 06:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
anyone about the economic implications
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
of a project for their local area even
 
06:25:13.750 --> 06:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
Governor suu's Commissioner of business
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs Taylor Caswell has
 
06:25:20.110 --> 06:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
come out against this landfill on nhpr's
 
06:25:22.110 --> 06:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
the exchange just a couple days before
 
06:25:23.510 --> 06:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the public
 
06:25:25.868 --> 06:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
hearing it's clear to me that our state
 
06:25:27.948 --> 06:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
parks are the secret sauce of our
 
06:25:30.548 --> 06:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
tourism industry they're just as much a
 
06:25:32.190 --> 06:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
part of the New Hampshire Advantage as
 
06:25:35.590 --> 06:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
no sales tax or income tax is
 
06:25:37.310 --> 06:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
secondly well we've certainly talked a
 
06:25:39.150 --> 06:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
lot about one particular proposed
 
06:25:41.708 --> 06:25:41.718 align:start position:0%
landfill this bill is not exclusive to
 
06:25:44.190 --> 06:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake I want to remind everyone
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
that this bill is about all of our state
 
06:25:49.230 --> 06:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
parks think about Rolland State Park in
 
06:25:50.990 --> 06:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
your neck of the woods representative
 
06:25:53.788 --> 06:25:53.798 align:start position:0%
Kennedy or Silver Lake uh in your
 
06:25:55.830 --> 06:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
District representative
 
06:25:58.548 --> 06:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
hola these places have been sacred to
 
06:26:00.590 --> 06:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
the residents and visitors of our state
 
06:26:02.310 --> 06:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
going back
 
06:26:05.310 --> 06:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
Generations my dad took me to Puckaway
 
06:26:06.990 --> 06:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
when I was a kid he also took me to
 
06:26:10.110 --> 06:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
Kingston State Park and White Lake in
 
06:26:12.670 --> 06:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
Tamworth now I take my daughter to those
 
06:26:15.270 --> 06:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
places and you know what's changed in 30
 
06:26:17.750 --> 06:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
years since my dad took me to those
 
06:26:20.510 --> 06:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Parks absolutely
 
06:26:22.670 --> 06:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
nothing and that's the beauty of our
 
06:26:24.910 --> 06:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
Parks as the prime sponsor mentioned
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
it's like going back in
 
06:26:29.468 --> 06:26:29.478 align:start position:0%
time if we place a landfill next to your
 
06:26:30.830 --> 06:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
favorite state park what do you think
 
06:26:32.548 --> 06:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
it'll look like in 30
 
06:26:35.590 --> 06:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
years think it'll smell
 
06:26:37.948 --> 06:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
like additionally it's a well-known fact
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
that the EPA has stated that all
 
06:26:41.590 --> 06:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
landfills leak
 
06:26:44.110 --> 06:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
eventually so if we don't pass this bill
 
06:26:46.030 --> 06:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
and a landfill is placed close to a
 
06:26:49.708 --> 06:26:49.718 align:start position:0%
state park it's not a question of if the
 
06:26:51.590 --> 06:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
park will be negatively affected by the
 
06:26:54.868 --> 06:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
landfill it's a question of
 
06:26:57.390 --> 06:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
when in the past couple years we've been
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
learning a lot about the dangers of
 
06:27:01.590 --> 06:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
pasas look at the K landfill on the Sea
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
Coast it's been leaking toxic chemicals
 
06:27:06.510 --> 06:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
into the water for decades and we've
 
06:27:10.030 --> 06:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
seen a um a pediatric cancer cluster
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
emerge there if you've ever been a
 
06:27:14.110 --> 06:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
Disneyland in Anaheim California you'll
 
06:27:15.990 --> 06:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
notice that when you go through the gate
 
06:27:18.190 --> 06:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
there's a sign that reads and this is
 
06:27:21.750 --> 06:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
real Disneyland contains chemicals known
 
06:27:24.030 --> 06:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
to the state of California to cause
 
06:27:26.350 --> 06:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
cancer birth defects and other
 
06:27:28.910 --> 06:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
reproductive harm do we want to have to
 
06:27:31.628 --> 06:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
put a sign like that up at pakway or
 
06:27:31.638 --> 06:27:33.110 align:start position:0%
put a sign like that up at pakway or
White

06:27:33.110 --> 06:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
White
 
06:27:36.030 --> 06:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
Lake a two-mile buffer zone around an
 
06:27:38.030 --> 06:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
important natural resource like a state
 
06:27:40.430 --> 06:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
park is not without precedent in the
 
06:27:43.070 --> 06:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
United States I've sent a letter around
 
06:27:44.708 --> 06:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
to the committee members from the head
 
06:27:46.708 --> 06:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
of the Raleigh North Carolina office of
 
06:27:49.310 --> 06:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
the fish and wildlife service which is
 
06:27:51.708 --> 06:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of the Interior
 
06:27:53.350 --> 06:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
this letter was sent to the North
 
06:27:56.350 --> 06:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
Carolina House and Senate environment
 
06:27:57.830 --> 06:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and agriculture committees when they
 
06:28:00.430 --> 06:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
were considering similar
 
06:28:02.670 --> 06:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
legislation it laid out technical
 
06:28:06.750 --> 06:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
information to justify a fem buffer zone
 
06:28:09.830 --> 06:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
around National Wildlife refuges the
 
06:28:11.190 --> 06:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill that was ultimately passed and
 
06:28:12.830 --> 06:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
signed in the law did include that
 
06:28:15.548 --> 06:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
fivemile buffer and also included a on
 
06:28:18.590 --> 06:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
Mile buffer around gameland and a two
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
mile buffer around state
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
parks so North Carolina does exactly
 
06:28:25.750 --> 06:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing
 
06:28:29.750 --> 06:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
here furthermore Georgia has a 3.2 mile
 
06:28:32.030 --> 06:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
buffer zone around their historic sites
 
06:28:34.468 --> 06:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey has a six and a quar mile
 
06:28:36.708 --> 06:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
buffer zone around their National Parks
 
06:28:38.110 --> 06:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife
 
06:28:40.708 --> 06:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
areas and these are not States known for
 
06:28:43.868 --> 06:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
their overreaching Environmental
 
06:28:46.510 --> 06:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
Protections the letter went into detail
 
06:28:48.868 --> 06:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
about why these buffers are established
 
06:28:50.070 --> 06:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're established because of a
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
landfill is placed near a precious
 
06:28:54.468 --> 06:28:54.478 align:start position:0%
natural resource any one of the
 
06:28:57.350 --> 06:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
following negative impacts can occur
 
06:28:59.708 --> 06:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
diminished public enjoyment and
 
06:29:01.948 --> 06:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
resulting reduction in visitation due to
 
06:29:04.750 --> 06:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
viewscape noise and odor
 
06:29:07.110 --> 06:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
impacts various negative impacts to
 
06:29:09.990 --> 06:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
Native Wildlife from landfill scavengers
 
06:29:12.670 --> 06:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
through displacement depredation of
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
nesting sites and
 
06:29:16.670 --> 06:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
harassment modification of hydrology
 
06:29:18.788 --> 06:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
patterns and potential off-site
 
06:29:21.468 --> 06:29:21.478 align:start position:0%
consequences water quality degradation
 
06:29:23.788 --> 06:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
resulting from potential failures and
 
06:29:23.798 --> 06:29:25.270 align:start position:0%
resulting from potential failures and
unintended

06:29:25.270 --> 06:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
06:29:27.788 --> 06:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
releases alteration of function and
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
value of local Wetland areas and
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
increased vehicular traffic particularly
 
06:29:35.310 --> 06:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
large trucks and associated impacts to
 
06:29:38.390 --> 06:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
Wildlife I am not anti-
 
06:29:41.310 --> 06:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
landfill I understand trash has to go
 
06:29:43.468 --> 06:29:43.478 align:start position:0%
somewhere but I do think we should make
 
06:29:45.310 --> 06:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
sure that they're placed in such a way
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
to reduce the negative
 
06:29:49.750 --> 06:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
consequences but placing one just feet
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
from a state park is not how we reduce
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
negative consequences it's how we
 
06:29:54.840 --> 06:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
negative consequences it's how we
guarantee

06:29:55.990 --> 06:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
06:29:58.670 --> 06:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
them so to sum it up the message should
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
be loud and clear here small businesses
 
06:30:03.350 --> 06:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to see landfills near State
 
06:30:03.360 --> 06:30:04.788 align:start position:0%
don't want to see landfills near State
Parks

06:30:04.788 --> 06:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
Parks
 
06:30:07.788 --> 06:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state don't want that
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
and visitors of our state don't want
 
06:30:12.310 --> 06:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
them either this is a common sense and
 
06:30:15.150 --> 06:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that protects all of our
 
06:30:17.590 --> 06:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
state parks from the severe negative
 
06:30:19.510 --> 06:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
consequences of nearby
 
06:30:21.510 --> 06:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
landfills and I hope you join me in
 
06:30:23.670 --> 06:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
voting no on this itl motion thank you
 
06:30:26.708 --> 06:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative thank
 
06:30:28.830 --> 06:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
you representative representative holas
 
06:30:30.270 --> 06:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
I'll allow you to go next since you were
 
06:30:34.110 --> 06:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
invoked in representative V statement um
 
06:30:37.110 --> 06:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
one of I know this is a very difficult
 
06:30:39.190 --> 06:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
decision and this has been a very
 
06:30:41.230 --> 06:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
difficult decision for everybody on the
 
06:30:42.990 --> 06:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee we take what people say very
 
06:30:45.708 --> 06:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
seriously we've heard a lot of testimony
 
06:30:48.070 --> 06:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
for people in opposition and we've also
 
06:30:50.388 --> 06:30:50.398 align:start position:0%
received testimony or received letters
 
06:30:52.830 --> 06:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
from people who want this project to go
 
06:30:54.750 --> 06:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
forward uh not this bill but I'm sorry
 
06:30:57.190 --> 06:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
who want this bill not to go forward
 
06:31:00.070 --> 06:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
people of Dalton one of the things that
 
06:31:04.310 --> 06:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
that I kind of take note with is that um
 
06:31:06.708 --> 06:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
you know we the part of this bill that
 
06:31:09.350 --> 06:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
that I can't get over is the fact that
 
06:31:11.070 --> 06:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's not that there's a two mile buffer
 
06:31:12.628 --> 06:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
being proposed around a state park I
 
06:31:14.510 --> 06:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
think that sounds like a you know I
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
think that sounds reasonable in many
 
06:31:17.628 --> 06:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
terms what really bothers me is it
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
didn't occur to anyone to make this bill
 
06:31:22.468 --> 06:31:22.478 align:start position:0%
before this project in Dalton was being
 
06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
executed and and that to me seems like
 
06:31:30.388 --> 06:31:30.398 align:start position:0%
we're we're using legislative powers to
 
06:31:33.548 --> 06:31:33.558 align:start position:0%
um overreach into an area and and that's
 
06:31:36.388 --> 06:31:36.398 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm really against and and I
 
06:31:38.110 --> 06:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
understand as you had mentioned
 
06:31:40.190 --> 06:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton about you know
 
06:31:42.868 --> 06:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
invoking Silver Lake I I totally
 
06:31:44.590 --> 06:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying I will say
 
06:31:46.788 --> 06:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
though that we can't hold some of these
 
06:31:48.590 --> 06:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
some of these places up on a pedestal
 
06:31:50.270 --> 06:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
because one of the word on the street
 
06:31:51.868 --> 06:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
and H is the best time to go to Silver
 
06:31:53.750 --> 06:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
Lake is when it's frozen because there's
 
06:31:55.350 --> 06:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of housing around there and quite
 
06:31:58.468 --> 06:31:58.478 align:start position:0%
frankly they get a lot of um bacterial
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
problems so I although I I'm not using
 
06:32:03.510 --> 06:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
that as a reason I'm just saying I'm not
 
06:32:05.350 --> 06:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
let's put everything up on a pedestal
 
06:32:07.910 --> 06:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
because not everything is without
 
06:32:10.510 --> 06:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
problems sometimes already thank you
 
06:32:13.030 --> 06:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
very much thank you representative uh
 
06:32:13.040 --> 06:32:17.030 align:start position:0%
very much thank you representative uh
representative

06:32:17.030 --> 06:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:20.830 --> 06:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
Perez um thank you for giving me the
 
06:32:25.708 --> 06:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity um I will I will say that I
 
06:32:29.430 --> 06:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
I I will support
 
06:32:33.030 --> 06:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
177 I've visited a lot of parks I've
 
06:32:34.628 --> 06:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
been going around
 
06:32:37.670 --> 06:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then seeing exactly you know the
 
06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful areas in New
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have so many people coming
 
06:32:47.190 --> 06:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
out of stay because New Hampshire is so
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
beautiful I have the opportunity last
 
06:32:52.628 --> 06:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
weekend to go and visit this park and
 
06:32:54.788 --> 06:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
exactly and then I and I saw exactly
 
06:32:57.468 --> 06:32:57.478 align:start position:0%
what this this this project is going to
 
06:33:00.830 --> 06:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
be and then I saw the houses and and
 
06:33:03.388 --> 06:33:03.398 align:start position:0%
people going to be able to see the trash
 
06:33:05.430 --> 06:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
I consider some of the small businesses
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the area and then how horrible is
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
going to be having these TR the trucks
 
06:33:12.548 --> 06:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
with trash
 
06:33:16.150 --> 06:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
driving by these little as small stores
 
06:33:18.990 --> 06:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
in in the area uh the economy is going
 
06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:33:23.830 --> 06:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
affected uh the and we're not talking
 
06:33:26.990 --> 06:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
about just this park we have so many
 
06:33:29.910 --> 06:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
beautiful areas and not stake we have so
 
06:33:33.830 --> 06:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
many people coming like even from around
 
06:33:35.670 --> 06:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
the world just to visit New Hampshire
 
06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
because we have such a beautiful state
 
06:33:40.548 --> 06:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
that I'm so proud I always told people
 
06:33:42.990 --> 06:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
that come in and visit new hire because
 
06:33:45.548 --> 06:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
in new hire we have so many beautiful
 
06:33:48.590 --> 06:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
places to visit but we don't want to put
 
06:33:48.600 --> 06:33:49.868 align:start position:0%
places to visit but we don't want to put
this

06:33:49.868 --> 06:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:33:52.590 --> 06:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
trash places close to the beautiful
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
parks and then not only that but let
 
06:33:59.670 --> 06:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
companies bring trash at a state we just
 
06:34:01.510 --> 06:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
heard from another bill that
 
06:34:03.788 --> 06:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is bringing some of their
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
trash to our state because it's cheaper
 
06:34:07.750 --> 06:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
to bring it to New Hampshire why are we
 
06:34:09.468 --> 06:34:09.478 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:34:13.548 --> 06:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
allow a company and then someone to put
 
06:34:16.868 --> 06:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
more trash into our into our state we
 
06:34:19.788 --> 06:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
has to protect our parks and that's all
 
06:34:22.150 --> 06:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
I has to
 
06:34:25.548 --> 06:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
say thank you thank you representative
 
06:34:28.510 --> 06:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:31.230 --> 06:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
Duty yes thank you uh I just wanted to
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
make a couple of points f first of all
 
06:34:37.708 --> 06:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
um even though cassella locating or
 
06:34:41.548 --> 06:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
trying to locate uh in this area was the
 
06:34:44.590 --> 06:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
impetus uh for this bill it's not the
 
06:34:48.150 --> 06:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
focus of the bill I know they want us to
 
06:34:50.628 --> 06:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
believe that it is but it really isn't
 
06:34:53.708 --> 06:34:53.718 align:start position:0%
it's the state parks that are the focus
 
06:34:57.388 --> 06:34:57.398 align:start position:0%
of this regarding the
 
06:35:01.468 --> 06:35:01.478 align:start position:0%
um um the comment that if we were really
 
06:35:03.830 --> 06:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about state parks we would
 
06:35:07.510 --> 06:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
have legislated this years ago there are
 
06:35:10.590 --> 06:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands and thousands of
 
06:35:13.510 --> 06:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
problems that have never come before the
 
06:35:15.990 --> 06:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislature because our constituents
 
06:35:18.270 --> 06:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
haven't brought us to them and we don't
 
06:35:20.830 --> 06:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
know they're a problem here we have a
 
06:35:23.788 --> 06:35:23.798 align:start position:0%
situation where our constituents brought
 
06:35:26.628 --> 06:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
us this issue we looked at the broader
 
06:35:30.230 --> 06:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
issue of not only Lake uh Lake Forest
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
but the fact that this could happen at
 
06:35:36.190 --> 06:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
at any of our state parks and looking at
 
06:35:40.388 --> 06:35:40.398 align:start position:0%
our state you know Statewide we decided
 
06:35:41.910 --> 06:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
that it was important to have
 
06:35:45.468 --> 06:35:45.478 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward in this area
 
06:35:48.628 --> 06:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh regarding this being a vendetta
 
06:35:51.388 --> 06:35:51.398 align:start position:0%
against one company I would say this is
 
06:35:54.388 --> 06:35:54.398 align:start position:0%
nothing different than years ago when
 
06:35:58.830 --> 06:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
certain cars started gas tanks exploded
 
06:36:02.510 --> 06:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
when they uh were in an accident that
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't a vend
 
06:36:09.750 --> 06:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
against Chevy or or GM or Ford okay it
 
06:36:12.910 --> 06:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
was an indication that we had a problem
 
06:36:15.430 --> 06:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the industry and the industry was
 
06:36:17.868 --> 06:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
looked at and they were asked to make
 
06:36:20.430 --> 06:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
changes so something like this didn't
 
06:36:24.270 --> 06:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
happen again so I would ask you to look
 
06:36:27.468 --> 06:36:27.478 align:start position:0%
at it in the spirit that this
 
06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was um was put forward thank
 
06:36:31.840 --> 06:36:34.190 align:start position:0%
legislation was um was put forward thank
you

06:36:34.190 --> 06:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:36:36.070 --> 06:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I think I'm
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
going to jump in here myself for just a
 
06:36:40.350 --> 06:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
minute and uh there just a couple of
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
points first off I want to thank the
 
06:36:45.030 --> 06:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh you're all bringing great
 
06:36:47.430 --> 06:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
points we're all having a very civilized
 
06:36:49.270 --> 06:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
and and excellent discussion and I I
 
06:36:50.708 --> 06:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
hope that the rest of the Committees
 
06:36:52.510 --> 06:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with bills whether
 
06:36:54.110 --> 06:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
maybe the committee isn't in agreement
 
06:36:56.110 --> 06:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
are all watching this and and learning
 
06:36:58.310 --> 06:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
and understanding that you can have a
 
06:37:00.150 --> 06:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversation amongst a group of people
 
06:37:01.628 --> 06:37:01.638 align:start position:0%
that don't always agree and it can be
 
06:37:03.628 --> 06:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
civil and polite and respectful so I
 
06:37:05.230 --> 06:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
want to applaud all of you for that
 
06:37:07.788 --> 06:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
first off I guess the points I want to
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
make here is my main concern with this
 
06:37:12.310 --> 06:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill and it was the same concern I had
 
06:37:13.830 --> 06:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
last year and I didn't get my questions
 
06:37:15.310 --> 06:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
answered this year either this is a
 
06:37:17.670 --> 06:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
landowner rights issue I have some a
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
real problem with putting an arbitrary
 
06:37:24.388 --> 06:37:24.398 align:start position:0%
limit in statute that isn't backed by
 
06:37:26.948 --> 06:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
science and and I certainly appreciate
 
06:37:28.150 --> 06:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
the uh all of the work that
 
06:37:29.548 --> 06:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
representative Balton has done on this
 
06:37:31.190 --> 06:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
because he's raised some great points
 
06:37:33.868 --> 06:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
and brought some great information
 
06:37:35.548 --> 06:37:35.558 align:start position:0%
we had a long discussion about this in
 
06:37:37.548 --> 06:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
our caucus as well I as I know you did
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
on on the Democratic caucus as well and
 
06:37:43.510 --> 06:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm positive that that happened and
 
06:37:46.230 --> 06:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of concern about the the
 
06:37:48.388 --> 06:37:48.398 align:start position:0%
similar problems that are being raised
 
06:37:50.070 --> 06:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
by this bill we just don't feel like
 
06:37:51.990 --> 06:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is the right vehicle to get us
 
06:37:55.590 --> 06:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
there I I've myself personally and and
 
06:37:57.548 --> 06:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
representative ER and my vice chair have
 
06:38:00.310 --> 06:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
had lengthy conversations with Dees
 
06:38:02.548 --> 06:38:02.558 align:start position:0%
about this had some real discussion
 
06:38:04.548 --> 06:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
about is there way we could perhaps
 
06:38:06.388 --> 06:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
amend this and and change it and get to
 
06:38:08.468 --> 06:38:08.478 align:start position:0%
a point where we could achieve what
 
06:38:10.670 --> 06:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do which is help the
 
06:38:14.070 --> 06:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
community impact perhaps be a part of uh
 
06:38:16.948 --> 06:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
the sighting process we haven't got
 
06:38:18.670 --> 06:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
there yet we're trying to find a way to
 
06:38:21.430 --> 06:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
do that uh this bill doesn't get there
 
06:38:24.190 --> 06:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
in my opinion uh again I'm concerned
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
about the rabbit hole we'd be going down
 
06:38:27.708 --> 06:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
by saying okay well we don't want we're
 
06:38:29.190 --> 06:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
going to put this
 
06:38:32.628 --> 06:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
arbitrary um buffer zone on well well
 
06:38:34.750 --> 06:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
what's next a dairy farm we don't like
 
06:38:36.070 --> 06:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
the way that smells we don't like the
 
06:38:38.270 --> 06:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
way that looks so we could you know we
 
06:38:39.708 --> 06:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
could put that and say that couldn't be
 
06:38:41.670 --> 06:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
there and I realize they're not exactly
 
06:38:44.070 --> 06:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
the same but my point is when we start
 
06:38:46.350 --> 06:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
down this path we go in a direction that
 
06:38:48.110 --> 06:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think is dangerous for a legislature
 
06:38:52.670 --> 06:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
to go into um I I respect completely
 
06:38:54.230 --> 06:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's opinion on this because I
 
06:38:56.388 --> 06:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
know it's all coming from a a place of
 
06:38:58.910 --> 06:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
where we all care about our state and I
 
06:39:00.948 --> 06:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we all know
 
06:39:02.990 --> 06:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
that in the end that none of us are
 
06:39:04.868 --> 06:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
still certainly advocating for
 
06:39:06.910 --> 06:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
destruction of our state parks but we
 
06:39:09.388 --> 06:39:09.398 align:start position:0%
have to find uh some common ground in in
 
06:39:12.430 --> 06:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
a manner that would allow us to put the
 
06:39:14.070 --> 06:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
regulations that we feel we need are in
 
06:39:16.190 --> 06:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
place but but not stepping on that the
 
06:39:19.230 --> 06:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
landowner rights for one and uh that
 
06:39:22.070 --> 06:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's a major one for me and I I will
 
06:39:23.868 --> 06:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
reflect back on the previous bill that
 
06:39:26.750 --> 06:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
we just heard we had uh a lot of
 
06:39:29.548 --> 06:39:29.558 align:start position:0%
testimony coming from many people about
 
06:39:31.150 --> 06:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
ways that we can solve our Solid Waste
 
06:39:32.830 --> 06:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
issues I think we're going in a great
 
06:39:34.548 --> 06:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
Direction there you know the key
 
06:39:37.350 --> 06:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
certainly is reduction and we all accept
 
06:39:38.948 --> 06:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
we have to have a place to go with the
 
06:39:41.948 --> 06:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
remaining parts uh but one of the things
 
06:39:43.430 --> 06:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
that really stood out to me in that
 
06:39:45.990 --> 06:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
testimony was Dees does a great job at
 
06:39:49.548 --> 06:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
what they do that stood out to me and I
 
06:39:51.070 --> 06:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
have confidence in Dees that they're
 
06:39:53.030 --> 06:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing a great job in what they do and I
 
06:39:54.190 --> 06:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
have confidence that they're paying
 
06:39:55.830 --> 06:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
attention in when they're citing
 
06:39:58.670 --> 06:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
landfills so for that reason I'm going
 
06:40:02.070 --> 06:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
to support the itl and I appreciate all
 
06:40:04.150 --> 06:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
of you listening to my my two senseful
 
06:40:06.868 --> 06:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
this with that I going to go to
 
06:40:10.868 --> 06:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:13.468 --> 06:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr chair and I appreciate
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
your your uh your your analysis I think
 
06:40:18.750 --> 06:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
you have some good points um to me it it
 
06:40:21.230 --> 06:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
really comes down and and I recognize
 
06:40:23.190 --> 06:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
that this is a difficult issue with lots
 
06:40:26.030 --> 06:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
of valid viewpoints on both sides but to
 
06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
me I I just look at it as a cost benefit
 
06:40:31.230 --> 06:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
analysis and I just say you know what is
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of this bill going forward
 
06:40:36.350 --> 06:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
um and I see the the sunk time in
 
06:40:39.030 --> 06:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
investment of of the private company who
 
06:40:41.948 --> 06:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
uh has spent year you know I don't know
 
06:40:43.628 --> 06:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
how many years in in the planning
 
06:40:46.310 --> 06:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
process for this project but then I
 
06:40:47.708 --> 06:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
think well you know if there any if
 
06:40:49.750 --> 06:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
there are like any business worth worth
 
06:40:51.948 --> 06:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
its salt they've already started
 
06:40:54.150 --> 06:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
planning for this eventuality and I
 
06:40:55.110 --> 06:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it's really going to affect
 
06:40:57.350 --> 06:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
their bottom line much um there might be
 
06:40:59.510 --> 06:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
a cost of the landowner but really the
 
06:41:01.150 --> 06:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
cost of the land owner is nil because he
 
06:41:03.350 --> 06:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
still owns a land and he can sell it to
 
06:41:06.430 --> 06:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
another user um what is the benefit the
 
06:41:08.590 --> 06:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
benefit it allows the state to implement
 
06:41:09.708 --> 06:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
a thoughtful
 
06:41:13.548 --> 06:41:13.558 align:start position:0%
analysis of uh sighting possibilities
 
06:41:17.070 --> 06:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
and using uh a meth methodical and
 
06:41:18.990 --> 06:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
science-based Analysis to find a proper
 
06:41:22.190 --> 06:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
site to take care of our of our common
 
06:41:23.868 --> 06:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
problem which is what do we do with our
 
06:41:26.590 --> 06:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste um so that's that's how I
 
06:41:27.910 --> 06:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
look at
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:36.788 --> 06:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman you know I
 
06:41:39.310 --> 06:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
just because we're having a conversation
 
06:41:41.030 --> 06:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to Circle back to a couple
 
06:41:45.070 --> 06:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
of thing so I do a lot of camping with
 
06:41:48.110 --> 06:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
my family and we camp almost exclusively
 
06:41:50.310 --> 06:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire state parks and we've
 
06:41:52.590 --> 06:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
done that for decades right I bring my
 
06:41:53.948 --> 06:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
children there
 
06:41:57.468 --> 06:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
too and Puck away how many times did
 
06:42:00.110 --> 06:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
they close the beach at Puckaway last
 
06:42:02.788 --> 06:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
summer because of feal matter in the
 
06:42:02.798 --> 06:42:03.910 align:start position:0%
summer because of feal matter in the
water

06:42:03.910 --> 06:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
water
 
06:42:06.948 --> 06:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
which is actually caused by the
 
06:42:09.070 --> 06:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
campground by the state
 
06:42:12.868 --> 06:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
park how many people are aware that
 
06:42:16.868 --> 06:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
umbagog State Park got started right by
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
the purchasing of a private Campground
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
that was a private Campground that the
 
06:42:24.030 --> 06:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
state purchased and converted into a
 
06:42:26.708 --> 06:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
state park so would we have offered a
 
06:42:29.628 --> 06:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
bill to protect the private owner of
 
06:42:31.948 --> 06:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
that property had a landfill been
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
proposed within a 2 mile radius it's a
 
06:42:38.270 --> 06:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
fair question Lake Francis State Park
 
06:42:40.948 --> 06:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
one of my favorites I go up north every
 
06:42:42.468 --> 06:42:42.478 align:start position:0%
year for Independence Day for a week
 
06:42:44.750 --> 06:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
with my family and we stay at Lake
 
06:42:46.868 --> 06:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
Francis I've got reservation coming up
 
06:42:48.150 --> 06:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
06:42:51.708 --> 06:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
year Lake Francis State Park was a
 
06:42:54.070 --> 06:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
private Campground that the state
 
06:42:56.468 --> 06:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
purchased and converted into a state
 
06:42:59.628 --> 06:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
park so if a landfill would have been
 
06:43:02.270 --> 06:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
proposed within two miles of that
 
06:43:04.948 --> 06:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
property when it was privately held and
 
06:43:08.070 --> 06:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
that was not that long ago would we be
 
06:43:11.868 --> 06:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
considering legislation to protect it
 
06:43:14.670 --> 06:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the small businesses
 
06:43:16.590 --> 06:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
that we that potentially could be
 
06:43:19.910 --> 06:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted by a
 
06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
landfill up by Forest Lake not on Forest
 
06:43:28.070 --> 06:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
Lake near Forest Lake would we support a
 
06:43:30.830 --> 06:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill that would prohibit the sighting of
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
a landfill within two miles of any
 
06:43:37.510 --> 06:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
private small business that may
 
06:43:40.190 --> 06:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate a negative impact to their
 
06:43:42.670 --> 06:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
business would we file that bill would
 
06:43:45.910 --> 06:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:49.230 --> 06:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
bill the state parks sort of are the
 
06:43:51.628 --> 06:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
buffer right when there's the very
 
06:43:54.548 --> 06:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
valuable piece of property the the the
 
06:43:56.670 --> 06:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
monument the natural wonder that we want
 
06:43:59.788 --> 06:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
to preserve it is the state park it's
 
06:44:02.590 --> 06:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
that land that provides the buffer
 
06:44:05.708 --> 06:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
around that particular item and so to
 
06:44:09.030 --> 06:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
extend it out past that um for me is is
 
06:44:11.110 --> 06:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
a bit of a stretch too far and
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative sopus hits the nail on
 
06:44:17.430 --> 06:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
the head absolutely right this is a
 
06:44:21.510 --> 06:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
zoning issue this is a zoning issue so
 
06:44:24.230 --> 06:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
Dalton doesn't have zoning that
 
06:44:27.468 --> 06:44:27.478 align:start position:0%
precludes the landfill or at least uh
 
06:44:30.388 --> 06:44:30.398 align:start position:0%
Narrows the possibility of its sighting
 
06:44:33.150 --> 06:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
the state parks that we just heard about
 
06:44:36.708 --> 06:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
or state parks that are are in or near
 
06:44:38.948 --> 06:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
communities that have
 
06:44:43.948 --> 06:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
chosen chosen not to adopt zoning all
 
06:44:46.310 --> 06:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
right so that's how they have chosen to
 
06:44:48.230 --> 06:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
operate their communities those are the
 
06:44:50.670 --> 06:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
decisions that they've made that's how
 
06:44:53.548 --> 06:44:53.558 align:start position:0%
they want to govern themselves and so
 
06:44:56.230 --> 06:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
when a neighboring Community then says
 
06:44:58.430 --> 06:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
well they don't have zoning and now this
 
06:45:01.628 --> 06:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
is going in and I don't I don't like it
 
06:45:05.310 --> 06:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
to come with basically de facto state
 
06:45:05.320 --> 06:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
to come with basically de facto state
level

06:45:06.310 --> 06:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:45:09.430 --> 06:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
zoning doesn't seem like the doesn't
 
06:45:12.350 --> 06:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
seem like the best approach to solve
 
06:45:16.190 --> 06:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
that problem so um so if a community AB
 
06:45:18.190 --> 06:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
buts another community and and that
 
06:45:19.868 --> 06:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
Community doesn't like the zoning
 
06:45:22.150 --> 06:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
policies of the neighboring Community
 
06:45:24.548 --> 06:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
can they come to the state legislature
 
06:45:27.788 --> 06:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
to to get an RSA that that puts their de
 
06:45:30.990 --> 06:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
facto um zoning into place for other
 
06:45:33.990 --> 06:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
communities I mean I don't think so that
 
06:45:35.990 --> 06:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
those are the analogies of of what we're
 
06:45:37.990 --> 06:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
talking about when we listen to these
 
06:45:39.670 --> 06:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
these points being
 
06:45:43.070 --> 06:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
articulated I live in Deerfield okay I
 
06:45:46.110 --> 06:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
am I am almost AB budding be Brook State
 
06:45:49.270 --> 06:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
Park puer Way state park has property
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know into into Deerfield so do a
 
06:45:54.430 --> 06:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
bear Brook um so so I get I get the
 
06:45:57.510 --> 06:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
value of the state park but to say that
 
06:46:00.788 --> 06:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a TW mile buffer
 
06:46:04.468 --> 06:46:04.478 align:start position:0%
around every state park for a landfill
 
06:46:08.030 --> 06:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
only right what about what about
 
06:46:10.510 --> 06:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
mining what about
 
06:46:13.830 --> 06:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
excavation what about um the development
 
06:46:16.670 --> 06:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
of of particularly tall structures for
 
06:46:16.680 --> 06:46:17.868 align:start position:0%
of of particularly tall structures for
whatever

06:46:17.868 --> 06:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:46:20.030 --> 06:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
reason one of the complaints that we
 
06:46:22.270 --> 06:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
heard you know is noise and runoff at
 
06:46:24.110 --> 06:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake that they feel that that's
 
06:46:25.990 --> 06:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to threaten the state park there's
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
already noise up there when I visited
 
06:46:30.430 --> 06:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
all you could hear was the den of
 
06:46:32.910 --> 06:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles the property in question is
 
06:46:36.110 --> 06:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
currently being managed for um aggregate
 
06:46:38.750 --> 06:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
production right sand and gravel and
 
06:46:41.350 --> 06:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's also being managed for forestry I I
 
06:46:43.830 --> 06:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
drove up as far as I could on the on the
 
06:46:46.388 --> 06:46:46.398 align:start position:0%
property's uh Access Road till I hit the
 
06:46:49.070 --> 06:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
gate and it is quite clear that that
 
06:46:51.270 --> 06:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
property is already being managed for
 
06:46:54.270 --> 06:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
things that bring heavy equipment large
 
06:46:56.910 --> 06:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
trucks in and out perhaps there'll be
 
06:46:58.948 --> 06:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
more trucks with the landfill maybe not
 
06:47:02.510 --> 06:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know um so I I think we need
 
06:47:05.788 --> 06:47:05.798 align:start position:0%
to to keep a lot of these things in mind
 
06:47:07.708 --> 06:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
and and so again it's for all of these
 
06:47:10.590 --> 06:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
reasons combined uh that for me this is
 
06:47:13.310 --> 06:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
I itl and and that's why I'm going to
 
06:47:16.190 --> 06:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
support uh the itl motion thank you Mr
 
06:47:18.910 --> 06:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative uh
 
06:47:20.548 --> 06:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron you haven't had a
 
06:47:22.868 --> 06:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
chance to speak
 
06:47:27.708 --> 06:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
yet thank you very much and I gotta Echo
 
06:47:32.430 --> 06:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
what um chairman Pearl had said about
 
06:47:34.590 --> 06:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
everybody body on this committee having
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
such very valid points and working
 
06:47:40.310 --> 06:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
together and talking and and I I can't
 
06:47:42.750 --> 06:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
say more about how much I appreciate
 
06:47:44.590 --> 06:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
that since I have sat on other
 
06:47:48.110 --> 06:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
committees and it's not like this
 
06:47:52.190 --> 06:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
um that being said I I agree um with the
 
06:47:54.510 --> 06:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
points that representative vervo came up
 
06:47:56.830 --> 06:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
with the the points that representative
 
06:47:59.230 --> 06:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
Balden has come up with all of these
 
06:48:03.830 --> 06:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
points really really they they they
 
06:48:06.510 --> 06:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
ReSound with you know it resonates with
 
06:48:09.430 --> 06:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
me um but what I see with this bill is
 
06:48:10.830 --> 06:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
that it's more or
 
06:48:13.510 --> 06:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
less citing
 
06:48:13.520 --> 06:48:15.548 align:start position:0%
less citing
criteria

06:48:15.548 --> 06:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
06:48:18.548 --> 06:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
and this sighting criteria is made
 
06:48:22.388 --> 06:48:22.398 align:start position:0%
without really any technical proof or
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
technical sense I mean why not three
 
06:48:29.350 --> 06:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
miles five miles 10 miles I mean there's
 
06:48:33.270 --> 06:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
no it just seems too arbitrary for me
 
06:48:35.510 --> 06:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and as well as you know yes let's
 
06:48:37.788 --> 06:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
protect our state parks but what about
 
06:48:40.230 --> 06:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
our national parks our historical sites
 
06:48:43.230 --> 06:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
our tourist areas our recreational rail
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
Trails those are also places where
 
06:48:49.628 --> 06:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
tourists go to where we cherish for our
 
06:48:52.388 --> 06:48:52.398 align:start position:0%
recre for our very limited recreational
 
06:48:56.670 --> 06:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
time these days so I I'm I'm very torn
 
06:49:00.430 --> 06:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
with it but you know I think we also
 
06:49:03.388 --> 06:49:03.398 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the statute
 
06:49:05.868 --> 06:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
statute that we already have that Dees
 
06:49:06.910 --> 06:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
has to
 
06:49:09.430 --> 06:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
follow and maybe we need to do more to
 
06:49:11.990 --> 06:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that they do follow it that
 
06:49:14.910 --> 06:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
says that uh with regard to public
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
benefit requirements for Solid Waste
 
06:49:20.110 --> 06:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
Management that facilities necessary to
 
06:49:22.788 --> 06:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
meet Solid Waste capacity needs must be
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
designed and operated in a manner which
 
06:49:28.628 --> 06:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
will protect the public health and the
 
06:49:31.270 --> 06:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
state's natural environment we've been
 
06:49:33.670 --> 06:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
all talking about the same thing it's
 
06:49:35.070 --> 06:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
06:49:39.030 --> 06:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
statute um we want to meet the capacity
 
06:49:40.788 --> 06:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
needs of the state while minimizing
 
06:49:43.548 --> 06:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
adverse environmental public health and
 
06:49:46.468 --> 06:49:46.478 align:start position:0%
long-term economic impacts it's here in
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
the statutes the department shall also
 
06:49:52.590 --> 06:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
consider as part of its public benefit
 
06:49:54.590 --> 06:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
determination the concerns of the
 
06:49:56.990 --> 06:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
citizens and the governing bodies of the
 
06:49:59.548 --> 06:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
host municipality County and district
 
06:50:02.230 --> 06:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
and other affected persons it's in the
 
06:50:02.240 --> 06:50:03.190 align:start position:0%
and other affected persons it's in the
statute

06:50:03.190 --> 06:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:50:06.670 --> 06:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
so Dees has to take into consideration
 
06:50:09.030 --> 06:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
all of these factors and I hope that
 
06:50:12.548 --> 06:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
they will um and that being said I think
 
06:50:14.910 --> 06:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
that the working group that we discussed
 
06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
prior to this bill will go a long way
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
also to bring about change into how we
 
06:50:27.350 --> 06:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
look at site um consider are the are the
 
06:50:30.270 --> 06:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
landfills and you know we do need the
 
06:50:33.388 --> 06:50:33.398 align:start position:0%
landfill um
 
06:50:38.110 --> 06:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
so I I I have to agree that um this bill
 
06:50:42.788 --> 06:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
does not really do what we want it to do
 
06:50:45.610 --> 06:50:45.620 align:start position:0%
and so I I have to go with itl thank
 
06:50:45.620 --> 06:50:48.750 align:start position:0%
and so I I have to go with itl thank
[Music]

06:50:48.750 --> 06:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:51.270 --> 06:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
 
06:50:53.310 --> 06:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative saakes you have your hand
 
06:50:54.948 --> 06:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
up is that still up or did you have
 
06:50:57.830 --> 06:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
further comments yes sir Mr chairman I
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to just say that
 
06:51:04.070 --> 06:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill has already come before
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
this committee once before and um it was
 
06:51:07.558 --> 06:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
this committee once before and um it was
Bill

06:51:09.030 --> 06:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:51:13.070 --> 06:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
1319 and it was last session so for the
 
06:51:16.230 --> 06:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
argument that um this bill was late to
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
the game um that is incorrect and so um
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to have that on the
 
06:51:26.910 --> 06:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
record thank you representative uh
 
06:51:28.310 --> 06:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you haven't had a
 
06:51:31.030 --> 06:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
chance to speak yet go ahead thank you
 
06:51:33.270 --> 06:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah you know part of the
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're having around
 
06:51:40.628 --> 06:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
um what is best moving forward in citing
 
06:51:43.990 --> 06:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
for all um natural resources around land
 
06:51:47.350 --> 06:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
um state parks um I think is an
 
06:51:49.948 --> 06:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
important consideration about how we
 
06:51:52.150 --> 06:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
proactively move forward additionally I
 
06:51:54.310 --> 06:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
have heard concerns directly from
 
06:51:56.350 --> 06:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
constituents who own property in that
 
06:52:00.030 --> 06:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
area who site concerns around property
 
06:52:02.670 --> 06:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
values of their own properties and I I
 
06:52:05.270 --> 06:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that that is an important also
 
06:52:06.910 --> 06:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
part to consider when we talk about
 
06:52:08.750 --> 06:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
natural resources and we're also talking
 
06:52:10.910 --> 06:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
about the use of the state parks in the
 
06:52:13.990 --> 06:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
environment so I think this is a broader
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
issue in my than just for this one
 
06:52:20.830 --> 06:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
Community I think this is we would be
 
06:52:23.868 --> 06:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
potentially setting precedent for years
 
06:52:23.878 --> 06:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
potentially setting precedent for years
to

06:52:26.150 --> 06:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:30.070 --> 06:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
come thank you uh representative Duty uh
 
06:52:32.628 --> 06:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I just want to
 
06:52:34.830 --> 06:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
comment on uh some of the statements
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
made about arbitrariness you know
 
06:52:39.430 --> 06:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the two miles uh I think in
 
06:52:43.110 --> 06:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
statute we have a number of um
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
situations that mimic this exactly I
 
06:52:47.868 --> 06:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
don't know all of them but I know
 
06:52:51.788 --> 06:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
regarding Wetlands uh we in I believe
 
06:52:54.990 --> 06:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
the state law uh is a wetland boundary
 
06:52:58.110 --> 06:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
is uh 100 feet and I think the the
 
06:53:00.190 --> 06:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
cities and the towns can change it I
 
06:53:03.150 --> 06:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
know in Nashville we have a critical um
 
06:53:06.190 --> 06:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
we have a prime wet lens of 75 feet and
 
06:53:09.430 --> 06:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
a critical wet lens of 40 feet arbitrary
 
06:53:11.190 --> 06:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
I mean there's no science based on
 
06:53:13.670 --> 06:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
exactly why that should be so I think we
 
06:53:16.990 --> 06:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
already have it in State Statute that um
 
06:53:18.990 --> 06:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
you know there are areas that are marked
 
06:53:22.310 --> 06:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
out and it's an arbitrary er um an
 
06:53:25.868 --> 06:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number just because you know
 
06:53:29.310 --> 06:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
it it seemed to be right at the time um
 
06:53:31.548 --> 06:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm really not concerned about
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I mean you have to pick out a
 
06:53:35.910 --> 06:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
number and and people talk about it and
 
06:53:38.310 --> 06:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
they think about it it's it's just like
 
06:53:41.750 --> 06:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
HB 272 why did we choose
 
06:53:45.110 --> 06:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
$250 for a registration fee well you
 
06:53:47.310 --> 06:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
know we talked this person that person
 
06:53:49.750 --> 06:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know Dilly dallad around about it
 
06:53:51.830 --> 06:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
and said that seemed to be reasonable
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that's we have that in
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
statute over and over and over again so
 
06:53:59.110 --> 06:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're cutting any new
 
06:54:01.430 --> 06:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
ground if we go ahead and pass this bill
 
06:54:04.388 --> 06:54:04.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:08.670 --> 06:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
liit representative representative B uh
 
06:54:11.830 --> 06:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm I'm a little
 
06:54:13.830 --> 06:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
surprised at some of the stuff I'm I'm
 
06:54:16.948 --> 06:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
hearing um I I've heard comments that
 
06:54:19.990 --> 06:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
are state parks they aren't that
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
great what message does that send to
 
06:54:24.628 --> 06:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
visitors Silver
 
06:54:27.270 --> 06:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
Lake Puck away they have they have
 
06:54:28.670 --> 06:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
issues sometime we have to shut them
 
06:54:30.948 --> 06:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
down because of bacteria let's just
 
06:54:32.910 --> 06:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
build a mountain of trash next to what
 
06:54:34.590 --> 06:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
message does that send and what kind of
 
06:54:36.388 --> 06:54:36.398 align:start position:0%
solution is that that doesn't make sense
 
06:54:39.788 --> 06:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:39.798 --> 06:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
sense

06:54:41.910 --> 06:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
06:54:44.310 --> 06:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
well representative I'm not sure where
 
06:54:46.110 --> 06:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
you heard that comment because I did not
 
06:54:48.110 --> 06:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
hear that comment that anyone disparaged
 
06:54:49.910 --> 06:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
their state parks I I think the comment
 
06:54:51.388 --> 06:54:51.398 align:start position:0%
was more related to something that
 
06:54:53.990 --> 06:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative H discussed about that
 
06:54:56.948 --> 06:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
not all things are are as pristine as
 
06:54:58.350 --> 06:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
we're always saying there I think that
 
06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
was more of a comment but I I appreciate
 
06:55:03.628 --> 06:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
and understand what you're saying
 
06:55:05.350 --> 06:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
is there any further com representative
 
06:55:07.388 --> 06:55:07.398 align:start position:0%
Dy did you have another comment well I
 
06:55:09.030 --> 06:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
just want to make one comment and that's
 
06:55:11.830 --> 06:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what other people have said
 
06:55:14.670 --> 06:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh it is very enjoyable to be able to
 
06:55:18.590 --> 06:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
engage in a policy discussion where we
 
06:55:21.910 --> 06:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
have differences of opinion you know but
 
06:55:24.110 --> 06:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to do the best for the
 
06:55:26.388 --> 06:55:26.398 align:start position:0%
state and I think there are very few
 
06:55:29.430 --> 06:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
committees uh in which we can do this
 
06:55:31.990 --> 06:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
and I want you to know that how much I
 
06:55:34.548 --> 06:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
ALS so appreciate this thank you
 
06:55:38.468 --> 06:55:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:41.468 --> 06:55:41.478 align:start position:0%
Perez yeah I want to Echo that to be
 
06:55:44.750 --> 06:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
honest of me coming from the minority
 
06:55:46.750 --> 06:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
group and then this is the first time
 
06:55:49.150 --> 06:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm a state representative I
 
06:55:52.110 --> 06:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
feel so welcoming in this committee and
 
06:55:53.750 --> 06:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
I feel like I
 
06:55:56.788 --> 06:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
can I can use my voice and I can be he
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
and like with all the respect we all
 
06:56:03.270 --> 06:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
respect each other and then um
 
06:56:06.350 --> 06:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this bill to be honest
 
06:56:09.548 --> 06:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
we have an amazing State we have an
 
06:56:12.750 --> 06:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
amazing parks and I'm I'm only not
 
06:56:15.830 --> 06:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
seeing just for this generation but with
 
06:56:19.708 --> 06:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
it you know for the next Generations and
 
06:56:21.868 --> 06:56:21.878 align:start position:0%
I have so many so many friends and so
 
06:56:24.270 --> 06:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
many family members that come from all
 
06:56:28.628 --> 06:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
around the world and then I I have that
 
06:56:30.468 --> 06:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
privilege to tell them you know that we
 
06:56:33.350 --> 06:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
have such a beautiful stay
 
06:56:36.388 --> 06:56:36.398 align:start position:0%
and I would love to protect the parks
 
06:56:37.948 --> 06:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
06:56:41.948 --> 06:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
I I don't want then to bring trash from
 
06:56:43.948 --> 06:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
out State we have enough problem with
 
06:56:46.310 --> 06:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
our trash why are we going to allow more
 
06:56:49.030 --> 06:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
trash to come into our state we already
 
06:56:50.548 --> 06:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
have issues with water being
 
06:56:52.628 --> 06:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
contaminated the air is
 
06:56:52.638 --> 06:56:55.350 align:start position:0%
contaminated the air is
contaminated

06:56:55.350 --> 06:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
um I you know I I see this as something
 
06:57:03.750 --> 06:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we can like work as a committee and
 
06:57:05.868 --> 06:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
with all my respect I will ask you to
 
06:57:09.030 --> 06:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill because we need to we
 
06:57:11.548 --> 06:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
we need to protect and this is not a
 
06:57:13.910 --> 06:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is not about one project this is
 
06:57:16.468 --> 06:57:16.478 align:start position:0%
about you know everything that so
 
06:57:19.150 --> 06:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
beautiful in our state thank you
 
06:57:21.388 --> 06:57:21.398 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative
 
06:57:25.270 --> 06:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
staple well thank you Mr chair
 
06:57:29.150 --> 06:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I I'm going to go with supporting the
 
06:57:32.230 --> 06:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
itl but
 
06:57:34.868 --> 06:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the bills intent and the
 
06:57:37.030 --> 06:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
plights of the land
 
06:57:41.270 --> 06:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
owners and I really appreciate um
 
06:57:44.510 --> 06:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative wen's testimony earlier
 
06:57:47.788 --> 06:57:47.798 align:start position:0%
on with interesting information about
 
06:57:49.910 --> 06:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
buffers at different
 
06:57:52.708 --> 06:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
states um the only question I would have
 
06:57:56.388 --> 06:57:56.398 align:start position:0%
to satisfy myself would be uh what the
 
06:57:59.270 --> 06:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
details of those laws are if there was
 
06:58:02.190 --> 06:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
any other measuring criteria other than
 
06:58:03.750 --> 06:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
raw number
 
06:58:07.750 --> 06:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
buffer and that's my problem with uh
 
06:58:10.750 --> 06:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
this bill it's we're closing the Barn
 
06:58:13.430 --> 06:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
Door after the horse is rushing out or
 
06:58:15.910 --> 06:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
maybe while it's rushing
 
06:58:19.350 --> 06:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
out another expression devil in the
 
06:58:22.510 --> 06:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
details or lack
 
06:58:26.110 --> 06:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
thereof um I would think that a bill
 
06:58:28.548 --> 06:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
would be better suited to advisory
 
06:58:30.388 --> 06:58:30.398 align:start position:0%
criteria to
 
06:58:33.110 --> 06:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
Dees and ask some of
 
06:58:37.030 --> 06:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
zoning not only um with the groundwater
 
06:58:41.230 --> 06:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
issue but you know line of sight
 
06:58:44.270 --> 06:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics uh green barriers like that
 
06:58:47.548 --> 06:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
have been utilized in other areas and
 
06:58:47.558 --> 06:58:48.868 align:start position:0%
have been utilized in other areas and
other

06:58:48.868 --> 06:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:58:53.990 --> 06:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
states that preserve atics and sight
 
06:58:57.670 --> 06:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
deter wind transmission of
 
06:59:02.190 --> 06:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
odors dampen sound from machine
 
06:59:05.150 --> 06:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
operations of recycling
 
06:59:08.830 --> 06:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
centers um as well as the groundwater
 
06:59:13.230 --> 06:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
considerations and uh probably some many
 
06:59:16.110 --> 06:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
other things that could go into
 
06:59:16.120 --> 06:59:17.708 align:start position:0%
other things that could go into
measuring

06:59:17.708 --> 06:59:17.718 align:start position:0%
measuring
 
06:59:20.590 --> 06:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
criteria um the raw number doesn't do it
 
06:59:20.600 --> 06:59:21.388 align:start position:0%
criteria um the raw number doesn't do it
for

06:59:21.388 --> 06:59:21.398 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:59:25.150 --> 06:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
me um it should be two miles maybe it
 
06:59:27.190 --> 06:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
should be one mile maybe it should be
 
06:59:29.868 --> 06:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
three or six miles but that's dependent
 
06:59:32.510 --> 06:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
upon Case by case where the site is in
 
06:59:32.520 --> 06:59:33.628 align:start position:0%
upon Case by case where the site is in
the

06:59:33.628 --> 06:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:59:36.388 --> 06:59:36.398 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so I think the bill
 
06:59:39.468 --> 06:59:39.478 align:start position:0%
fall short as as much as I sympathize
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
with its intent and and grieve for the
 
06:59:45.468 --> 06:59:45.478 align:start position:0%
the land owners and the neighbors who
 
06:59:49.030 --> 06:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
feel grieved about having a d sighted in
 
06:59:49.040 --> 06:59:50.388 align:start position:0%
feel grieved about having a d sighted in
their

06:59:50.388 --> 06:59:50.398 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:59:53.150 --> 06:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um I would I would
 
06:59:55.990 --> 06:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
encourage a better bill with more uh
 
07:00:00.590 --> 07:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
detail and uh advisory criteria to the
 
07:00:03.628 --> 07:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
dees and so I'm going to support the
 
07:00:07.110 --> 07:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
itm thank you pres well folks we've had
 
07:00:09.948 --> 07:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
about an hour of discussion on this um
 
07:00:11.948 --> 07:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
we're not really hearing any new points
 
07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh I'll continue on as long as you want
 
07:00:15.030 --> 07:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
to I'll just remind you that we do have
 
07:00:18.150 --> 07:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
a few more bills we need to exact so um
 
07:00:20.868 --> 07:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan you have your hand
 
07:00:23.628 --> 07:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
up yeah I just want to add one more uh
 
07:00:25.750 --> 07:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
point of view and that's uh the fact
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
that if we go ahead with iing this bill
 
07:00:31.110 --> 07:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
that would be in the face of uh what's
 
07:00:33.910 --> 07:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing amount of public support
 
07:00:36.190 --> 07:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
for this bill especially from people in
 
07:00:37.990 --> 07:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
the in the local area and I think that
 
07:00:41.150 --> 07:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
it would it would be seen as kind of uh
 
07:00:43.590 --> 07:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
um arrogant of us to just discount that
 
07:00:46.628 --> 07:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
and and itl this bill given some kind of
 
07:00:48.990 --> 07:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
vague notion that it's not specific
 
07:00:50.350 --> 07:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
enough or not detailed enough
 
07:00:51.910 --> 07:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
scientifically especially given what we
 
07:00:54.990 --> 07:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
know about the lack of uh the lack of
 
07:00:57.030 --> 07:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
capacity in in the dees for doing that
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
kind of strategic analysis and the fact
 
07:01:00.628 --> 07:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
that you know this would be a good time
 
07:01:04.230 --> 07:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
to pause and and and and allow us to
 
07:01:06.388 --> 07:01:06.398 align:start position:0%
catch up to where we are in terms of
 
07:01:08.350 --> 07:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with the solid waste problem
 
07:01:11.510 --> 07:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
before we rush ahead with a project that
 
07:01:13.590 --> 07:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
is very very you
 
07:01:16.510 --> 07:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
unpopular so that's that's all I'm
 
07:01:18.510 --> 07:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
saying thank you representative
 
07:01:23.230 --> 07:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative Kor thank you Mr chair um
 
07:01:25.350 --> 07:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
I appreciate and respect everyone's
 
07:01:27.990 --> 07:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
testimony here today and what they're
 
07:01:30.430 --> 07:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
saying and your
 
07:01:33.270 --> 07:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
opinions the one thing that I fall back
 
07:01:36.388 --> 07:01:36.398 align:start position:0%
on is yes we've had issues in the state
 
07:01:38.628 --> 07:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
represent B mention
 
07:01:42.070 --> 07:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
cly had those issues but I think that
 
07:01:45.070 --> 07:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
Dees in moving forward and with new
 
07:01:47.868 --> 07:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
technologies has managed those issues
 
07:01:49.868 --> 07:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
and is very
 
07:01:52.548 --> 07:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
cognizant that these happened in the
 
07:01:56.670 --> 07:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
past and will be doubly sure that they
 
07:01:59.230 --> 07:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
won't happen again I mean there already
 
07:02:02.070 --> 07:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
change there's things that didn't happen
 
07:02:04.388 --> 07:02:04.398 align:start position:0%
previous landfills that are happening in
 
07:02:07.628 --> 07:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
this one just by the design of it I
 
07:02:10.070 --> 07:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
think that we have a Department of
 
07:02:13.150 --> 07:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and we have a
 
07:02:15.110 --> 07:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner who is very aware of our
 
07:02:18.788 --> 07:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
natural resources that we are a tourist
 
07:02:22.788 --> 07:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
State and again this is a zoning issue
 
07:02:24.868 --> 07:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to look to them in
 
07:02:27.310 --> 07:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
their guidance and their
 
07:02:29.190 --> 07:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
expertise they are not going to
 
07:02:31.230 --> 07:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
jeopardize our natural resources it's
 
07:02:34.788 --> 07:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
stated right the RSA they cannot and I
 
07:02:36.990 --> 07:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
think that moving you
 
07:02:39.590 --> 07:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
know nobody wants to have a landfill in
 
07:02:41.750 --> 07:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
their backyard I mean I'm just going to
 
07:02:44.388 --> 07:02:44.398 align:start position:0%
say it
 
07:02:44.398 --> 07:02:45.910 align:start position:0%
say it
but

07:02:45.910 --> 07:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:02:48.310 --> 07:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
EnV is determined that this is a
 
07:02:48.320 --> 07:02:49.628 align:start position:0%
EnV is determined that this is a
suitable

07:02:49.628 --> 07:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
suitable
 
07:02:52.548 --> 07:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
site it just happens to
 
07:02:56.430 --> 07:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
be in in the town of Dalton where in
 
07:02:59.310 --> 07:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
near State Park if this was somewhere
 
07:03:00.708 --> 07:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
else would we be having the same
 
07:03:04.388 --> 07:03:04.398 align:start position:0%
discussion I would venture to say yes so
 
07:03:05.948 --> 07:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think I'd like a
 
07:03:07.190 --> 07:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
point of clarification there
 
07:03:08.910 --> 07:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative PTO I I don't believe
 
07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh the dees has made that
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
determination yet that it's suitable I
 
07:03:15.190 --> 07:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
believe they're still accepting the
 
07:03:18.628 --> 07:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
application oh well Mr chair thank you
 
07:03:20.910 --> 07:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
for that but I may I just say something
 
07:03:23.110 --> 07:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
that if they do accept the
 
07:03:25.628 --> 07:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
application then they then I believe
 
07:03:27.708 --> 07:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
they would have done their due diligence
 
07:03:31.548 --> 07:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
sure I apologize for I think just about
 
07:03:33.230 --> 07:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
all all of us has had a chance to speak
 
07:03:35.708 --> 07:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
except representative Bixby and now he's
 
07:03:37.788 --> 07:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
he's got his hand back up again so I if
 
07:03:39.110 --> 07:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
you're all okay with it I think I'm
 
07:03:40.670 --> 07:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
going to let representative viby speak
 
07:03:41.868 --> 07:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
and then we'll put this to a vote
 
07:03:44.190 --> 07:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
because we've been quite a while here
 
07:03:47.548 --> 07:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I um I'm going to be voting against
 
07:03:51.548 --> 07:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
the itl because um I feel strongly that
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
we should be defending our state parks
 
07:03:59.590 --> 07:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh and that the um the state parks are
 
07:04:02.150 --> 07:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
really one of the major drivers of our
 
07:04:04.990 --> 07:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
touristry industry and there are a lot
 
07:04:07.788 --> 07:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
of small businesses that depend on those
 
07:04:11.990 --> 07:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
state parks to uh you to provide their
 
07:04:16.030 --> 07:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
customer base and uh the sighting of a
 
07:04:18.110 --> 07:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
landfill right next to a state park
 
07:04:21.590 --> 07:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be a uh would diminish the value
 
07:04:24.150 --> 07:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
of that Park we do have a lot of other
 
07:04:27.070 --> 07:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
land in the state that is not within two
 
07:04:30.990 --> 07:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
miles of a state park and uh that is you
 
07:04:33.190 --> 07:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
know available you know with the same
 
07:04:35.510 --> 07:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
due diligence that Dees will give for
 
07:04:39.830 --> 07:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
any sighting uh uh issue uh that is
 
07:04:42.468 --> 07:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
available for development as a landfill
 
07:04:45.388 --> 07:04:45.398 align:start position:0%
or other businesses as as long as they
 
07:04:49.388 --> 07:04:49.398 align:start position:0%
meet the sighting um the permitting
 
07:04:52.830 --> 07:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
requirement so I think that making that
 
07:04:55.468 --> 07:04:55.478 align:start position:0%
two mile around a state park cutout is
 
07:04:57.590 --> 07:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way of defending our
 
07:04:59.350 --> 07:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
state parks thank
 
07:05:02.150 --> 07:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative I just have
 
07:05:03.628 --> 07:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
a procedural question just so I
 
07:05:05.830 --> 07:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
understand if I could go ahead
 
07:05:08.708 --> 07:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative B um well I I just one of
 
07:05:10.230 --> 07:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
the things I want to mention was that I
 
07:05:11.708 --> 07:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative Kaplan
 
07:05:13.190 --> 07:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that the blue sheet was
 
07:05:16.788 --> 07:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
335 to 33 but the uh the procedural
 
07:05:19.910 --> 07:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
question I had was that um I have an
 
07:05:21.628 --> 07:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
amendment put together for this bill and
 
07:05:23.868 --> 07:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since we've had
 
07:05:25.030 --> 07:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
something like this and I just want to
 
07:05:27.110 --> 07:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
make sure I I understand would we have
 
07:05:29.750 --> 07:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
to defeat the it
 
07:05:32.590 --> 07:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
motion before we could talk about about
 
07:05:33.750 --> 07:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
any Amendment to the bill is that
 
07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct thank you very I
 
07:05:38.070 --> 07:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure myself so I checked with the
 
07:05:39.628 --> 07:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
clerk today because I wanted to make
 
07:05:41.548 --> 07:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
sure procedurally I handled this well so
 
07:05:44.430 --> 07:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
that I was giving your Amendment uh the
 
07:05:45.948 --> 07:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
due process that it deserves but he
 
07:05:47.430 --> 07:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
informed me if we have an itl on the
 
07:05:49.388 --> 07:05:49.398 align:start position:0%
table then we have to you would have to
 
07:05:50.948 --> 07:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
defeat that because you can't amend an
 
07:05:52.708 --> 07:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
itl motion great thanks you so much

seconded by representative F and I will
 
07:08:06.750 --> 07:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
recognize rep representative Bixby to
 
07:08:07.990 --> 07:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
speak to his
 
07:08:10.708 --> 07:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
board okay and I just have a couple of
 
07:08:14.190 --> 07:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
notes Here I want to bring up um okay so
 
07:08:17.548 --> 07:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
um so I'm speaking to the amendment
 
07:08:20.310 --> 07:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
specifically uh what um I worked on the
 
07:08:23.830 --> 07:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
amendment with representative Homa and
 
07:08:27.310 --> 07:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh and she was very helpful in terms of
 
07:08:29.990 --> 07:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh helping iron out some uh some of the
 
07:08:32.110 --> 07:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
weaker points and helping me make them
 
07:08:37.270 --> 07:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
much stronger so uh the uh one thing
 
07:08:39.270 --> 07:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
that uh has been changed throughout is
 
07:08:44.030 --> 07:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
the uh origin the bists um as introduced
 
07:08:46.830 --> 07:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
had the phrase uh climate change and
 
07:08:49.430 --> 07:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
environmental change and that's changed
 
07:08:52.590 --> 07:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
throughout as uh changing environment
 
07:08:54.990 --> 07:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
and climate or claiming changing climate
 
07:08:57.230 --> 07:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
and environment or changes in climate
 
07:08:59.750 --> 07:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
and environment depending on the wording
 
07:08:59.760 --> 07:09:01.628 align:start position:0%
and environment depending on the wording
context

07:09:01.628 --> 07:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
context
 
07:09:06.110 --> 07:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh the uh there was a some question
 
07:09:08.310 --> 07:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
about how the word mitigation was being
 
07:09:11.910 --> 07:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
used and I decided that um based on
 
07:09:16.070 --> 07:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh Roger Nunan uh who
 
07:09:18.830 --> 07:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
helped me draft the the original Bill uh
 
07:09:20.990 --> 07:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
it actually didn't make sense in the
 
07:09:22.868 --> 07:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
context of New Hampshire to have the
 
07:09:24.788 --> 07:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
term mitigation and it actually just
 
07:09:27.310 --> 07:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
create created more confusion so the
 
07:09:31.468 --> 07:09:31.478 align:start position:0%
term mitigation has been removed uh I uh
 
07:09:34.670 --> 07:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
changed the def the definition of
 
07:09:38.388 --> 07:09:38.398 align:start position:0%
adaptation to remove the phrase climate
 
07:09:41.030 --> 07:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
change and environmental change so it's
 
07:09:44.230 --> 07:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
a cleaner definition of the word
 
07:09:47.388 --> 07:09:47.398 align:start position:0%
adaptation and uh at representative
 
07:09:51.388 --> 07:09:51.398 align:start position:0%
homa's suggestion I have uh included uh
 
07:09:55.510 --> 07:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
more emphasis on drought resilience so
 
07:09:58.270 --> 07:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's what um what the
 
07:10:01.670 --> 07:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
07:10:02.910 --> 07:10:02.920 align:start position:0%

okay I was going to discuss the report
 
07:15:29.830 --> 07:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
deadlines but while she's getting ready
 
07:15:31.990 --> 07:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'll do that for
 
07:15:33.430 --> 07:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
well I'm
 
07:15:37.788 --> 07:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
still so any any minority reports or uh
 
07:15:40.110 --> 07:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
the folks who doing the majority reports
 
07:15:41.548 --> 07:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to need to have you get those
 
07:15:42.628 --> 07:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
Into Me
 
07:15:45.948 --> 07:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
Tomorrow by I think by noon is okay but
 
07:15:47.868 --> 07:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
the earlier the better so that I have a
 
07:15:49.310 --> 07:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
chance to approve them and get back to
 
07:15:51.310 --> 07:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
you if there's any concerns sure so the
 
07:15:53.230 --> 07:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
earlier the better I have to get them in
 
07:15:55.270 --> 07:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
place by tomorrow I believe it's 4M is
 
07:15:58.548 --> 07:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
my deadline okay and I'm just follow um
 
07:16:01.750 --> 07:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
can I'm curious can Minority Report
 
07:16:03.468 --> 07:16:03.478 align:start position:0%
include an amendment or can it not
 
07:16:05.388 --> 07:16:05.398 align:start position:0%
because we never discuss the
 
07:16:07.388 --> 07:16:07.398 align:start position:0%
amendment that I don't know the answer
 
07:16:10.590 --> 07:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
to but I will inquire okay I can I can
 
07:16:12.708 --> 07:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
answer I can provide an answer to that
 
07:16:15.990 --> 07:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
so uh The Minority Report report
 
07:16:18.270 --> 07:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
requires that you say the motion that
 
07:16:21.628 --> 07:16:21.638 align:start position:0%
you would have wanted so you can say so
 
07:16:23.310 --> 07:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
you would say that the motion that you
 
07:16:26.868 --> 07:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
that you would have wanted was the otpa
 
07:16:29.830 --> 07:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the the amendment number that you
 
07:16:31.750 --> 07:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
would have wanted okay then that
 
07:16:33.750 --> 07:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment number that amendment can get
 
07:16:37.230 --> 07:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
the calendar correct and and the so the
 
07:16:38.910 --> 07:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment number doesn't doesn't
 
07:16:41.788 --> 07:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
actually appear in the calendar but uh
 
07:16:44.468 --> 07:16:44.478 align:start position:0%
nor does the nor does the unless you
 
07:16:47.310 --> 07:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
include it in your text no nor does the
 
07:16:50.510 --> 07:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
the the otpa but you but in your
 
07:16:52.628 --> 07:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
Minority Report you could have said you
 
07:16:56.070 --> 07:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
could say the the more minority felt
 
07:16:58.350 --> 07:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
that we needed that that this should
 
07:17:01.910 --> 07:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
have been uh passed with an amendment to
 
07:17:05.468 --> 07:17:05.478 align:start position:0%
do such and such gotta okay I'll double
 
07:17:06.750 --> 07:17:06.760 align:start position:0%

07:31:56.430 --> 07:31:56.440 align:start position:0%

get all of our committee reports in in
 
07:32:08.350 --> 07:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
time I'm not positive that uh HB uh 177
 
07:32:09.868 --> 07:32:09.878 align:start position:0%
will be only because I know there's a
 
07:32:11.308 --> 07:32:11.318 align:start position:0%
lot of bills already on the calendar and
 
07:32:12.628 --> 07:32:12.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure if it will make it
 
07:32:14.750 --> 07:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
on or not but I'm certainly going to try
 
07:32:17.030 --> 07:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
because I I think we've done a great job
 
07:32:18.308 --> 07:32:18.318 align:start position:0%
on it and I want to get it to the floor
 
07:32:20.830 --> 07:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
