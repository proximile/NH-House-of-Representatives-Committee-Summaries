okay on the motion about the pass as
amended

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think you need a motion

i don't i don't think you need a motion
to

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
we have already amended
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
so an ocean motion of ought to pass as
 
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.190 align:start position:0%
so an ocean motion of ought to pass as
amended

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair

mr chair
yes

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
just in speaking to my motion from
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
originally this is a very smart bill
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary program that
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
importantly lets car top boat owners
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
share in the cost of making sure that
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
our boat launches are maintained not
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
just putting the reliance on boat owners
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
who pay for repairs and maintenance
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
through their registration but allows
 
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
through their registration but allows
voluntarily

00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
canoers and kayakers to support the
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our boat launches and our
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
car tops and we think that helps build a
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
community of those who love the water
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the motion
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative smith yeah thank you mr
 
00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
representative smith yeah thank you mr
chair

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.950 align:start position:0%
chair
this

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill has come as the result of a lot of
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
work by a lot of people over the years
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.950 align:start position:0%
to try to
encourage

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
some payment
 
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.669 align:start position:0%
some payment
by

00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
those who use our state's waters and our
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
boat accesses our car top accesses
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
and have non-motorized uh boats usually
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
kayaks canoes
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
paddle boards
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
and this being a volunteer program based
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
on a similarity to the hike safe program
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
which is raising more money than a fish
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
and game at first thought it ever would
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
i think is a good step
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
without requiring
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
payment but through voluntary donations
 
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.669 align:start position:0%
payment but through voluntary donations
to

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
help improve our public water access
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%

this and as des has
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
told us
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
and stated the studies are going on on
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing on this that i think we should
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
let them do their job and let the
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%

gather a lot by putting this into
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
interim study because of the emerging
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%

with anyone second the motion
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative smith yes thank you mr
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
house bill 1641 would change the way
 
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.389 align:start position:0%
house bill 1641 would change the way
that

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:37.830 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
vessels boats on our waterways
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
pay their registration
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
and this formula change
 
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
and this formula change
would

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
mean that if you were
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
owned and bought a new
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft slash jet ski and
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
paid fifteen thousand dollars for it
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
your registration fee would go from
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
twenty four dollars a year to two
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy dollars a year and
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
if you bought a new pontoon boat for
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars and your current
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
registration fee is 52 dollars it would
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
go up to over a thousand dollars for the
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
first year and then uh incrementally go
 
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.710 align:start position:0%
first year and then uh incrementally go
down

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
age of the boat
 
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.430 align:start position:0%
age of the boat
and

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
although our
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
registration fees are fairly low
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh this is a huge jump so although
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
there is definitely room to increase our
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
vessel registration fees
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
this this is a little it needs a lot
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
more work this bill is not ready for
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
prime time however on the other hand we
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
heard from captain dunleavy at marine
 
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.830 align:start position:0%
heard from captain dunleavy at marine
patrol

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
patrol
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
that because our registration fee is
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
separate from the add-ons the money that
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
goes to fish and game the money that
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
goes to protect our lakes from aquatic
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
invasive species and and plants
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government is asking and
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
requiring us to
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
integrate this into one registration fee
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
fees the add-on fees not being separated
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
from registration so i
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
made the motion for interim study so
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee could work on this
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
and try to
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
assist marine patrol in getting to a
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
point that possibly we can come up with
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that will be introduced next
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
year that will help the marine patrol
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
to actually get this job done and get
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%

02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
edition
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see it keeps much of the same
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
text as above
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
all it does is it just changes the
 
02:12:24.719 --> 02:12:25.830 align:start position:0%
all it does is it just changes the
wording

02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
wording
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative body the town meetings
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
to make the judgment and the
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and not the uh
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen for those specific
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh those specific roads
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
and that's my testimony on this
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
fairly simple
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh wrong
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a clarification
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative zulo on line 22
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
um it says uh
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
except for the case of an emergency
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
closure by a vote of the legislative
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
body i'm assuming that's still a
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the legislative body
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:13:32.079 --> 02:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:34.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would change it so the select
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
board do not make the final decision
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
but there's still the public hearing and
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
there i mean there's still the public
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
hearing prior to the vote
 
02:13:45.599 --> 02:13:46.709 align:start position:0%
hearing prior to the vote
and

02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
would the same process be used to
 
02:13:50.159 --> 02:13:51.750 align:start position:0%
would the same process be used to
reverse

02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
reverse
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
the decision if a town did allow
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
ohrv use on the class five and classics
 
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
roads that they would the the
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
legislative body would have to
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh pass the uh to reclose
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
the road again yeah yes right it's it's
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually is a it
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
does mimic
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
where and it's it says
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
such town or city
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
authorities may change the allowable
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
highway by ohrv use by giving
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
notification to the supervisor of the
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
both no longer apply but yes it does uh
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
say the
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%

02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.390 align:start position:0%
still by the vote of the legislative
body

02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%

02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1109
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
predominantly the legislation would
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
create an imbalance between the process
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
of opening and closing class 5 and 6
 
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:11.669 align:start position:0%
of opening and closing class 5 and 6
roads

02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%

02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
current role i spent 15 years as the

trails bureau chief for the department
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
of natural resources i left that
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
position in 2020
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
i've been before this committee
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
for 15 years
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
working on ohrv legislation
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
and this topic has come up time and time
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
again in 2019
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature passed house bill 591
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
which added the provisions of a duly
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
noticed public hearing advertised at
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
least 14 days in advance in a public
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
location in the city or town
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
and notification to a butters by
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
verified mail to the process by which a
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
town or city
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
used to open up their class five or six
 
02:16:52.559 --> 02:16:53.509 align:start position:0%
used to open up their class five or six
roads

02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
roads
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
um that process has been in place for a
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
little over a year and where it's being
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
utilized appears to be working
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
so the system we think isn't broken and
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
we don't feel a need for a fix
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
we do also have concerns
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
in this section of the legis legislation
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
that on line 18
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill you'll notice that it says
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 21
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
53 a city or town may authorize the use
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
of class 5 and 6 highways however on
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
line 25 and that's to open
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
these roads you would have to go to the
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the city or town would authorize
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
however on line 24
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the same statute such city
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
or town authorities
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
may take that authority away
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
so we believe this actually requires a
 
02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:44.389 align:start position:0%
so we believe this actually requires a
legislative

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
act whether it's sb2 voting or a town
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
meeting to open roads but that the town
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
select boards still would have the
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
authority just to close it without the
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
same process
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
so with that i would conclude my
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and say that respectfully the
 
02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire off-highway vehicle
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%

02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%

02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
front of me for house bill 1109 is there
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%

ohrvs will definitely tell you the
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
system is broken and that
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%

um before they're turned into ohrv
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
trails and
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
the legislative body should be involved
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be up to two of three
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
selectmen and i'd also like to point out
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%

teeth they need
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%

sovereign immunity
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the town immunity
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
which means that when it comes to where
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
you put atvs
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the bureau of trails doesn't have to
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
follow the law
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
and a town doesn't have to follow the

law
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%

liability for damages caused by ohrv use
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
of class six roads
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
in other words if the board of selectmen
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
allows recreational vehicular use
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
and a member of saying recreational
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
vehicular use
 
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
on a class six road in the town we'll
 
02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
have to fix the damage done
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
to the road
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay why is this an issue
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
the committee has received complaints in
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
the recent past where boards of
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
selectmen have authorized the use
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the class six roads
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
by off
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
off highway
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles now a class six
 
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
road is not maintained by the town
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
so residents who live on these roads
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
are unhappy
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
because the high intensity use of cloud
 
02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
class six roads by these off highway
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles damages the road
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the residents on the road have to
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
repair the road themselves
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
is only right and equitable
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
that if the town
 
02:54:34.389 --> 02:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
if the board of selectmen creates a
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
situation that damages
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
some town citizens the town should make
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
them whole again
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
now let's
 
02:54:45.510 --> 02:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
whack a few of the what ifs or the what
 
02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:46.790 align:start position:0%
whack a few of the what ifs or the what
abouts

02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
abouts
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen
 
02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:49.910 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen
when

02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's a town road you can't stop people
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
from traveling on it
 
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
you're not using the road for
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
transportation you're using the road for
 
02:55:05.359 --> 02:55:07.910 align:start position:0%
transportation you're using the road for
transportation

02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
not recreation
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the police aren't stupid if they
 
02:55:15.750 --> 02:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
spot someone they can they can tell
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
or going over the mountain to the store
 
02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
to pick up a loaf of bread
 
02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
versus somebody who's freewheeling and
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
spinning and grinning around the area
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's different it's
 
02:55:28.389 --> 02:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:55:31.630 --> 02:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
it again it's for the issue is the
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
not the the
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh not the transportational use of the
 
02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:41.429 align:start position:0%
uh not the transportational use of the
road

02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
well uh what about people on the class 6
 
02:55:47.190 --> 02:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
road who have ohrvs
 
02:55:49.269 --> 02:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
so what
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
if they tear up the road they'll have to
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
be the ones to fix it if the board of
 
02:55:56.550 --> 02:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
selectmen do not
 
02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:57.590 align:start position:0%
selectmen do not
invite

02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
invite
 
02:55:59.830 --> 02:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
the in the rest of the world to bring
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
their ohrv's that's the issue and so the
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
town would not be liable if they don't
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:56:11.110 --> 02:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
if they don't allow
 
02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
people from outside the areas
 
02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
to use their ohrvs on those roads
 
02:56:21.269 --> 02:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
the idea is to disincentivize
 
02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
the board of selectmen
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
from inviting in the rest of the world's
 
02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.990 align:start position:0%
from inviting in the rest of the world's
ohrv's

02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
ohrv's
 
02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.309 --> 02:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
i don't have much else to say
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
for representative renzullo
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman mr chairman um
 
02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
if the town
 
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
pays for the damage on a class 6 road
 
02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
that they had authorized people to go on
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
does that change the classification that
 
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
road from a class 6 to a class 5 since
 
02:57:03.429 --> 02:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
they are now
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
spending money on that road
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
i have heard that
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
i have not seen a
 
02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:10.530 align:start position:0%
i have not seen a
uh

02:57:10.530 --> 02:57:10.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:10.540 --> 02:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
i have not seen a uh
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
a statue to that effect i mean
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
i have but i have looked i haven't found
 
02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
it but it doesn't say it's not there
 
02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:26.790 align:start position:0%
it but it doesn't say it's not there
uh

02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh
so

02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of this
 
02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:32.309 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of this
selectmen

02:57:32.319 --> 02:57:33.349 align:start position:0%

02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
these the ohrvs on the road
 
02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:40.000 align:start position:0%

02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate graves for the
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association we
 
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
we really have two reasons for opposing
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
this bill the first is that
 
02:58:44.230 --> 02:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
it would conflict with existing law
 
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
current new hampshire law prohibits
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities from spending money on
 
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
class 6 roads
 
02:58:51.269 --> 02:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
you see this in various statutes for
 
02:58:51.279 --> 02:58:52.550 align:start position:0%
you see this in various statutes for
example

02:58:52.550 --> 02:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 229 colon 5 which is the definition
 
02:58:55.840 --> 02:58:56.710 align:start position:0%
rsa 229 colon 5 which is the definition
of

02:58:56.710 --> 02:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:58:56.720 --> 02:58:59.590 align:start position:0%
of
highways

02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:03.269 --> 02:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
the major roads that municipalities use
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
class five roads
 
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
are those that they have a duty to
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
maintain and known as town roads whereas
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
class six roads are just simply
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
classified as all other public ways
 
02:59:17.990 --> 02:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
and generally are those that would be
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
not maintained
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
you also have um references to this in
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
rsa 231 colon 50
 
02:59:29.349 --> 02:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
and rsa 231 93
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
those relate more specifically to
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
the core of the point is that there are
 
02:59:39.190 --> 02:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
numerous references throughout the
 
02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
statutes that clearly exempt
 
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities from a duty to maintain
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
class six roads and that prohibit them
 
02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
from spending money on those roads
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that makes it very difficult if not
 
02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
impossible to actually
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
do what this bill says which is that the
 
03:00:00.630 --> 03:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
municipality would have to determine
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
how the road was damaged because it
 
03:00:05.190 --> 03:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
could only be using the funds to repair
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
damage done by ohrvis so for example if
 
03:00:10.389 --> 03:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
a logging truck went down the road and
 
03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
caused damage
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know you have to determine what the
 
03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
difference is betw of that damage
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
between that logging truck which they
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't repair and there wouldn't be a
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
provision repair
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
and an ohrv use which they would under
 
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill be required to repair
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
the other concern that we have is that
 
03:00:32.230 --> 03:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would undermine the ability to
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
recover damages from those who actually
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
damage the road
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
so there are provisions in statute
 
03:00:41.590 --> 03:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh for example rsa 231 colon 11 which
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
requires someone who
 
03:00:45.429 --> 03:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
damages a road to restore it to its
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
prior condition
 
03:00:50.309 --> 03:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
and rsa 236 colon
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
39 which is the civil liability for
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
damages to road statute there's also
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
criminal liability to uh for damages to
 
03:01:00.389 --> 03:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
roads that's generally a purposeful
 
03:01:00.399 --> 03:01:01.349 align:start position:0%
roads that's generally a purposeful
damage

03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
damage
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
um so if someone purposely goes out and
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
digs up the road for example
 
03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
but in any case if someone goes out and
 
03:01:11.910 --> 03:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
damages the road the municipality could
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
accept in
 
03:01:16.550 --> 03:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
this specific instance of the ohrv
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
damaging the road
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
go out and recover that damages so
 
03:01:24.469 --> 03:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
you know if you have for example a group
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
of riders who
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
are going on the road during mud season
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
and it's an unpaved road that's
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
obviously going to cause
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
more damage
 
03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:34.469 align:start position:0%
more damage
than

03:01:34.469 --> 03:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
in other conditions
 
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
ordinarily the municipality you know if
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is significant enough to rise the
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
level of damage
 
03:01:44.630 --> 03:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
that it will be worth pursuing a court
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
case over
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
could go after those specific
 
03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:48.710 align:start position:0%
could go after those specific
individuals

03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
but it would appear under this bill that
 
03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
that would not be a possibility because
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
the municipality would now have the
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to repair the road using
 
03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
their own funds so those are the two
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
major reasons that we object the bill
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly happy to answer any
 
03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:06.710 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly happy to answer any
questions

03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%

you give us that first
 
03:02:15.750 --> 03:02:15.760 align:start position:0%

03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
and uh it's actually roman six is the
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:28.150 --> 03:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr gray
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes mr crichton representative creighton
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you i have two questions
 
03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:37.110 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you i have two questions
um

03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
the first question is under the current
 
03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:40.710 align:start position:0%
the first question is under the current
rsas

03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
the selectmen of the town
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
can authorize ohrv on classics roads
 
03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:48.469 align:start position:0%
can authorize ohrv on classics roads
correct

03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay second question then is
 
03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
if they can authorize that
 
03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:56.389 align:start position:0%
if they can authorize that
usage

03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
usage
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
then what they're authorizing under your
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
under what you've just said is they're
 
03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:02.790 align:start position:0%
under what you've just said is they're
authorizing

03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
authorizing
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
other people from other places
 
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
to create damage on a road and then
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
requiring the citizen adjacent to that
 
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
road to fix that road how does that make
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
any sense
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
well let me let me clarify because i i
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't quite agree with your
 
03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
wouldn't quite agree with your
characterization

03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
characterization
 
03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so any
 
03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
town road so any class four or five or
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
six road
 
03:03:25.279 --> 03:03:26.469 align:start position:0%
six road
is

03:03:26.469 --> 03:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
the way to think about it really is it's
 
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
owned by the town so if someone causes
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
damage to that road
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to repair that road you have
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
to get the town's permission to do that
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's no authorization under the
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
statutes for the town to spend money on
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
class six roads per in particular but if
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
someone who lives on a class six road
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
wants to repair that they have to go to
 
03:03:47.429 --> 03:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
the town to get permission that's
 
03:03:49.750 --> 03:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
different than say a private road where
 
03:03:52.230 --> 03:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
the people living on it can go repair it
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
now it's possible that that road might
 
03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
be classified as an emergency lane and
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency lane provision
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
so you you can see that uh often where
 
03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
a large number of houses along a
 
03:04:05.670 --> 03:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
classics road and that would actually
 
03:04:07.269 --> 03:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
authorize the municipality to spend
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
money on that road regardless of what
 
03:04:11.030 --> 03:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
what its classification is or whether
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's a private road to maintain it
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
suitable for passage
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
um for emergency vehicles so they could
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually there are ways to maintain it
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
and there are local options to do that
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
as as far as
 
03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh the authorization for ohrvs go
 
03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:31.110 align:start position:0%
uh the authorization for ohrvs go
um

03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
the way i would look at it is the the
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
same way that the law would look at any
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
sort of damage you know
 
03:04:38.309 --> 03:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
let's say a logging truck go along a
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
road you know over time a number of
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
trucks there you know just the ordinary
 
03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
wear and tear is going to do damage
 
03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
depending on how the structure of the
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
road is
 
03:04:51.269 --> 03:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
that may or may not cause more damage
 
03:04:53.190 --> 03:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
which is the reason we have a statutory
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
provision for weight limits so for
 
03:04:59.269 --> 03:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
example in mud season the uh the
 
03:04:59.279 --> 03:05:01.269 align:start position:0%
example in mud season the uh the
underlying

03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
foundation of the road may not be quite
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
as stable so you have a weight limit and
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you surpass that weight limit and
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
cause damage to the road
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
there are fines and and potentially you
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
know suits attached to that you don't
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
see that happen very often because
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's not something that you know an
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
individual truck is gonna gonna cause a
 
03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
lot of damage but it might be something
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh with a business with a large number
 
03:05:26.469 --> 03:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
of trucks going through or a timber cut
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
or something like that is more often
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
where you see some sort of penalty
 
03:05:29.279 --> 03:05:30.469 align:start position:0%
where you see some sort of penalty
imposed

03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
imposed
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
um so as far as kind of the
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
authorization goes
 
03:05:35.279 --> 03:05:37.510 align:start position:0%
authorization goes
um

03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:40.070 --> 03:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing especially special about
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
ohrvs uh you know they don't necessarily
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
dig up the road um
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
i mean it depends really on what the
 
03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
conditions are and how they're riding
 
03:05:52.230 --> 03:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
those vehicles but if you're just
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
traveling along the road um it's
 
03:05:57.750 --> 03:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
possible that you know they won't cause
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
any additional damage as compared to
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
other traffic it's just that you have a
 
03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
higher number of vehicles along the road
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be very specific
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
but you know if somebody's going in you
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
know doing figure eights and the
 
03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
ditching or something like that that's
 
03:06:14.469 --> 03:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
going to undermine the road and cause
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
more damage and that's more often the
 
03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
case where you're going to see
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
the municipality put in effort to
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
actually try to stop that behavior
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
because it's going to
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
cause that unnecessary damage but again
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a case-by-case basis
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions from mr graves
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
03:06:43.269 --> 03:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
testifying mr grayson thanks for taking
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
my testimony um you did you did speak a
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
while back about um you know the roads
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
posted in the spring with weight limits
 
03:06:56.309 --> 03:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
are class six roads posted in the spring
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
because of the weight limits that's a
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
individual municipality decision um so
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
often what you'll see is a
 
03:07:08.230 --> 03:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
road agent for the municipality will go
 
03:07:11.429 --> 03:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
out assess each road in the town and
 
03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're just roads that are
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
always have a weight limit for the
 
03:07:16.550 --> 03:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
spring but it's something that's made on
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
an a decision that's made on an annual
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes um
 
03:07:24.880 --> 03:07:25.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes um
you

03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:07:27.030 --> 03:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure i heard this
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
correctly but
 
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
you did say that class four five and six
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
roads are owned by the town
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way i think about them um in
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
the sense that the town has all the
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
rights to
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
the road itself they may not necessarily
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
own the land underneath the road so it's
 
03:07:48.870 --> 03:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
technically a road is technically a
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
viatic easement so an easement that
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
allows the public to travel over and do
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
other things
 
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
that relate to traveling along that road
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and there's a
 
03:08:01.590 --> 03:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
a large number of case law from the
 
03:08:04.389 --> 03:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
1800s about that um and feeding horses
 
03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
and all of that but um
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
really the way to think about it is that
 
03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
the town owns the road in the sense that
 
03:08:13.830 --> 03:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's the select board
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
under their authority to manage the
 
03:08:15.359 --> 03:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
under their authority to manage the
roads

03:08:16.550 --> 03:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
roads
 
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
have the authority to determine what
 
03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
happens to those roads whether it's you
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
know allowing ohrvs to use it or whether
 
03:08:24.309 --> 03:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know you have a horse and
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
buggies going along it whatever the case
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
um it's the the select board that's
 
03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to make that decision under our
 
03:08:36.309 --> 03:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
one more
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:08:38.399 --> 03:08:39.349 align:start position:0%
all right
um

03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
my last question
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
is you did mention there were local
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
options to repairing these class six
 
03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
options to repairing these class six
roads

03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
roads
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
correct i wondered what
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
what those would include because
 
03:08:53.590 --> 03:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard anything from people
 
03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
i've talked to who all live on classics
 
03:08:58.950 --> 03:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
roads right so
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
one of the the really the major option
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
that the municipality would have is
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
declare it as an emergency lane and
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
essentially they would they would need
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
to have a public hearing and it's
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
generally either the fire chief or the
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
police chief that comes
 
03:09:14.550 --> 03:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
and specifies why this needs to be an
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
emergency lane because
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who provide the
 
03:09:20.229 --> 03:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
emergency services so they'll come in
 
03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
and say you know there's 20 houses at
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
the end of this road it's a private road
 
03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
or it's a class six road
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know we can't maintain it but we
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
need to get the fire truck down there in
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
case there's a fire or whatever the case
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
may be or the road leads to the pond and
 
03:09:36.309 --> 03:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
we need to fill up the fire truck um and
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that's something the municipality has
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
the option of doing
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
and that provides them the ability to
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
maintain the road to the standard of
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
being able to be traveled by the
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know you could always have the town
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
reclassify a road as a class five road
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of options to do
 
03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
that and
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'd bore you to tears if i went through
 
03:10:05.910 --> 03:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
those um but you could always do that
 
03:10:08.950 --> 03:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then maintain it um
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
and if you stop maintaining the class
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
five road
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
in a condition suitable for travel for
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
five or more years then then it reverts
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
to a class six road so i mean you have
 
03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
options of different things you could do
 
03:10:22.710 --> 03:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:24.309 align:start position:0%
at the local level
um

03:10:24.309 --> 03:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
to to require municipal maintenance
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
um which would not require any sort of
 
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
investigation of of who caused the
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
damage um if that's an option that you
 
03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
want to pursue
 
03:10:37.349 --> 03:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
any other yes
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions i just want
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
to get some clarity so i may have a
 
03:10:45.990 --> 03:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
question and follow up
 
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
so you said that the
 
03:10:49.510 --> 03:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
slick board
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
can periodically review the weight
 
03:10:52.239 --> 03:10:53.670 align:start position:0%
can periodically review the weight
limits

03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
limits
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
to adjust the weight limits for the
 
03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
damage that might come from trucking on
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
roads correct
 
03:10:59.840 --> 03:11:00.790 align:start position:0%
roads correct
so

03:11:00.790 --> 03:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
would they also be able to then
 
03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:04.309 align:start position:0%
would they also be able to then
review

03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
the damage there since that so because
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing that their the town is
 
03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
then responsible or controlling their
 
03:11:12.389 --> 03:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the damage that might
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
come to the roads
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
if a select board is now a current
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
statute allowed to allow ohrvs to travel
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
on the road wouldn't they be needing to
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
take the same responsibility
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain those roads from ho or hrv
 
03:11:26.399 --> 03:11:28.309 align:start position:0%
to maintain those roads from ho or hrv
travel

03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
travel
 
03:11:28.319 --> 03:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
travel
i

03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so because
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
with a weight limit you're looking at
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
something like um
 
03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you take the road in front
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the state house here which they
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
recently repaired
 
03:11:43.590 --> 03:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
before it was repaired it may be the
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
case that you know it was the end of its
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
life uh usable life and therefore it was
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
necessary for the concord city council
 
03:11:54.469 --> 03:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
to put a weight limit on it um and that
 
03:11:55.990 --> 03:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
would have
 
03:11:58.389 --> 03:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
effectively either prevented large
 
03:12:00.150 --> 03:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
trucks from going down it
 
03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
trucks from going down it
or

03:12:01.110 --> 03:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
they would have paid the penalty for
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
doing so assuming it was enforced all
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
and that's going to change based on the
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
conditions of the road
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
once it's been repaved you don't
 
03:12:13.269 --> 03:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to do that and it's not
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
required that you review every road for
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
a weight limit
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a it's an option and you're
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
going to attach those to things
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
where that type of activity is going to
 
03:12:24.239 --> 03:12:25.269 align:start position:0%
where that type of activity is going to
cause

03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
cause
 
03:12:25.279 --> 03:12:27.349 align:start position:0%
cause
damage

03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
damage
 
03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
no follow-up
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative perez
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me ask the
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
question my question to you is um
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
if we have in a situation where
 
03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
you see people coming from other streets
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
driving their
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
hrvs in the area that
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
only vehicles supposed to be
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
how are we gonna handle the situation if
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
the role get damaged by the hrbs because
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
the people who damage and death the role
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not from not living on the street
 
03:13:16.229 --> 03:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
that this is you know happening
 
03:13:18.229 --> 03:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
how did that situation get handled
 
03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
if i understand your your question
 
03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:22.229 align:start position:0%
if i understand your your question
correctly

03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
i mean the way i would analogize it is
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know when they built the road they
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
would have they would have had certain
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and if you look at
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
something like the dots geometric design
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
standards they would say you know you
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
look at the road and you figure out how
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
many average you know
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
average times a car or other vehicle is
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to go over the road and that's
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to that's going to give you the
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
result of how you want to build the road
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
and if you suddenly convert something
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
like a residential road to
 
03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
a cut-through
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
as has frequently happened with
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
something like google maps
 
03:13:58.229 --> 03:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot more traffic
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
over the road than you would otherwise
 
03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good solution for you
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
because you certainly see that in many
 
03:14:07.439 --> 03:14:08.830 align:start position:0%
because you certainly see that in many
different

03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances but i i think
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's really something that
 
03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
they have to determine at the local
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
level determine what is the appropriate
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
nature maybe the case that they want to
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
convert that to a class 5 road and
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
therefore have the municipality take
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
over responsibility for it
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the cleanest way under the
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.150 --> 03:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
sir another question to my right any
 
03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative post
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr vice chair and thank you
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
again for today for coming to testify um
 
03:14:44.710 --> 03:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
my question is very simple i wanted to
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
know you had talked about someone who
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
purposely digs up a roadway
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
do you have that
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
rsa i i don't have off the top of my
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
head the uh the criminal damage to
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
rhodes but i can certainly look that up
 
03:15:00.229 --> 03:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
and give that to you by the end of the
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr grace for your
 
03:15:17.429 --> 03:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%

evander

03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
evander
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
again i i have to emphasize
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you're all looking into
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
this problem that's statewide
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
and also you need to know that right now
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office is
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
actively defending the bureau of trail's
 
03:15:53.830 --> 03:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
right to ignore the laws that govern
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
where ohrv trails are allowed so we've
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
got all these trail sighting
 
03:15:58.239 --> 03:16:00.550 align:start position:0%
got all these trail sighting
requirements

03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:16:00.560 --> 03:16:01.429 align:start position:0%
requirements
and

03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is saying well
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
bureau of trails doesn't have to follow
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
them and they're also saying that the
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
town of gorham doesn't have to follow
 
03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
them our own zoning our noise ordinance
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have to follow them
 
03:16:12.800 --> 03:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
you don't have to follow them
so

03:16:13.990 --> 03:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
when you
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
file these bills to address the ohrv
 
03:16:17.439 --> 03:16:18.389 align:start position:0%
file these bills to address the ohrv
problem

03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
please consider
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
adding in
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
the abolishing of immunity for ohrv
 
03:16:27.830 --> 03:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
trail citing decisions
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
by the municipalities and the state
 
03:16:32.790 --> 03:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that will give the teeth that these
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
desperately needed bills
 
03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:35.590 align:start position:0%
desperately needed bills
need

03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
when they become law
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time and
 
03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:41.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time and
concern

03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:16:46.710 --> 03:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:55.349 --> 03:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
next also on in opposition to the bill
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
chris gamash nhoh
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee for the record again my name
 
03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
is chris gamache my resident of
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
gilmanton new hampshire and i'm on the
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
board of directors of the new hampshire
 
03:17:20.790 --> 03:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
off highway vehicle association
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh and we are here
 
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition of house bill 1128
 
03:17:28.150 --> 03:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief i won't belabor what
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
03:17:33.429 --> 03:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
discussed which was some of our concerns
 
03:17:35.830 --> 03:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
but we believe creating this simple
 
03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:37.030 align:start position:0%
but we believe creating this simple
section

03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
in the ohrv laws would actually conflict
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
with at least four other existing
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
statutes that would also have to be
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
looked at and addressed
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise this bill simply creates more
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
confusion and questions than it
 
03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
confusion and questions than it
clarifies

03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
03:17:49.520 --> 03:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
clarifies
um

03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
this bill also creates the same
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
subsection in law as house bill 1108 it
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
would both be creating a new subsection
 
03:17:58.000 --> 03:17:58.790 align:start position:0%
would both be creating a new subsection
b

03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
b
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
under roman numeral nine
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
so if both bills were to move forward
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
they would actually be in conflict with
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
each other and that would have to be
 
03:18:05.359 --> 03:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
each other and that would have to be
clarified

03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
and we believe that the changes sought
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
in this legislation are far more
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
complicated than adding one
 
03:18:12.399 --> 03:18:13.670 align:start position:0%
complicated than adding one
subsection

03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
that require rewrite of many laws we
 
03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
believe potentially unintended
 
03:18:19.349 --> 03:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
consequences of such a revision to our
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
existing laws requires a much more
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
thorough review
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we believe that some of these
 
03:18:26.469 --> 03:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
questions are better suited toward house
 
03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill 1188's proposed study commission
 
03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:30.309 align:start position:0%
bill 1188's proposed study commission
which

03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'll be up shortly to support
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
so we think a lot of these questions
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
should be routed
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
toward that study commission
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
with that i'll end my testimony thank
 
03:18:41.359 --> 03:18:42.469 align:start position:0%
with that i'll end my testimony thank
you

03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%

anyone else that would like to speak on
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%

03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
owners association our members own
 
03:19:49.439 --> 03:19:52.389 align:start position:0%
owners association our members own
timberland

03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.399 --> 03:19:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:19:53.269 --> 03:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
over which class six roads pass
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
and a but
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
and we i come here today in in support
 
03:20:01.830 --> 03:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
of this bill
um

03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i i want to explain to you kind of
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
why why we're engaged in this discussion
 
03:20:11.349 --> 03:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
um timber and timberland
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
the value of timber and timberland is
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
driven much by access you've got a tree
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
growing in the forest its value in many
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
instances predicated by the ability to
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
get that tree to market roads and
 
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in maintaining roads and
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure are important and they
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
they have a direct effect on timber
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
values and timberland values
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
and if that road and infrastructure
 
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
deteriorates and it becomes impassable
 
03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
that affects your value and your ability
 
03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
that affects your value and your ability
to

03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
your values and also your ability to do
 
03:20:44.389 --> 03:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
management on your property
 
03:20:47.190 --> 03:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
um class six roads as you've heard from
 
03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
the municipal association
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're an important part of the
 
03:20:53.190 --> 03:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
state's infrastructure they're municipal
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
roads the towns own the right-of-way the
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
but the towns do have the authority to
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
the authority to manage the right-of-way
 
03:21:08.469 --> 03:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
over top of it they can and they have in
 
03:21:11.110 --> 03:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
their toolbox within the road statute a
 
03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
bunch of tools to do that
 
03:21:15.910 --> 03:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
they can post a road for weight limits
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
as you've heard
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
they can also require bonds
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you're going to use a road
 
03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
and this is frequent in the timber
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
business if i'm go i file my intent to
 
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
cut and i'm going to travel across the
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
road the road agent will say okay mr
 
03:21:33.750 --> 03:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
stock you're going to be driving some
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
large trucks on our road we would like
 
03:21:38.229 --> 03:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
you to post a bond in the event that one
 
03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
of your trucks harms the road
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
we have a financial financial surety
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
here to repair that road so that you
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't just skip town
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
and now we're stuck with a road that's
 
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
that has has
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
problems um
 
03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
so there there are a number of of tools
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
that and abilities to do that class six
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
roads are subject to gates and bars
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
although they don't typically put locks
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
on them they do have gates and they they
 
03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
can be subject to gates and bars as well
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
this is a subject that i have to and it
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
usually happens right around march 1st
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
my phone starts ringing as road postings
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
go up and i have loggers trying to move
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
wood out of the woods
 
03:22:22.150 --> 03:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh to the mill um and they're talking
 
03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
and working with road agents my phone
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
starts to ring
 
03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
and you know we try to find amicable
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
solutions and ways to work through this
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
so that people can get their wood to the
 
03:22:34.710 --> 03:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
market um
 
03:22:36.630 --> 03:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the reason
 
03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'll say more recent wrinkles that we're
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
seeing is with roads and class six roads
 
03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
in particular in recreational use
 
03:22:48.150 --> 03:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
so if i'm if i have a road
 
03:22:50.070 --> 03:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
a class six road that's accessing my
 
03:22:50.080 --> 03:22:51.190 align:start position:0%
a class six road that's accessing my
property

03:22:51.190 --> 03:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
many times these roads are are very
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
almost impassable to a standard vehicle
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
if i as a landowner or a land manager
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
logger or forester want to go in and do
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
a timber sale and do some management on
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
that land i'm obligated i can't legally
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
touch that right of way until i get
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
authority from the selectmen so i'll go
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
to the selectmen and say selectmen this
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to do can i have
 
03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
authority to do this
 
03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
authority to do this
and

03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
most times most often they'll say
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely go ahead and do it it's my
 
03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
money that i invest in that road if i
 
03:23:29.990 --> 03:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to bring gravel in if i have to
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
bring phil if i have to put an excavator
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
out there to smooth things out or a
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
dozer it's my money that i as a private
 
03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
citizen so the town is not making that
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
investment it's me as a landowner and of
 
03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
course that gets built into my timber
 
03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:44.710 align:start position:0%
course that gets built into my timber
sale

03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
sale
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
in my management work
 
03:23:50.309 --> 03:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's also not uncommon to have the town
 
03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
say okay thank you for that oh by the
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
way we'd like you to also bond that i've
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
gotten calls from loggers saying how
 
03:24:00.790 --> 03:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
does this work i just sent spent thirty
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and now they want me to
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
bond it
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
my biggest incentive here not to damage
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
it is the fact that i just dropped
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars but we pay the
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
bond because it's it is a legal right
 
03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
that the towns have and
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
we we go about our business
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
what gets frustrating is
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
i go to i have to go to the selectmen i
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
have to get approval
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
i put my money into the road i actually
 
03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
then in some instances have to ensure
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that with a bond
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
there are instances where perhaps a road
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
posting gets a posting gets posted so i
 
03:24:37.110 --> 03:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
can't use it during mud season
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
yet that road continues to see
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
other traffic
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i've had more than and i could have
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
paraded in landowners and foresters
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
today to give you many stories of where
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
i've gone through this process to watch
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
my investment literally get washed down
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
the road
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
because of use during particularly
 
03:25:00.630 --> 03:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
sensitive times of the year
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
mud season where the road is sensitive
 
03:25:05.190 --> 03:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to stay off it
 
03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:06.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to stay off it
but

03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
an individual decides it might be pretty
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
cool to see if they can make it up that
 
03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
cool to see if they can make it up that
hill

03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
hill
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
and uh as a result create a pair of ruts
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that erode and wash out
 
03:25:18.790 --> 03:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
so our interest in this bill
 
03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
is is one that we look at and we say all
 
03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
is is one that we look at and we say all
right

03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:25:23.760 --> 03:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
you know
we're

03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
we have a set of rules and guidelines by
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
which we operate on
 
03:25:32.070 --> 03:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
we've we've worked with those for for
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
um but there are other users out there
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
and you know we're making investments in
 
03:25:40.150 --> 03:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
this infrastructure we're doing what we
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
should be there are other users out
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
there that may not have the the inves
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
clearly not the financial investment
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
and for us there seems to be an inequity
 
03:25:49.279 --> 03:25:50.389 align:start position:0%
and for us there seems to be an inequity
there

03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:25:53.429 --> 03:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i will grant you um
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this piece of
 
03:25:54.960 --> 03:25:56.389 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this piece of
legislation

03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and i applaud the sponsors efforts
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
probably the the best place for this to
 
03:26:03.190 --> 03:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
land would have been it within the road
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
statutes as you heard from the municipal
 
03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:07.110 align:start position:0%
statutes as you heard from the municipal
association

03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:26:08.790 --> 03:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
because there's a whole body of law that
 
03:26:11.349 --> 03:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
deals with roads road classifications
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
when they switch etc
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i also appreciate the fact that as a
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
municipality they're not going to want
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
to make the investment in the road
 
03:26:22.319 --> 03:26:23.190 align:start position:0%
to make the investment in the road
um

03:26:23.190 --> 03:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
they're not going to want to make the
 
03:26:26.550 --> 03:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
investment because as was discussed
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
earlier it does it will revert to a
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
class 5 road and as a result the town
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
then is hung with that obligation to
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
maintain it
 
03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:36.469 align:start position:0%
maintain it
um

03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:36.479 --> 03:26:38.229 align:start position:0%
um
henceforth

03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
henceforth
 
03:26:38.239 --> 03:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
henceforth
um

03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:40.229 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:26:40.229 --> 03:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:26:42.389 --> 03:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as we wanted to come today and
 
03:26:44.870 --> 03:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of ex lay out this issue we do
 
03:26:48.389 --> 03:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
think there may be some opportunities in
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do this it may be in
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
the context of the study commission it
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
may be in the context of this bill
 
03:26:54.960 --> 03:26:55.750 align:start position:0%
may be in the context of this bill
where

03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps you have a road if you have a
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
local club that wants to use a class six
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
road as a trail say all right
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
adopt a trail you folks have adopted it
 
03:27:07.830 --> 03:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's on you
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
you can you can post a bond
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
you can maintain it
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
and that way the town's not on the hook
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
but yet you have some stewards there
 
03:27:18.790 --> 03:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
that have a have a vested interest in
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that trail and even perhaps a financial
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
interest if a bond is required and say
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right just like you do with your
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
other trails
 
03:27:29.190 --> 03:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
in other networks perhaps that's a
 
03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:30.229 align:start position:0%
in other networks perhaps that's a
solution

03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i would i would offer that as a
 
03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
and i would i would offer that as a
suggestion

03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
03:27:34.800 --> 03:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
suggestion
because

03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
again what we're seeing now
 
03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know the frustration out there
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
amongst landowners and land managers can
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
get pretty great when they've
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
made these investments they have
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
followed the rules they're doing what
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
they should
 
03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:50.710 align:start position:0%
they should
and

03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
then to have it kind of literally wash
 
03:27:52.720 --> 03:27:54.150 align:start position:0%
then to have it kind of literally wash
away

03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
away
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
again we support the bill i will admit
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
it it probably needs some work
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
either where it sits statutorily
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
but and
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
some other minds may need to come to
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
bear and kind of think this through so
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
that towns aren't automatically getting
 
03:28:12.150 --> 03:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
on the hook of having to maintain roads
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
by inadvertently
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
having them classified as a class five
 
03:28:17.830 --> 03:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
road but
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
um i offer that as my testimony today
 
03:28:22.150 --> 03:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and certainly happy
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
to work with you folks
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the future on this issue as
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
it is uh it is a significant issue for
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
for our membership thank you
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
stock for taking my question
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you thought that
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
some work could be done on this and it
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
could possibly be ready for prime time
 
03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
um do you see that that could be done in
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
one or two work sessions or is it going
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
to require more than that
 
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
i given the complexity of roads
 
03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
and there are literally books
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
books written on roads in road law
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
one to two set one to two work sessions
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
might be a bit optimistic
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
i i wish we could
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
but it there is uh this gets it is a can
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
of worms but it is it is an important
 
03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:21.910 align:start position:0%
of worms but it is it is an important
issue

03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:26.950 --> 03:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:29:28.790 --> 03:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
i i have one question you mentioned
 
03:29:28.800 --> 03:29:31.110 align:start position:0%
i i have one question you mentioned
about

03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:32.710 align:start position:0%
about
clubs

03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
clubs
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
adopting a road
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
do you know can a board of selectmen
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
approve a class six road for ohrv
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
subject to the condition that a club
 
03:29:43.439 --> 03:29:45.349 align:start position:0%
subject to the condition that a club
adopted

03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
03:29:47.429 --> 03:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative harp that is a that's a
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
great question and i don't know it was a
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
it was a suggestion that was put forth
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
by one of my committee members
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's been a model that's worked really
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
well with the snowmobile industry where
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
you have clubs and club networks
 
03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that maintain trails police trails and
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
maintain positive landowner relations
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
and so one of the thoughts was
 
03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
if that may be if you have a model there
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
that works perhaps this is another model
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we could try to use and adopt it to
 
03:30:18.389 --> 03:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
the ohrv
 
03:30:20.469 --> 03:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
community as well
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
see no other hands thank you very much
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
did we miss anybody else's great pink
 
03:30:31.840 --> 03:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
did we miss anybody else's great pink
card

03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
card
 
03:30:32.960 --> 03:30:33.830 align:start position:0%
card
yes

03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:45.670 --> 03:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
boyd smith i live in concord new
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i thought i'd put a card
 
03:30:51.510 --> 03:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
up there yes you did it was hidden so
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is kind of that administrative
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
thing again i sent the email yesterday
 
03:30:56.830 --> 03:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
opposition um i'd like to change that
 
03:31:01.830 --> 03:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
officially to support
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
um but i've got to say after listening
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
to this expert testimony of a few people
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
in front of me that really know this
 
03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:09.269 align:start position:0%
in front of me that really know this
business

03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:31:12.150 --> 03:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's clearly an awful lot to unpack
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
or actually pack in
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think what i wanted to say i like the
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
idea of my understanding the intention
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill to link
 
03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
of the bill to link
a

03:31:23.030 --> 03:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipal decision with a municipal
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility that simple understanding
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
is if you open it and the town you know
 
03:31:32.229 --> 03:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
it has some
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
to manage that road versus right now we
 
03:31:38.070 --> 03:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
can't put money into classics as my
 
03:31:40.070 --> 03:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
understanding but that being said it's
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
clearly clearly a complicated situation
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm also looking at 1188 you know as
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
a broader opportunity to study what
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
really is a statewide
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
broad-based issue and i won't even say a
 
03:31:55.590 --> 03:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
problem but there's multiple users on
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
multiple you know rail trails and
 
03:31:58.710 --> 03:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
classics roads
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
take a good careful look at that with
 
03:32:03.030 --> 03:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders that need to be at
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the table
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
so we can figure out some of these
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
complexities to maintain our you know
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
our recreational systems our classics
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
public transport systems
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh really makes a ton of sense so i'm uh
 
03:32:19.349 --> 03:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
supporting the attention of the bill
 
03:32:21.910 --> 03:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that this concept probably
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
needs a bigger

have worked with the city of clermont
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
the town of cornish and the town of
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
newport and in the last two years we've
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
put in over fifty thousand dollars worth
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%

this bill and the one i submitted
earlier

03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
as great examples of how things can work
 
03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:31.190 align:start position:0%
as great examples of how things can work
and

03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
there is certainly
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
the ability for a municipality to grant
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
permission to a club to maintain those
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
roads and we have been doing it the
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
right way for many years
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr wilkie um but before you
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
leave can you fill out a pink card so
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk can have it any questions from
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.080 --> 03:34:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:56.389 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%

03:34:56.399 --> 03:34:58.070 align:start position:0%
representative
kelly

03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
kelly
 
03:35:00.550 --> 03:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
mr wilkie um so there was the question
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
earlier about whether
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh if a club puts a trail on their trail
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
map are they responsible is there a
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
legal responsibility to to maintain that
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
trail or maintain that road so when we
 
03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
get a permission slip uh which comes
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
from the bureau of trails
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
we are growing
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain sign and keep in safe
 
03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
to maintain sign and keep in safe
condition

03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
condition
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
these trails and roads
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
often times in municipality the road is
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
already open to ohrvs like in cornish
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
those roads have been open since the
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
their early 70s
 
03:35:35.279 --> 03:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
their early 70s
and

03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
they just then
 
03:35:41.190 --> 03:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
extend permission to our club by written
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know indefinite and then when we
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
need to do work on it we go back they
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
fill out a form for the maintenance and
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
then we can apply for grant aid or we
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
pay for it ourselves
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the trucks the 4x4 trucks
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
that go over these roads
 
03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
because they're legally registered do
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
more damage than our small machines our
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
machines the largest ones are two
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
last year eversource used cat whole road
 
03:36:15.429 --> 03:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
and they totally ruined the road uh and
 
03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
and our club actually had to go in and
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
use our funds to fix it and then we got
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
washed out with the summer rains and we
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
had to go fix it again
 
03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:25.269 align:start position:0%
had to go fix it again
and

03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have the capability because of the
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%

bills related to ohrvs in new hampshire
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
were introduced in 1989.

passing laws which take small bites out
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
of some of the challenges that we have
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
recognized but as you know deadlines for
 
03:40:17.429 --> 03:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
committee work do not allow for a deep

in august of 2021 a group of

03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
came together and brainstormed about
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing concerns related to ohrvs
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i have distributed that article that
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
was in the paper that talked about that
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
meeting to all the
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
counselor kenny suggested a commission
 
03:41:02.950 --> 03:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
which could work long term to try to
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
solve some of the challenges and this
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill came out of that meeting
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.389 --> 03:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you look at page
 
03:41:17.910 --> 03:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
two of the no page one of the bill there
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
is a list no that's members never mind
 
03:41:22.150 --> 03:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
page two
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
talks about some of the duties which the
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
commission will study and current cur
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
including current statutes related to
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
ohrvs which some of them conflict with
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
each other because of all the many many
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
bills that have been passed into law
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%

03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%

03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%

03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
consistency and enforcement
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
education and safety requirements for
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
ohrv riders which we had a bill last
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
week about
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
a positive and adverse effect on the
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
economy of ohrvs and the impacts of
 
03:42:07.030 --> 03:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
requiring rental agents to install speed
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
regulating governors on ohrv's provided
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
to renters
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
and of course the all all other issues
 
03:42:17.349 --> 03:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
which come before the commission
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
so this it's a huge charge it's not
 
03:42:24.150 --> 03:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
an easy fix it's going to take quite a
 
03:42:26.309 --> 03:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
while which is why it is a five-year
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
commission and not a two-year or
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
one-year commission
 
03:42:30.399 --> 03:42:31.510 align:start position:0%
one-year commission
because

03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
to make it any shorter than five years
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
would just not allow the time needed to
 
03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
would just not allow the time needed to
review

03:42:39.030 --> 03:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
i mean the two bills we just heard the
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
safety bill we had uh last week
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
the education bill we had last week all
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
of these are just little bites of the
 
03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
of these are just little bites of the
apple

03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
apple
 
03:42:53.429 --> 03:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
so i have received a lot of input from
 
03:42:57.269 --> 03:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
people um requesting changes to the
 
03:42:59.110 --> 03:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
commission membership
 
03:43:01.269 --> 03:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
and i did pass out a
 
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
possible amendment it hasn't been
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
submitted yet because i expect it may be
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
tweaked a little bit more even and that
 
03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
gives you
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
a number of people on all sides of the
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
issue whether they're ohrv clubs the
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
bureau of trails members of the public
 
03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:21.110 align:start position:0%
bureau of trails members of the public
landowners

03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
conservation commission i mean and the
 
03:43:25.510 --> 03:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
rail trail coalition so i tried to
 
03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:26.630 align:start position:0%
rail trail coalition so i tried to
include

03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of stakeholders so a really good
 
03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
discussion can happen out of this
 
03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
discussion can happen out of this
commission

03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:43:33.750 --> 03:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you will support it and
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
i can try to answer any questions and
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
also to actually add to the safety issue
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
i did pass out um
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
september 21 crash reports from fish and
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
game and almost all of them are due to
 
03:43:48.800 --> 03:43:51.110 align:start position:0%
game and almost all of them are due to
inexperience

03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
inexperience
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
and speeding and not obeying the current
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
laws and
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
then you also have recklessness too but
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
these are all things that kind of turned
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
my head and made me think we really have
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
to do something and the legislator who
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh brought together the stakeholders in
 
03:44:07.760 --> 03:44:09.189 align:start position:0%
uh brought together the stakeholders in
august

03:44:09.189 --> 03:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
august
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
is one of the co-sponsors of this bill
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
and two of the other legislators who
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
were at that meeting are also
 
03:44:18.150 --> 03:44:18.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:44:30.790 --> 03:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned
 
03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative smith this is a five-year
 
03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:33.830 align:start position:0%
representative smith this is a five-year
commission

03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
but on the bill it says that it uh it
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
will be repealed in 2026 so um i think
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
of that as four years well it's november
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
of 2026 so i guess it's four and a half
 
03:44:46.399 --> 03:44:47.830 align:start position:0%
of 2026 so i guess it's four and a half
okay

03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%

03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
owners i've just received information
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
that the way that uh timberland owners
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the farm bureau would like to be
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
combined would be one representative
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
representing landowners
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
chosen by the to timberland owners and
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire farm bureau
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that would just
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the number
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you for your
 
03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:57.349 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you for your
testimony

03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
next witness in favor
 
03:46:15.910 --> 03:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much for looking
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would request i i agree with changing
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
the commission makeup so it's more
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative of of a more diverse
 
03:46:33.189 --> 03:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
makeup of new hampshire citizens
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
and also when you're looking into the
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
impact of requiring speed regulators
 
03:46:39.920 --> 03:46:40.790 align:start position:0%
impact of requiring speed regulators
also

03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
noise regulators for the people who are
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere near these machines
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
the noise is a big problem
 
03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you to consider that and
 
03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you to consider that and
again

03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
abolishing immunity for the town and
 
03:46:53.840 --> 03:46:54.950 align:start position:0%
abolishing immunity for the town and
state

03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for looking into this
 
03:47:01.189 --> 03:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%

we'd like to thank representative smith
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
for introducing this she's been involved
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
in these topics certainly with this
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee for a number of years
 
03:47:42.800 --> 03:47:43.830 align:start position:0%
committee for a number of years
speaking

03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
i attended the hearings on the first atv
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
study commission when i was hired by the
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
bureau of trails in 2001 and i've been
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
attending hearings before the rrd
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
transportation other committees ever
 
03:47:56.319 --> 03:47:58.070 align:start position:0%
transportation other committees ever
since

03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i would agree we've passed
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislation about
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
study committees study commissions that
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
have lasted roughly the summer
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
before the next legislative season maybe
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
two years
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and they have not done what is needed to
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
be done a term approach is needed for
 
03:48:15.990 --> 03:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
these discussions there are a lot of
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
topics as you have heard and seen
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
between legislation proposed last week
 
03:48:22.630 --> 03:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
and this week
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
so the new hampshire off highway vehicle
 
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
association wholeheartedly supports the
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 1188
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
we would like to see any proposed
 
03:48:31.439 --> 03:48:32.469 align:start position:0%
we would like to see any proposed
amendment

03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
and one concern would be how big the
 
03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
list of attendees gets the larger a
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
commission gets the more ineffective it
 
03:48:38.880 --> 03:48:39.990 align:start position:0%
commission gets the more ineffective it
becomes

03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we would have concerns with adding
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
more and more people that
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
would likely make it no longer a
 
03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
balanced and fair commission uh with
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
that i'll end my testimony and thank you
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you mr gamache any
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
questions for mr gamache
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative crichton
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr kamasha
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
since 2001 you've been on several
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
commissions what would have been the
 
03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
results of those commissions
 
03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:08.229 align:start position:0%
results of those commissions
and

03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
have those commissions provided value or
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
are they just
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
taking up oxygen uh thank you for the
 
03:49:16.229 --> 03:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
question representative creighton so
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
some of them have provided value um i
 
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
can't remember the house bill number
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
from 2001
 
03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
it was representative alger
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
from romney
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
who filed that study commission
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
we worked with other you know the
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
basically off iowa vehicle bureaus from
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
the other surrounding states to learn
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
what they had done
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
had all their states come in we looked
 
03:49:38.479 --> 03:49:39.510 align:start position:0%
had all their states come in we looked
at

03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:49:42.150 --> 03:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
a host of draft documents the state at
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
that time had come up with 1998 a draft
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
a list of considerations that the state
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
needed to use when they were building
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
an ohiv trail on state lands it had
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
never been tested
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
it actually was then from that
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
commission put into
 
03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
a bill house bill 1273 during the
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
2002-2003 legislative season
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that actually codified this draft
 
03:50:09.750 --> 03:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
untested criteria in law
 
03:50:11.830 --> 03:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
and we've had issues with it ever since
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
um but it did you know put it out that
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
we had to start looking at public lands
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
the issue at the time had been really
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
only private lands were hosting ohrv
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
trails and private landowners really
 
03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to see a balance if they were
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to be asked to only open their
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
lands their expectation was the state
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
would do so as well to support some of
 
03:50:29.920 --> 03:50:31.269 align:start position:0%
would do so as well to support some of
these

03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:50:33.990 --> 03:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
those early on came out with a lot of
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
work um we've had some regarding the
 
03:50:40.389 --> 03:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
roads um you know the house bill
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
519 i testified to earlier from 2019
 
03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
adding in the public policy or the
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
public notice in verified mail to a
 
03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
butter is on class five and six roads
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
those were good changes that came out as
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
well so we have had some
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
but we really haven't taken a big deep
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
dive look
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
in a number of years okay thank you
 
03:51:03.750 --> 03:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.469 --> 03:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr gamache um could you tell
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
me our uh the jeeps with the huge tires
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
classified as ohrvs
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
and do they go routinely on those trails
 
03:51:23.279 --> 03:51:24.389 align:start position:0%
and do they go routinely on those trails
so

03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
the answer is it depends
 
03:51:26.560 --> 03:51:27.670 align:start position:0%
the answer is it depends
um

03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
they are off highway recreational
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles in new hampshire is an
 
03:51:35.110 --> 03:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
extremely broad definition and it's
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
basically anything used off-road with
 
03:51:38.720 --> 03:51:40.630 align:start position:0%
basically anything used off-road with
tires

03:51:40.630 --> 03:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
tires
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
that is used for enjoyment

not on a paved surface or a road

full-size trucks are allowed not atvs
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
and utvs they are traditionally not

allowed on the other trails that clubs
 
03:52:05.830 --> 03:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
manage in the state
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
class six roads though though if they're
 
03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
registered as a conventional motor
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%

goals that representative smith has put
 
03:53:01.840 --> 03:53:02.790 align:start position:0%
goals that representative smith has put
forward

03:53:02.790 --> 03:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
especially around the issue that we
 
03:53:06.070 --> 03:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
talked about last week of
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
responsible ridership and proper safety
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
and rider education um we do um i have
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
not seen representative smith's
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment but we would respectfully
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
request that
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
nhada or one of its designees be added
 
03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
commission member
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
we are the sellers the servicers the
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
registration agents and the rental
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
agents of ohrvs we really are on the
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
front line of these these serious issues
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
surrounding ohrvi usage
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's also we're in the unique position
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
due to our manufacture dealer
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
relationship to get information data and
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
access on some of the
 
03:53:45.189 --> 03:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh i guess latest and greatest
 
03:53:45.199 --> 03:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
uh i guess latest and greatest
technology

03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency and designs that are going
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
into product and product pipeline as
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
well so i heard the issue of noise
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
emission levels certainly something we
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
would have access to governors we are
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
rental agents but we're also the
 
03:54:02.150 --> 03:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
builders of those units so we have great
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge on governors for say
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
the speed limit governor that's proposed
 
03:54:06.640 --> 03:54:07.429 align:start position:0%
the speed limit governor that's proposed
so

03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
with that being said we think our voice
 
03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial in the commission we
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
would welcome the opportunity to
 
03:54:12.960 --> 03:54:14.550 align:start position:0%
would welcome the opportunity to
participate

03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
and further the goals and the important
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
studies that the commission is doing
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd take any questions if
 
03:54:21.910 --> 03:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
there are any but pretty simple thank
 
03:54:24.150 --> 03:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
you mr bennett any questions for mr
 
03:54:24.160 --> 03:54:29.269 align:start position:0%
you mr bennett any questions for mr
bennett

03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
think somebody
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
no i guess thank you mr bennett i
 
03:54:39.189 --> 03:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
our next witness also speaking in
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
support of the bill matt leahy forest
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
hi sorry about that good afternoon my
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
name is matt leahy i'm the
 
03:55:19.990 --> 03:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
public policy director for the foreign
 
03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:21.269 align:start position:0%
public policy director for the foreign
society

03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
society
 
03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i'll be brief um i am
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
i have written testimony i'm not going
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
to read that but i would just say very
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
briefly we support
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
03:55:33.189 --> 03:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
and obviously this committee
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
has spent quite a bit of time on this
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
issue in the last three or four years
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
and there has i think been some helpful
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
steps as a result of that work but i
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
think it's also clear that there you
 
03:55:48.070 --> 03:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
know there are still issues
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
areas of concern conflict between you
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
know atv users and non-atv users and so
 
03:55:56.710 --> 03:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
you know we just think this study
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
commission um
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
will help really get to that you know
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know to these issues and as chris
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
gamache mentioned you know i think now
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
is the time to really take a deep hard
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
the whole global picture here in new
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire on
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
on atvs and how we can you know
 
03:56:17.189 --> 03:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
try to get to the heart of some of these
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
issues so again we support it and um
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll have to take any
 
03:56:21.279 --> 03:56:22.469 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll have to take any
questions

03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.750 --> 03:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
our next witness also in support of the
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
bill boyd smith representing himself mr
 
03:56:39.359 --> 03:56:51.189 align:start position:0%
bill boyd smith representing himself mr
smith

03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again for uh giving me some
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
time to speak this is not an
 
03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
administrative change like the first
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
couple uh
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
it sent out an email uh late yesterday
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
in support of hb1188 and i
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
said with amendments i don't even know
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
if that's allowed but what i'd like to
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
do because i wasn't able to pass out
 
03:57:10.479 --> 03:57:11.830 align:start position:0%
do because i wasn't able to pass out
testimony

03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:57:14.070 --> 03:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
is uh is i would like to read what i
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
said it'll take three minutes
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i apologize but i think that's
 
03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
probably the best use of the time i want
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
to thank representative smith for
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
bringing this up
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's clearly an important issue that is
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to take a bunch of people around
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
the table and some time to get it right
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
as currently written hb 1188 i think is
 
03:57:34.630 --> 03:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
overly focused on ohrvs and the northern
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
03:57:38.550 --> 03:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
given the many hundreds of miles of
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
classics roads and also state-owned
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
abandoned rail corridors throughout new
 
03:57:44.150 --> 03:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire and their hundreds of
 
03:57:46.389 --> 03:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
thousands and hundreds of thousands of
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
non-motorized recreational users
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
the commission's scope should be
 
03:57:50.800 --> 03:57:52.630 align:start position:0%
the commission's scope should be
expanded

03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
in addition there's an opportunity to
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
include pending results of the
 
03:58:00.070 --> 03:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
nhdot rail trail strategic plan i
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
believe they call it due out this summer
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
as well as best management practices
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
being developed under hb 311 which i'm
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
actually assisting with in a in a
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
different capacity
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
so in short hb 1188 provides an
 
03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contribute to the
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
effective long-term planning required to
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
balance multiple competing needs and
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
uses of state public rights of way for
 
03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
the benefit of our state
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
so some of my uh i'll call them
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
recommended amendments or things that
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
ask that this committee to consider
 
03:58:31.199 --> 03:58:35.349 align:start position:0%
ask that this committee to consider
is

03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
avoiding on the list of members for the
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
commission avoiding duplication of
 
03:58:39.279 --> 03:58:40.710 align:start position:0%
commission avoiding duplication of
authority

03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
so for example reaching out to a
 
03:58:44.150 --> 03:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
statewide sheriff a state police
 
03:58:44.160 --> 03:58:45.590 align:start position:0%
statewide sheriff a state police
representative

03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
for that level of law enforcement
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that there's a members of the public
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
section that focuses really on the north
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
country and i understand that's where a
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
lot of this activity is occurring but i
 
03:58:57.030 --> 03:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
suggest it's going to be statewide it's
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
heading that way and why shouldn't it
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
so members of the public should
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
represent the entire state not solely
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
the north country
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
that representatives for non-motorized
 
03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
use should be included as members of the
 
03:59:09.920 --> 03:59:12.229 align:start position:0%
use should be included as members of the
commission

03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:59:14.070 --> 03:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
and my suggestion is that the new
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire rail trails coalition or the
 
03:59:18.150 --> 03:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bike walk alliance would
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
be good associations because they
 
03:59:19.920 --> 03:59:20.950 align:start position:0%
be good associations because they
represent

03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
non-motorized use on a lot of these
 
03:59:22.880 --> 03:59:25.750 align:start position:0%
non-motorized use on a lot of these
trails

03:59:25.750 --> 03:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
i also think that uh representing
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
the wintertime use snowmobiles
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
should be included as members of the
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
commission the snowmobile association i
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
realize it's seasonal but a lot of use
 
03:59:40.150 --> 03:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
on the same networks
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
or at least maybe brought in to testify
 
03:59:43.990 --> 03:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
because they are experienced
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
with maintaining trails and and managing
 
03:59:46.479 --> 03:59:48.710 align:start position:0%
with maintaining trails and and managing
them

03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
section three under duties i've got page
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
two lines eleven through twelve should
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
be expanded to include positive and
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on public rights of way
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
such as rail trails so adding rail
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
trades beyond the class six
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and uh also the overall compatibility of
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
our ohrvs with other uses
 
04:00:11.189 --> 04:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
ohrv and other trail use the
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
non-motorized side of things
 
04:00:15.510 --> 04:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement by state
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
agencies charged with public trail
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
management and stewardship such as d.o.t
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
bureau of trails parks and rec
 
04:00:25.349 --> 04:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
department of cultural natural resources
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
should also be assessed
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
my final recommendation a request is
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the quorum which is currently
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
listed at six
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
we made a simple majority
 
04:00:36.720 --> 04:00:38.309 align:start position:0%
we made a simple majority
and

04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
the reasoning being that this is a large
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and if we have 18 or
 
04:00:45.189 --> 04:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
19 people on the commission
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
and only six can make a decision i think
 
04:00:47.359 --> 04:00:48.150 align:start position:0%
and only six can make a decision i think
that

04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:50.150 --> 04:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
contravenes the effectiveness of the
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
more diverse group
 
04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
so i apologize for my lack of time to
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
speak with the bill sponsors in advance
 
04:00:58.389 --> 04:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
to learn more about how this could work
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
and adjust my testimony accordingly i
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
recommend that hb 1188 be designed as a
 
04:01:07.510 --> 04:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive statewide examination of
 
04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
how public roads and rights of way can
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
be shared by the various user
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
communities so thank you for your
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%

commission and the language that the
 
04:01:58.950 --> 04:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill's sponsor uh representative smith
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
nominating a landowner to to represent
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
someone who owns working land
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with other boards and
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
commissions where we will jointly
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
nominate a landowner particularly
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
someone with working land that has a in
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
this case a trail across it so we

members have seen a tremendous uptick
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
since covid hit
 
04:02:43.349 --> 04:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
talking to land managers and these are
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
land managers across the state
 
04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
they are spending a lot more time
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
managing recreation these days than they
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
ever have and it's everything from
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%

04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate representative creighton's
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
question about is this just another
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
study commission but what i would add is
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
to that is that now more than ever with
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
this increase in recreation
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
it is it has become very uh
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
very acute in
 
04:03:25.840 --> 04:03:27.030 align:start position:0%
very acute in
acute

04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
acute
 
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
costly for landowners and time consuming
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
particularly those landowners who have
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
large tracts of land where
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of recreation going on
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
they say the days of just managing
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
loggers and log trucks
 
04:03:42.870 --> 04:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
those were the good old days now they're
 
04:03:42.880 --> 04:03:44.150 align:start position:0%
those were the good old days now they're
managing

04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
managing
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
all kinds of use so

atvs
 
04:04:56.309 --> 04:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
what does this mean except that those
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
who want to use atvs have more money and
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
more support from legislators
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
than those who do not want atvs used
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
against them

duty of legislators
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
this make evidence-based and ethical
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
assessments and decisions not decisions
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
or recommendations based on power
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and the committee it seeks to
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
establish should not assume the
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
permitting of recreational atv use
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%

04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
recreational atv use is a completely
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
non-essential use of fossil fuels in the
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
midst of our climate emergency
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
most people in this room believe that we
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
are the most important species
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
and we have the right to damage other
 
04:06:01.990 --> 04:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
beings and the law allows it
 
04:06:03.670 --> 04:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
most people believe humans have the
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
right to log bulldoze mine
 
04:06:10.150 --> 04:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
synthesize create buy and consume
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
whatever we want no matter the
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
consequences to our environment and
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
other beings
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
this belief system is not supported by
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
any evidence
 
04:06:23.189 --> 04:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
what supports it is our desperate need
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
to believe in our self-importance
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
we are not only no more important than
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
any other people we are no more
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
important than any other species
 
04:06:36.150 --> 04:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
and because we are the most invasive and
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
damaging species on the planet we have
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
an obligation to radically reduce our
 
04:06:41.040 --> 04:06:42.309 align:start position:0%
an obligation to radically reduce our
consumption

04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
of everything
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
the rational and fair approach to this
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
is to first cease all non-essential
 
04:06:50.479 --> 04:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
is to first cease all non-essential
consumption

04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
atv use like other every other
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
recreational fossil fuel use is
 
04:06:57.279 --> 04:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
recreational fossil fuel use is
non-essential

04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
non-essential
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
so we have no ethical right to engage in
 
04:07:01.600 --> 04:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
so we have no ethical right to engage in
it

04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:07.269 --> 04:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
the atv riders and the legislators that
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
support them honestly looked at the
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
damage you allow or do to others
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
if you looked at the non-consensual
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
nature of your acts
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you inhaled dust others have no
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
choice but to take into their lungs
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
you felt the violation of the noise you
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
ran repeatedly into non-consenting ear
 
04:07:26.479 --> 04:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
ran repeatedly into non-consenting ear
canals

04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
canals
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
you felt the compression of your
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
battering of soil that damages it for
 
04:07:31.840 --> 04:07:33.269 align:start position:0%
battering of soil that damages it for
years

04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
you understood the dead zone that the
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
ride the wilds roads are
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
the fragmentation of terrain the trail's
 
04:07:40.880 --> 04:07:42.149 align:start position:0%
the fragmentation of terrain the trail's
cause

04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
cause
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
the pollution and co2 produced by atvs
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
the abuse of wildlife and trail of
 
04:07:48.000 --> 04:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
the abuse of wildlife and trail of
butters

04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
butters
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
you would then have no choice but to
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
engage in the self-denial
 
04:07:55.110 --> 04:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
of not riding
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the good of the whole
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
those who are exploited and abused by
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
the permitting of atv use
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife the soils watersheds air
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
climate hikers people in atv towns and a
 
04:08:09.600 --> 04:08:11.030 align:start position:0%
climate hikers people in atv towns and a
butters

04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
butters
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
are not just deprived of the right to
 
04:08:13.199 --> 04:08:14.149 align:start position:0%
are not just deprived of the right to
peace

04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
peace
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
quiet privacy and clean air
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
they are pushed down into a position
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
where if they or someone on their behalf
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
asserted their right not to be abused
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
but butters for example blocked an atv
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
trail they would then be
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
arrested so the atvs are not ma'am can i
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
interrupt you for one moment
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
i've let you go on and i appreciate your
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
testimony but can you relate it to the
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill to set up a commission i'm trying
 
04:08:43.199 --> 04:08:43.910 align:start position:0%
bill to set up a commission i'm trying
to

04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
put the two together i got one more
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph and then i'll relate it
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
so the atvs are not only doing damage
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
wherever they are but they contain the
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
implicit threat that those who directly
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to defend themselves or the
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
terrain from being damaged will be
 
04:09:00.239 --> 04:09:01.590 align:start position:0%
terrain from being damaged will be
punished

04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
punished
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislation permitting atvs is
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that permits damages to
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
others and permits the punishment of
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
those who resist this damage
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
situations unacceptable and this
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
committee needs to abandon its
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
assumption that humans are central in
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
this world and have any rights to damage
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
any others for their own pleasure
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the connection with the committee is
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
that there's a presumption that atvs
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
have a right
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be out there in the first place and i
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody questioning
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
their right to be out there
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's the connection does that make
 
04:09:37.040 --> 04:09:38.469 align:start position:0%
that's the connection does that make
sense

04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions of the witness
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
if she'll take questions
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions thank you very
 
04:09:48.319 --> 04:09:49.830 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions thank you very
much

04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that wants to speak
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1188
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'll ask one more time anybody else to
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
speak on house bill
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
1188 if not i'll ask do we have anybody
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
jace weston
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
chris pistoria and abby evano
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%

that was our last bill for this
 
04:10:38.319 --> 04:10:39.670 align:start position:0%
that was our last bill for this
afternoon

04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
i believe we'll meet again next
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
wednesday i think the schedule's already
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
gone out
 
04:11:19.110 --> 04:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.120 --> 04:11:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.680 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
you
