00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
there was some concerns
 
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.589 align:start position:0%
there was some concerns
um

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
that if this was to pass it might be too
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
big a burden on the commission so we
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
just want to go through we did receive a
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
fact sheet there's some data on the case
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
percentage so like to go through that
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
and just understand how big a burden
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
would that be is it real is it perceived
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
and are there any things that we need to
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh to plug also wanted to talk a little
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
bit about um the 180 day wait time uh
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
just to kind of
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
get everybody's thoughts on that and
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
then lastly we did receive a process map
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
which basically goes through how the
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
operation at the commission might be
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
streamlined so just want to kind of play
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
that out how does that contrast with the
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
current operations uh what and what's
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's kind of thoughts on that
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
then we'll go into some open discussion
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll take it from there so is
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with that
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay so first um
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
want to kind of go through the first
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
thing that we talked about in uh our
 
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting uh back in june
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
was the fact that there may be a lot of
 
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.190 align:start position:0%
was the fact that there may be a lot of
issues

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
at the human rights commission that are
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
below the surface and so representative
 
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
below the surface and so representative
dilorenzo

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
dilorenzo
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
asked would it be possible to have a
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
performance audit done
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
and as we talked a little bit in june we
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
thought that there might be some merits
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
to that i did have a zoom meeting over
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
the summer with the state director of
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
audits director smith
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
where he did mention
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
that that might be
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
worthwhile they had done a financial
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
audit in the past
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't really go over into
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
the performance side because that would
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
have taken them out of the scope of the
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
financial audit
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i guess the agency that
 
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.269 align:start position:0%
so i guess the agency that
directs

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
directs
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
which state audits are undertaken uh is
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
the lpoc apparently they're at the call
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
of the chair so they're going to be
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
meeting again
 
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.230 align:start position:0%
meeting again
in

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
october i dashed a
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
note off to senator regan uh with
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
respect to getting us put on the agenda
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
i haven't had any response back from him
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but i will be following up tomorrow
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
on veto day with representative
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
umbricker who's also on that committee
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
just to you know
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
understand what do we need to do to make
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we're on the agenda and
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
when as activity goes forward with that
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'll definitely keep the rest of the
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee up to speed on that
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
the other thing i did have a meeting at
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission itself uh
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the staff at the invitation of
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
director malachi
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
and you know that was a that was a very
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
productive meeting
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
i got to understand you know a lot of
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
the challenges that they are facing
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
there they have done certain things um
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
at the um commission to try to
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
accelerate the time that it takes
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
to move through the process
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
they they've cut the caseload from 50
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
down to 20 to 25. uh also i believe
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're staffed now with uh five
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
investigators where they had been
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
staffed at two they so they're pretty
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
much staffed at the full complement
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're looking um at adding more
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
resources there with respect to that so
 
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.389 align:start position:0%
resources there with respect to that so
um

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
and so it
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting to see um how
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
kind of restructuring because in the
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
past the case load being 50
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
they would just
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
let things go and sometimes things could
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of drag having just 20 cases in
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
folks hands but i don't really know if
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
we have a good feel at this point for
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
what that's really going to do to the
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
the speed at getting things through to a
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause hearing
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
i did meet following that
 
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.829 align:start position:0%
i did meet following that
with

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire associate of justice and
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
different lawyers groups with respect to
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
some of their observations and findings
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
and subsequent to that
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
we did have um
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of emails sent out from marisa
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
chase with the association for justice
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
including uh
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
a fact sheet on uh sb 292 which
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
basically is looking at the removal rate
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
and they provided some data around that
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
and also they provided a roadmap which
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
they feel would allow people to get
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
through to the probable cause finding uh
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
in one year uh and the current statute
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
is two and of course you know we're not
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
we're not at that two year point at this
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
time so as as we get through i'd like to
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
in in the later part of the agenda just
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
kind of go through
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.269 align:start position:0%
uh that
uh

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
that roadmap and and talk about um
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it uh where it's strong
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
where it's weak and if there were
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
strengths to it how would those uh
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
strengths be implemented what was the
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which that could happen
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh where we were
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh the activity from the
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
summer i think though one of the things
 
00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
summer i think though one of the things
that

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
having spoken to the people that i've
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
spoken to
 
00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:48.389 align:start position:0%
spoken to
um

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
um
really

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
really
just

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the scope of where this
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee should go i think really it
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
just at this point needs to stay into
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
296 so there might be other issues that
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have at the human rights commission i
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
really think um that's kind of beyond
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
the ability of this committee to get
 
00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:09.829 align:start position:0%
the ability of this committee to get
into

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
so i think really the scope on this is
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
just 296. what do we need to do to make
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
it work
 
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.870 align:start position:0%
it work
and

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
then let the performance audit come
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
through and do the rest
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
so kind of with with those with that
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
kind of summary recap and statement of
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
purpose i'd open up for members of the
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee does anybody have any thoughts
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
agreements disagreements
 
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
agreements disagreements
um

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative lorenzo
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cure i have one quick
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
question are we being recorded
 
00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
question are we being recorded
um

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
and i only ask because i think that i
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
might want to look back on a tape for
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
reference because we've got a lot of
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you that's it
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's all good
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
based on your introductory comments you
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
said that having met with the commission
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh you found that they had cut their
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
case load from 50 to 25
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i was curious as to
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
how that came about how did since we
 
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.590 align:start position:0%
how that came about how did since we
have

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussed in the fact that they have
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
this large caseload how did they go
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
about cutting the case though well
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
basically it's my understanding and
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
director malachi can can step in at any
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.110 align:start position:0%
point is
they

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
those cases still exist
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
but they are unassigned and so what they
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
were finding was that um
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
if the investigator had 50 cases
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
if the investigator had 50 cases
then

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
it was just a mush and everything was
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
just kind of out there and so when they
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
would put in for example a request for
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
information from a respondent the
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
respondent might not get back to them
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
right away and because they had so many
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
cases out there they would just kind of
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
leave that out there
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
so the thinking was um and again
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
director malachi you can chime up
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
the thinking was if i'm just focused on
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
20 cases that allows me to attack those
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
with greater clarity but it does not
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
mean that the amount of cases that are
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
being you know held within the purview
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the human rights commission has
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
diminished it just means that the amount
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
of active cases that each investigator
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
has has essentially been cut in half so
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
i i think it does but basically
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
they haven't reduced their caseload
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
they're just reduced the number of cases
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who are employed there are
 
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.789 align:start position:0%
individuals who are employed there are
handling

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
handling
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'd say maybe the the active
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
cases have been cut in half is that a
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
fair statement yeah the active case
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to representative smith yes
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you first of all i'd like to thank
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
you very much for the time you have put
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
into this over the last few months it's
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
been incredible
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not as if this is your day job
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
so i really want to thank you for that
 
00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:00.070 align:start position:0%
so i really want to thank you for that
um

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned this same
 
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned this same
uh

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
situation to me and i
 
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
situation to me and i
uh

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
i was troubled by it but thought that i
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
might have missed something
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
i know you talked about
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
efforts to get more staff people in and
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
i might have conflated the fact that
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
well if they're more staff people then
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
they're more people with
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
to divide the cases among
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
but i think we have to be careful about
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
the language we use um
 
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.350 align:start position:0%
the language we use um
all

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct and i hope i'm not but if
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm correct then all that is being said
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
is that half of the cases
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
are going to be ignored they're going to
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
be put on the shelf
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
and will focus on
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
another half and
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
meanwhile new cases are coming in
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.230 align:start position:0%
meanwhile new cases are coming in
so

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
i don't see this as
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
the caseload
 
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.630 align:start position:0%
the caseload
being

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
decreased it all i see it as the
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
caseload staying the same
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
but decisions for whatever reason made
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
to ignore half of the cases
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
tell me i'm wrong
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
no i i i think you're correct i think
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the decision was made at the human
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
rights commission
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
that for any investigator to have active
 
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
that for any investigator to have active
cases

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
to have 50 active cases in front of them
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
is just too much
 
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.470 align:start position:0%
is just too much
um

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
for any person to have in front of them
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
so they are holding cases back to allow
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
the investigators to be
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
more focused and the hope is that by
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
being more focused they're going to be
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
able to go through them at at a quicker
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
rate but you're right they they are
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
being they're being they're still held
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
at the commission and the new cases that
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
come in it's still on a first in first
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
out basis
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
so that means that those go to the back
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
that to me that would mean that new
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
cases coming in are going to be even
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
more at a disadvantage
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
because it's going to take
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
even more time did you in in our
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
conversations mr did you indicate
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
anything about a change in
 
00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
anything about a change in
staffing

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
the the director has put in a request to
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
increase staffing i think uh director
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
you were saying you were looking for
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
nine investigators was what you're
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
looking to try to go to
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
total total of nine so it's it's my
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
understanding right now that uh the
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
commission is staffed to five
 
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.950 align:start position:0%
commission is staffed to five
investigators

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so there is a request to move that
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
so what is the process on
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
of getting the additional um
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
investigators on board is that does that
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
have to be like in the budget or
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know the the budget process i
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
think the funding request comes in does
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
that have to wait for a budget year
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so mr chair
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
a year when um
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
the the biennial budget is drawn up
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
to go into effect
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
starting july 1st
 
00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
starting july 1st
2023

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
so at a time when my understanding is
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
that the state is having trouble hiring
 
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.390 align:start position:0%
that the state is having trouble hiring
people

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
finding people willing to work for the
 
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.350 align:start position:0%
finding people willing to work for the
state

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
at whatever salary levels
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's not until um
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
10 months from now
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you could even start the process of
 
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.789 align:start position:0%
that you could even start the process of
um

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
of having um
 
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.669 align:start position:0%
of having um
uh

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
admin administrative services you know
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
create the jobs improve the jobs start
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
the hiring process it is conceivable
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking again
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
of two years from now
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
before this changes and um
 
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
before this changes and um
it's

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
i'm very
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
very troubled
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
the classic understanding that every one
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
of us who believes in in this process
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
has is that justice delayed is justice
 
00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.990 align:start position:0%
has is that justice delayed is justice
denied

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
denied
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
and it's not just in criminal matters
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's in all matters and
 
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's in all matters and
i

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
i actually see
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
the suggestion of putting half the cases
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
on the shelf
 
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.430 align:start position:0%
on the shelf
as

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
even more negative
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
than the situation they have now i i
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
wish i had had time
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
to prep to to read and evaluate the
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
material that um
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
that jen just gave us
 
00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:23.909 align:start position:0%
that jen just gave us
um

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
comparing the process um
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh between the human rights commission
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
and the department of labor
 
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.750 align:start position:0%
and the department of labor
um

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
i i think of
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
why we created things like the housing
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
to speed things up to say
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
we've got to do this more quickly if
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to be fair
 
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
we're going to be fair
i

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
i am heartsick that people who think
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
that they can turn to the state
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
because they believe
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
rightly or wrongly
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
that they have a human rights complaint
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
nothing can be more personal and more
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
to find themselves in a situation where
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
with that the lack of resources um
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
confusion about process
 
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.950 align:start position:0%
confusion about process
uh

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
they are not good
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
forget about justice delayed it's
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
justice ignored so
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not happy and
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
when i add that to what the little i
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand and i'm the first person to
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
say i might be confused
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
about two years gets taken up
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
just to kind of figure out if maybe we
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
should think about the possibility that
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
there might be something worth
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
looking at
um

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
that i i i'm
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not being articulate i'm sorry i
 
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:14.230 align:start position:0%
i'm not being articulate i'm sorry i
apologize

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah surveillance park thank you mr
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh i absolutely concur what
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative smith has said
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
and and really i think that it's that
 
00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:25.590 align:start position:0%
and and really i think that it's that
concern

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
that has driven us to to to where we are
 
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.549 align:start position:0%
that has driven us to to to where we are
today

00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
i think the issue of whether or not the
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
respondent can remove cases
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
at the latter stages of the hrc process
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
stimulated us
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
but i think we could have dealt with
 
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
but i think we could have dealt with
that

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
had it not been for this issue that just
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh beyond our capability to fix
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
because we aren't the executive branch
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
00:25:57.679 --> 00:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
we can't
say

00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
and especially not in an interim study
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
we can't say no the department's got to
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
put 15 more people which might be the
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
the right answer to this is put 15 more
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
people on that job right away
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
to cut down the backlog and make it
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
something that's manageable
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
out of this study committee
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
say geez i looked at what they do in
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
other states and they somehow or they
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
get these things done in a year
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
because they have timelines and
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
deadlines that have to be met all the
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
we can't make those things happen
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it's frustrating
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
is make recommendations for what we
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that's about as far as we can
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
actually go
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
and for me
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
having and i i read through all that
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
stuff that the association for justice
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
sent out in the packet that's here on
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
the table and i looked at the numbers
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
and the stuff from the association for
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
justice and
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
the only answer i can see to this is
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to a expedite the process
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
by setting up making a process because
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
the process we have now is not clearly
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
not working so you need a new process
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
they need a new process with a much
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
tighter process with much tighter
 
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
tighter process with much tighter
deadlines

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
they need at least a short term
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
thumping staff
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
to reduce their backlog
 
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.269 align:start position:0%
to reduce their backlog
back

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
is that right whatever backlog back
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
all right those things are necessary and
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that's about as far as we
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
can go and as far and we could actually
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
try and deal with this idea of the
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
respondent being able to remove
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
um i like some of the things i saw from
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think it takes us very long to
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
conclude that that's what we should be
 
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.269 align:start position:0%
conclude that that's what we should be
doing

00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.549 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh i i just took a
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
only to disagree briefly with my
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleague about we can't
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
do something because we're not the
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
executive branch the human rights
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
commission was created by the
 
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.430 align:start position:0%
commission was created by the
legislature

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
we established the statutes that govern
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission and i think
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's our responsibility to make sure
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission works
 
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.190 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission works
properly

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
i think we have that duty i i am a
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
little concerned about saying we're
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
going to wait till the audits completed
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
before we do anything because i think
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're is a should be a greater sense
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
of urgency
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with the issues
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
the idea you know having read
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
through the materials that we did have
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
in advance today the
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
stuff that came from the
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
practicing attorneys
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know changing the statute from two
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
years to one year
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that that has any effect
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
because the two years being ignored
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
today so why wouldn't one year be just
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
as ignored as two years so
 
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.230 align:start position:0%
as ignored as two years so
um

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
that's just not happening so
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
i come from a background uh
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
the court background so my court
 
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.389 align:start position:0%
the court background so my court
background

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue that i've seen in
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
terms of this delay all comes down to
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
this issue of investigators and the time
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
that it's taking to come up with just
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
not a result resolution but just a
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
and and i understand we just got
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
something from the labor board but
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
typically in other boards and typically
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the courts
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
the parties are responsible for
 
00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:57.269 align:start position:0%
the parties are responsible for
discovery

00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
discovery
 
00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:58.149 align:start position:0%
discovery
and

00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.029 align:start position:0%
and
not

00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.909 align:start position:0%
not
to

00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
not the individual commission or the
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
board is responsible to do all the
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
investigation and the work the party
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
should be responsible for that
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i understand in these types of cases
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
where you have individuals who may not
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
be represented in many of those cases
 
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.710 align:start position:0%
be represented in many of those cases
that

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
we would want to support them by out
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
having somebody do the investigation for
 
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
having somebody do the investigation for
them

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that we could
 
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that we could
practically

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
practically
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
decide to appoint attorneys for these
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
people and have them do discovery
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
probably at a lesser expense than we're
 
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.190 align:start position:0%
probably at a lesser expense than we're
currently

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
having to have investigators and get the
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
job done and get it done more quickly
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there are positive
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
changes that could be made i mean
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
significant changes
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
i would rather not just say okay
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're just going to make a
 
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation that yeah we ought to
 
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
have further legislation about whether
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
or not
to

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
indicate that one party cannot
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
remove it to the other court i
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
we should go beyond that that's my
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
personal preference go beyond that and
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
deal with what i think is
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
really an urgent need in the state for
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
change in this particular body because
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
people i fully agree with representative
 
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
people i fully agree with representative
smith

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
smith
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
we're not providing people with justice
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
in this state and that's that's that's
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
chair and i've had a few quick thoughts
 
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.110 align:start position:0%
chair and i've had a few quick thoughts
um

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
and one is that could the investigators
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
come from the attorney general's office
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's one thought
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
another thought that i had it's not
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
parallel but um when director malachi
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
announced that um that case loads were
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
cut in half i thought i had this analogy
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
in my mind of
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
when um i left lucy was working in a
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
chocolate factory and they had to convey
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
about the chocolates going and she
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
couldn't keep up with the conveyor belt
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the picture that i have in my
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
mind of um
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know the case load being cut
 
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.509 align:start position:0%
you know the case load being cut
and

00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say that's not to
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
look at the hrc um
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
in a deprecative
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
manner but to
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
my my aim is to help
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
the hrc
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
with with this issue
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so i think you
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
know if we look at the agenda um that
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to kind of go through today
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
the first thing is just looking at 296
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
itself uh to see what can we do
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to that
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's the first part uh but then the
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
next part of uh the agenda we are going
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
to get into process um so we're going to
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
talk about that streamlining memorandum
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
and you know representative gordon we're
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to talk about what is the
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
threshold for probable cause how does it
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
differ and there may be opportunities um
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know within the subcommittee
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
um and so if we
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
kind of plumb those depths and we find
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
that there are things that we can do
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that are workable um i'm i'm not
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to to going forward with that
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
understanding you know that we have the
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
resources that we have and so um so i
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of where i'm at with
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
that does anybody else have any other
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
thoughts before we kind of you know dash
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
into the next part of the agenda
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
i just would make one more comment and
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
that was i was absolutely shocked
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
number of hearings that are being held
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
by the human rights commission
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely shocked and if i were to go
 
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
absolutely shocked and if i were to go
to

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.830 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
member of the public and say well how
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
many cases do you currently have pending
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the human rights commission
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
and they were to tell me
 
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.869 align:start position:0%
and they were to tell me
200

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i said well how many hearings did
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
you have last year and they said three
 
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.869 align:start position:0%
you have last year and they said three
then

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
then
i

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
i i i'm just i i just have to say that
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
my only comment is i'm just absolutely
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
and you know and i think that that's one
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why i i asked uh
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
jen if she could kind of go through to
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
look at the comparative path with with
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
the labor board um where they and she's
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
still kind of gathering that data but at
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
least we have a a
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
a map of the process but definitely they
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
do have more hearings but what are the
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
different thresholds is is that
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
something that we can leverage and i
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
think we can talk a little bit through
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
that you know amongst ourselves and
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
amongst the expertise we have in the
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
can i ask questions it might be of um
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
the former judge um
 
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.069 align:start position:0%
the former judge um
i

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
i read through the stuff that we had
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
before today so that doesn't include
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
this document which i think is going to
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
be very interesting
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me
 
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.589 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me
that

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know deliberate commitment to
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
the people who come before it
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
to get what i will as a layperson just
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
refer to as a preliminary
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
finding which isn't the technical term i
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
understand and then they start again and
 
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
go through the whole thing am i
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
are you asking me
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you because you're familiar
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
more familiar than i am
 
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
more familiar than i am
right

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
it it is not uncommon
 
00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:32.470 align:start position:0%
it it is not uncommon
in

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
the court system particularly in
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
criminal matters
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
to make a probable cause determination
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
before a case goes forward
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.430 align:start position:0%
before a case goes forward
so

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
having a probable cause determination is
 
00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
having a probable cause determination is
not

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
not
unusual

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.109 align:start position:0%
unusual
but

00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
in a criminal case
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
the complaint is made and generally that
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
in a felony a probable cause hearing has
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative smith in that there is a
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
huge amount of investigation
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
that goes in on the part of uh the human
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
rights commission for it's a finding of
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
probable cause so it's it's it's
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
definitely a different ballpark so we
 
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.550 align:start position:0%
definitely a different ballpark so we
can

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
when we talked when i was at the
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission we talked about some uh
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
investigations that they go out two
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
years depending upon the complexity of
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
the investigation so you're talking
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
some very very heavy investigation on
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
some of these more complex cases towards
 
00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
some of these more complex cases towards
going

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
to finding a probable cause and so it
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative walper thank you mr
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i'd just like to
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
just take that thread and pull it a
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.870 align:start position:0%
little bit
because

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
the standard of could we could
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
could not should but could
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
find that there is probable cause
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very low standard it seems to me
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
it would be very easy
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
to say well yeah reasonable it doesn't
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
take much to say that a reasonable
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
person could find that
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
right but yet
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
we're taking a very long time to to even
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
reach that without with what i think of
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
as a very preliminary judgment that
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
could be done in a
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know an interview with you with
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
the complainant and a phone call
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
or two right
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
so i know i i take your point and but
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna i want to follow up as we
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
get later on uh in in the work session
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
and we talk about process so i want to
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of hold those thoughts you know
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
for that point i want to revisit that
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
as we look at the process and what is
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
that threshold we can kind of flush that
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
later on in the work session but first i
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
just want to get before i get into that
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
i want to get into 296 itself
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
and just kind of look at that
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
what was the bill what would be the
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
burden on the human rights commission um
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
if if it was to uh come into being does
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
it need to be tweaked and then as i said
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
later on we're going to talk about the
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
process map
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
some thoughts about the process map and
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that threshold okay
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
all right so moving on
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
i just kind of want to go through um
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the fact sheet on uh sb 296.
 
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
the uh the fact sheet on uh sb 296.
so

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
miss j is it would you be willing to
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
come up and talk about that a little bit
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
or have somebody come up and just kind
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
of walk us through
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
would you mind just sharing some of your
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
so as we've talked about today
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
process is taking investigation process
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
well the assignment process is taking a
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
long time the investigation process is
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
taking a long time
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
eventually some folks are getting pc
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
findings and the respondent is
 
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
findings and the respondent is
removing

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
removing
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
the complainant
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
to court
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
starting the whole process all over
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
again which of course is going to take
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
more time and that's the problem that
 
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.430 align:start position:0%
more time and that's the problem that
we're

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're tackling here um
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
oh no i've been i think we've all been
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
through this a couple of times now yes
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
the reason for sb 296 and the impact
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
that it has uh would
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
would have a
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
positive impact that would have on
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
claimants are there any specific
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions that i could answer any
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
anything um
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
from this sheet that that you have
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
no just uh looking at your thoughts i
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
mean as i go through
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think what what came out for me and
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
then i'll just make my comment and then
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll open it up to uh the rest of
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
the committee members and and folks in
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
the audience what i'm looking at from
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
the time that i was um at the commission
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
they kind of walked me through and it
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
was my understanding that your intake
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
rate was about say maybe 25 cases a
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
month or in that ballpark would you say
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
so that's so we're looking at an intake
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
rate after they go through they
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
they get hundreds and hundreds of calls
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
but that's basically the intake rate um
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
and so if i'm looking here at any given
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
calendar year with respondent or moving
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
to court post finding
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
which really is what we're talking about
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's the the original sb 296 is saying
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm going to do i'm going
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
to take that away and so that now
 
00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:12.630 align:start position:0%
to take that away and so that now
becomes

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
the whatever burden
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the the commission to pick up i'm
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
13 you know i say 300 6 out of 300 1 out
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
of 307
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
so um as a percentage of the intake rate
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
the removal rate is pretty low so
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
just looking at
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
the data
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm not thinking
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
that from a resource perspective it's
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
going to be a big hit
 
00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:43.109 align:start position:0%
going to be a big hit
so

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
um i guess
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative i would say that that
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
is our what i hear from our employment
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys as well that's our belief
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
so so i would just give director malachi
 
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.550 align:start position:0%
so so i would just give director malachi
um

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
a chance to kind of share her thoughts
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
because she's actually living it um
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
based on on on those numbers what what
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
are your feelings uh at that removal
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
rate uh that the burden would be on the
 
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
rate uh that the burden would be on the
commission

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
do you want us to switch representative
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
sure yeah
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah you could go over there if you want
 
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
yeah you could go over there if you want
okay

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you very much for the
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
question ani malachi executive director
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
human rights commission
 
00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:44.630 align:start position:0%
human rights commission
so

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
just in a nutshell
 
00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.550 align:start position:0%
just in a nutshell
intake

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
intake
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
once a call comes in
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
those things are processed very quickly
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
once a case is assigned we also move
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
through that fairly quickly
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
minus any a tremendous amount in some
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
instances of back and forth with
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys primarily with with
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
complainants attorneys we have a lot
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
of amendments and such but it's the
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
middle part
 
00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:14.150 align:start position:0%
middle part
so

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
to answer your question specifically
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to have more hearings if
 
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.990 align:start position:0%
if we were to have more hearings if
respondent

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
respondent
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
needed to remain at the commission
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
then we would have more hearings
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
to representative gordon or chair
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
gordon's point
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
at him being saddened or upset or
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put words in his mouth
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
about the low number of hearings it is
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
because primarily we are an
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
administrative process so people have a
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
variety of opportunities along the way
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
to settle and we're happy when they
 
00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
to settle and we're happy when they
settle

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
settle
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
so we don't bar them from settling so it
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't go from intake to hearing
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
because if that were the case we'd have
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
a ton of hearings but there's a process
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
for the respondent to say we don't agree
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
with this allegation and for the
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
complainant to respond back to that and
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
go back and forth we do the
 
00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:04.470 align:start position:0%
go back and forth we do the
investigation

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the settle rate most
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
of our cases do settle whether it's in
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
mediation or the judge would understand
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
conciliation which is after a probable
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
cause finding we always schedule those
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
cases once it hits probable cause we'll
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
schedule them for a hearing but then
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's still an opportunity
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
between the time probable cause is found
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the hearing for them to settle and
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of them do settle which is
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
why we don't either the majority settle
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
some will be removed and then those few
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
will remain with us and go through to a
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
hearing so
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
we will not it's
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
on the hearing side
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
an exacerbating burden
 
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.910 align:start position:0%
an exacerbating burden
so

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative smith you go first just
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.910 align:start position:0%
representative smith you go first just
fine

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh to that response
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
and i hope you know that as painful as
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
this discussion is for all of us
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think everyone in the room and i i
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
know everyone on this committee
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
wants the human relations commission
 
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.910 align:start position:0%
wants the human relations commission
to

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
what the legislature
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
created it to do which is to provide
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
a recourse to people who need help
 
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
a recourse to people who need help
and

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.990 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
when we sound frustrated or distressed
 
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.589 align:start position:0%
when we sound frustrated or distressed
it's

00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
at the circumstances it's not at you
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
i hope you understand that
 
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.069 align:start position:0%
i hope you understand that
um

00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
if you get you get about 30
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
cases a year did you say no i mean
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 20 there are some months
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
we've had 30 um
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
an intake is we talk to everyone that
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
calls not every phone call turns into
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
charge so those those phone calls that
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
actually turn into charges there could
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
be anywhere from 20 to 30 a month it
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
really depends okay so if i could just
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
follow a couple i'm sorry
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
we also have attorney file charges so
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the person doesn't call us and
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
they may seek an attorney and then the
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
attorney will construct the charge and
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
send it to us and we immediately file
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
that so that's in that number as well
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay so let's so at 20
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
times 12 that's about 240
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
cases a year
 
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.510 align:start position:0%
cases a year
um

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
so looking at just
 
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.790 align:start position:0%
so looking at just
um

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
well actually 2021 is interesting
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not a full
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
year but let's just look at 2021 because
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's the end and it's easy for us
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
 
00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:44.309 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
um

00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
240 cases a year
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
you say that no probable cause
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
in 19 is that
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
part of what
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
we've been told
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
three cases
 
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.870 align:start position:0%
three cases
um

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.630 align:start position:0%
um
what

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
so that's my question
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
that that's my basic question so
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
200 you know 220 cases here we're
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
talking about 83 oh and then let's say
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.589 align:start position:0%
talking about 83 oh and then let's say
the

00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:32.710 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
respondent removed
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
to court and cases resolved during
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
conciliation so that's another nine so
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
let's say 95 it's not quite 95 but let's
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
say not so that leaves 105
 
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.670 align:start position:0%
say not so that leaves 105
cases

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for or uncounted in this
 
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.470 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for or uncounted in this
and

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
what happens with them sure so um my
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
name is sarah burke cohen i am the
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
assistant director at the new hampshire
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative smith to to answer it is
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
like director malachi said we have a lot
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
of different pathways for our cases um
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
so these cases are cases that have what
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
gotten through what we call a full
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
investigation it means that
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
it has been investigated because it
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't gotten out of any of the other
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
avenues the commission is lucky enough
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
to have a free mediation program that we
 
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.150 align:start position:0%
to have a free mediation program that we
have

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
had for a long time we've put together
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
for a long time we have volunteer
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
mediators that help mediate our cases so
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
oftentimes parties um will decide to
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
mediate the case to try to settle the
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
case and that is very successful our
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
success rate for that mediation program
 
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.670 align:start position:0%
success rate for that mediation program
is

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
at eighty percent
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
um so can i can i just finish just let
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
me finish um so the majority of our
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
cases we close about 240 cases a year so
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
we kind of strike even right on on cases
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
we're taking it excuse me in cases we
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
close okay the reason why they're not on
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
here is because they they settle or are
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
removed by complainant
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
prior to a finding so that means prior
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
to a finding of probable cause a
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
complainant has the opportunity to
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
remove it i know it says that uh
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
amending 354-a to eliminate the 180-day
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
wait period
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
so there is a hundred day-to-day wait
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
period for complainants to remove it
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
however a complainant can do it sooner
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
that than that with the consent of the
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
commission and some do
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
so we have a number of cases a
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
significant number of cases that's
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
settled and then some cases that are
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
removed by complainant and then those
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
that go through investigation are here
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
the 64 and 19.
 
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.190 align:start position:0%
the 64 and 19.
that

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.150 align:start position:0%
that
could

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's very very helpful and i thank you
 
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
that's very very helpful and i thank you
and

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
where

00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
where has the backlog been stashed if
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that what comes in
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
equals what goes out
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
then there should not be
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
a backlog so
 
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.829 align:start position:0%
a backlog so
where

00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
what why is there a backlog so the
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
backlog that we've been carrying we've
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
been carrying since our budget was cut
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
in about 2011 and our staffing was cut
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
so the backlog started to come up there
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
not and with with staffing changes we've
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
had uh we've had some time some points
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
in our our history where we've only had
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
two investigators we've lost staff to
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
various things
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
as you know this you know when
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to compete with private
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
industry so sometimes we lose staffing
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
to private industry so some of our
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
backlog is caused by our staffing that
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
we had limited staffing every year we
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
ask for additional staffing every budget
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
year we ask for additional staffing and
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten that so our backlog
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
sort of has traveled with us because we
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
are at this 240 240. so we're getting
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
them in we're taking them out
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's difficult to overstep
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
that with the with the staffing we have
 
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.750 align:start position:0%
that with the with the staffing we have
now

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
so just and just to clarify the
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
the reconciliation
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
process that's happening
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
while the probable cause investigation
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
is going on so that's then you go to
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
conciliation after the probable cause
 
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.710 align:start position:0%
conciliation after the probable cause
finding

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
finding
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
so again if the respondent just a quick
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
question then if the respondent
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
if it sounds
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
to me director malachi what you're
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
saying then is the impact of 296
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
is more on
 
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.430 align:start position:0%
is more on
the

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process that happens
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
after the probable cause finding so
 
00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:54.830 align:start position:0%
right now if you're looking at
 
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.349 align:start position:0%
right now if you're looking at
[Music]

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
cases resolved during conciliation if i
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
look at that line on the 296 fact sheet
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at say an average of 10
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
cases a year which are uh resolved by uh
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
conciliation right so so 10 cases a year
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh you're going through that
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
conciliation process
 
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.589 align:start position:0%
conciliation process
now

00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
if those could not be
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
removed to court
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
those would be added in on top of that
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
number right so that's
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
what you're saying at the impact would
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
be to the commission itself in that
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
conciliation process
 
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
conciliation process
so

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
every average of ten a year
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
let's say i'm out looking just quick
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
eyeballing it if i have an average of
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
seven cases a year removed uh after uh
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
finding by the respondent i would be
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
adding that on to the uh
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
the conciliation
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
load yes not sure that i'm understanding
 
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.870 align:start position:0%
load yes not sure that i'm understanding
but

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
maybe this answers the question
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
our conciliation process would still
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
take place so there's still that
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for settlement if i'm
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
understanding 296 it simply means that
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
they can't if conciliation fails they
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
are not able to remove it to court and
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
that they would remain with us to have a
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
hearing so they would still have
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
mediation before we even begin anything
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
they could still if there are two
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys involved they could still
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
settle if the complainant um is
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
interested in a settlement along the way
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
they can still make that known to their
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
investigator once there's a probable
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
cause we would still do
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
reconciliation if it settles it's done i
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
understand so what so so right now the
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the current process there's a
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding
 
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
the folks either remove or they stay
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
those that stay which is the bottom line
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
on on this sheet
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
um those that stay i'm looking at i'm
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
just doing a quick
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
eyeball math
 
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
an average of 10 cases are resolved
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
during conciliation per year so i'm
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that's the folks that stay
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
because you've only had
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know three hearings the bulk of it
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
is resolved by conciliation so i'm
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
assuming that and that's about 10 cases
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.109 align:start position:0%
a year
if

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
the respondent
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
is not able to remove if that's taken
 
00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.309 align:start position:0%
is not able to remove if that's taken
away

00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
the line right above it i have 2015 i
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
had 13 cases 2016 six cases 2017 one so
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
let's say on average
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
i have about seven cases a year right
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
now that are currently removed that
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
would go away
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
if 296 were to pass
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
so that would be added
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
now to the line below and that is the
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
real burden
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
commission would face if this was the
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
past am i am i over simplifying things
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
or is that
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i understand what
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying and so all right look
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative maybe you can explain it
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
better than i can so go for it
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
well no uh so all i can do is is say
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
that i am more confused now than i was
 
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.109 align:start position:0%
that i am more confused now than i was
before

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
and the reason is because
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to get at it says
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's responding remove the court
 
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
it's responding remove the court
post-finding

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
post-finding
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
does that mean post-finding of probable
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
cause where they actually had a probable
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
cause hearing yes and probably found
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.510 align:start position:0%
probable cause
no

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
that isn't what it means after finding
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
that means after a finding of probable
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
cause there is no hearing and a finding
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
of probable cause
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
after the investigation
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
there is a probable cause or no probable
 
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.630 align:start position:0%
there is a probable cause or no probable
cause

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
determination thank you that's a better
 
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:46.950 align:start position:0%
determination thank you that's a better
word

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
if there's a probable cause
 
00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:49.910 align:start position:0%
if there's a probable cause
determination

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
then there are three things that could
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
take place
 
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.309 align:start position:0%
take place
um

00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
if it is always scheduled for a hearing
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
it is always scheduled for a
 
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
it is always scheduled for a
conciliation

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
conciliation
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
and after probable cause
 
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:09.190 align:start position:0%
and after probable cause
yes

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
no hearing which is separate a hearing
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
is it's as if you are going to court
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's a brand new hearing on the matter
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
so there are people who had nothing to
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
do with the investigation
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the elements of the
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
case that are listening to both sides
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
coming together to to provide their
 
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.109 align:start position:0%
coming together to to provide their
evidence

00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.470 align:start position:0%
to say
um

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
to to have a determination in their
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
favor all right so let me try to clarify
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay so what happens is
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
a case is docketed before the human
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
rights commission it's going to sit in
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's going to sit in limbo for a while
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
until an investigator is assigned
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
the investigator is assigned the
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
investigator is going to do an
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
investigation that investigation could
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
take six months that investigation could
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
take two years depending upon the
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
complexity of the case at the end of
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
that two year or six month period
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
there is a finding of probable cause or
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
there is not a finding of probable cause
 
00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.309 align:start position:0%
there is not a finding of probable cause
okay

00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
is what representative mclean just said
 
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:26.789 align:start position:0%
is what representative mclean just said
accurate

00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
let me yes i think i i'm fairly certain
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
it is so we we investigate we
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
investigate a case right case comes in
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
let me go let me let me
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
let me throw it through the beginning so
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
case comes in as a as of charge right a
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
charge is filed it's docketed with a
 
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.390 align:start position:0%
charge is filed it's docketed with a
commission

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
so there's a period of time where it it
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
is unassigned it gets assigned to an
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
investigator the investigator
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
investigates talks to both parties talks
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
to witnesses reads all the documents
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
makes makes a recommendation to our on
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
our one of our commissioners who makes a
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
finding uh i'm sorry i'm gonna use
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
determination here a determination of
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
whether there's probable cause or no
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
probable pause probable cause moves it
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
along in the process towards a public
 
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
along in the process towards a public
hearing

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
and so at after probable cause like um
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
the probable cause determination is made
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
as a director malachi
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
said we schedule it for a conciliation
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
a mandatory conciliation and a public
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
hearing because the public hearing is is
 
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
hearing because the public hearing is is
what

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
makes the final finding we'll use that
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
maybe that that will help if we use
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
determination probably cause
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
determination and finding finding being
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing so
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
these cases that are removed by either
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
complainant or respondent take place in
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of interlude between the
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
determination of probable cause and the
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
so sometimes parties remove it before
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
the conciliation sometimes parties want
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
to stay and try to try to mediate the
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
case and try to settle the case
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
conciliate the case and settle it
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
this number of removals by respondents
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
is kind of a mixed bag of of those
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes respondents will wait and try
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
to settle the case at conciliation and
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes they will just remove it right
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
before the conciliation
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:21.359 --> 01:00:24.069 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think i think it makes sense i think
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding it right so the
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigation is done and a report
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
is given to one individual commissioner
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
right commissioner a commissioner
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
that commissioner decides
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
what does that commissioner decide to
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not there should be
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
a hearing determines whether there's
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause or no probable cause
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
moving it along in the process so if
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause it goes to a
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearing right it means there's
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence to push it along if
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
the commissioner finds there's no
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
it means there's insufficient evidence
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
to move it on the process the case gets
 
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
to move it on the process the case gets
dismissed

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
right so uh miss chase had her hand up
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let her
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll i'll let mrs chase go
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
first because she had her hand up first
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
time i'll go over to representatives
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
i was just going to ask representatives
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
if that made sense or if you just want
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
another another human with a voice to
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
take a whack at explaining that
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay is that do you have anything to
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
clarify no i would i would just add that
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
i haven't actually talked to
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
um the what's called the investigating
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner who actually issues the pc
 
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.670 align:start position:0%
commissioner who actually issues the pc
determination

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.549 align:start position:0%
determination
but

01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
and and maybe um either sarah ronnie can
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but in my
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
experience the
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
the it seems that the investigating
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner just reads the report
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's prepared by the commission's
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
employee investigator
 
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.630 align:start position:0%
employee investigator
and

01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
decides whether it looks
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
decent and rubber stamps it
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
based on the investigators
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations so there's not
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think the investigating
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner takes an active role in the
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
investigation or in the
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
the determination beyond reviewing the
 
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.630 align:start position:0%
the determination beyond reviewing the
report

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
if there were no
 
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
if there were no
human

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
human
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
relations commission
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
and if someone
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
let me rewrite in a more positive way
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
what is the reason
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
a human relations commission rather
 
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.549 align:start position:0%
a human relations commission rather
than

01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:02:56.559 --> 01:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
than
to

01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
expect the aggrieved party
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
judicial system
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
if the human relations commission exists
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
in order
 
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.069 align:start position:0%
in order
to

01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
more appropriately more efficiently more
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
effectively more accurately
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
in reality is that what is happening
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
or would it be possible without the
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
human relations commission that
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
would get to this matter in a in
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
a speedier way i'm going to take a stab
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
at this and let megan tell me why i'm
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
you speak more
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
um the human rights commission was
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
obviously established
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
people who felt that they were
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in the workplace
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
it might be a little bit of a lost fact
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
that if someone has a discrimination
 
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.789 align:start position:0%
that if someone has a discrimination
complaint

01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
that they believe they were
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in the workplace
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
they must start at the human rights
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
commission they must start at the human
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
rights commission and i think that
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
yeah see
 
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:27.510 align:start position:0%
yeah see
um

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know i i will say um
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean this disrespectfully at
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
all i some of our members have perhaps
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
facetiously said abolish the hrc and
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
have everyone go to court that has been
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
something that i have heard from some of
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
our members who practice in employment
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
law um i i do think that there
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know is um
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
merit to this to the system and we would
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
love to work on improving it for the the
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
reasons that we've outlined in here does
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
you could add something
 
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.069 align:start position:0%
you could add something
that

01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
in looking at the the creation that
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislative history
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
detailing the creation of the commission
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
based on my research the commission was
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
established to be a place
 
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.230 align:start position:0%
established to be a place
where

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.349 align:start position:0%
where
where

01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
everybody could go
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
and get a remedy
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
for for human rights discrimination
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
violations regardless of how much you
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
made regardless of whether an attorney
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
could afford to represent you
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
in in my view
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
it is a pla it should be a place
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
where the employee
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's being harassed at work but not
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily suffering a wage loss
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
which accumulates
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
value for the case
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
um economically um can can go
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
to ask for the harassment to stop
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
um that's you can't effectively
 
01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
um that's you can't effectively
practically

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
practically
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
go to a court
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
for that i don't in my view because the
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
court process takes
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
as a pro se litigant and
 
01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:15.029 align:start position:0%
as a pro se litigant and
um

01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
as a matter of
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
economics it's it's
 
01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:20.950 align:start position:0%
economics it's it's
it

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
some of these cases are are um
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know lower wage lower income earners
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
um with injuries that that don't
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily support
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
a private attorney
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
um being able to
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
to work to help these people
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
and the commission it could be
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
with with better
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
regs and a more streamlined process
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
could be a place where these folks
 
01:06:52.799 --> 01:06:53.910 align:start position:0%
could be a place where these folks
could

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
get a streamlined pc investigation
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's limited to pc
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
that they could then get the pc finding
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
and one thing that's being missed too is
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
that after the pc finding
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
the parties have the right to conduct
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
discovery including interrogatories and
 
01:07:11.359 --> 01:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
discovery including interrogatories and
depositions

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
depositions
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
after the pc findings so it's not as if
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know the employer is suddenly stuck
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
with the pc finding and can't conduct
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
any discovery there the rules provide
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
for discovery
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh prior to hearing which looks like a
 
01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:29.029 align:start position:0%
uh prior to hearing which looks like a
trial

01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:30.069 align:start position:0%
trial
okay

01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
but that the commission
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
if it if it worked a little bit better
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
could be a place for poorer workers
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
people with smaller claims
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
um to get justice
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
but right now it's just not functioning
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you completely i think
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature agrees with you
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
completely i believe that is why
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
the commission was created in the first
 
01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
the commission was created in the first
place

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
place
and

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
it seems to me if i'm being harassed
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
on wednesday the 14th of september
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
it does not do me very much good to know
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
that by the 14th of september
 
01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
that by the 14th of september
in

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
in
2024

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
we will get to a probable
 
01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.870 align:start position:0%
we will get to a probable
cause

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
which just says in fact maybe there's a
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
problem when you've been living with the
 
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
problem when you've been living with the
problem

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
not only for the
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
the two years that you've been since you
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
filed but for the time before that when
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
you hesitated to file because you hoped
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to file
 
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.030 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to file
so

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
if we are in agreement that that is why
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
the human re the human rights commission
 
01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
the human re the human rights commission
exists

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
and why these cases shouldn't go to
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
court and why they should be available
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
to people with limited means
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
and but with serious problems
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
how can we support
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.839 --> 01:09:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
that has carved in stone
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
an incredibly
 
01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:28.309 align:start position:0%
an incredibly
long

01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
time period
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
if you're i have
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
opinions on that if you'd like to hear
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
them well i guess
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
we can we can get into that as we as we
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
go through the process because i'm
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to keep things we get a lot of
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
ground to cover um and so i would just
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh director malachi had her hands up so
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recognize her
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so there are a couple of
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
things i think that are lost in the
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
conversation so far so the commission is
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
the attorneys present are only focused
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
on on employment that's not all that we
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
do that's one portion so if we're not
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
here then there's not somewhere for
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
someone to go for housing or public
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
accommodation we don't care how much
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
money you make so to
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
a comment that was made earlier it
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you're a busboy a
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
cleaning lady or the former president of
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
the company we don't have a vested
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
interest in how much that person earns
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't move how we move our
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
cases um if that person comes to us and
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
they and the law has been broken then we
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
are looking at that initially we're
 
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.950 align:start position:0%
are looking at that initially we're
taking

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're taking the complaint on the
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
grounds of what the person who walked in
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
the door has said to us
 
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
the door has said to us
and

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
by and large um
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
things things are are true but there are
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes people who are upset
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
and for whatever happened to them and
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
maybe that employer actually did the
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
right thing and it was a
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory reason that whatever
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
that outcome was
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
happened or in their housing it was
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory but that person feels
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
like they've been discriminated against
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we were to have it come in and we
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
docket it and then we just say it's
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
probable cause because you told us so
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
then we have now eliminated the rights
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the other party to plead their case
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
to say well wait a minute this is what
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
really happened according to their
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
perspective um the other part that is um
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think really
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
important to say that once a party has
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
received notice um it's up if it's if
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
the person is represented by council
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's on the council if they choose to
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
wait until we have um an investigator
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's a sign that's their personal
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
choice if they want to wait that long
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
but we send out notifications that say
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
if you have um if you want to do
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
depositions if you want to do discovery
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to take statements and and
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
notarize them and send them in please by
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
all means do you don't need to wait
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
until there is an investigator now if
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
that was something that happened in the
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
past i i there's nothing in our let me
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
let me restate that there's nothing in
 
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.149 align:start position:0%
let me restate that there's nothing in
our

01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
rules that state that you need to wait
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
the rules are very clear attorneys are
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
very smart and they can read those rules
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and apply that knowledge to sending
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
the information along we will collect
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
all of it and then move those cases
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
along as quickly as we possibly can
 
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.270 align:start position:0%
along as quickly as we possibly can
again

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
if the problem
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
from the beginning this the commission
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
has had a few employees and large case
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
loads and when they finally got six i
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
think it was in the 80s through the 90s
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
and then 2011 it was cut down and so
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the lower number of um
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
investigators that is at the beginning
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
of when the numbers started to creep up
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
so i think it's great that we're able to
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
take in and and also um finish that
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
number of cases per year would we do
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
more if we had more staff of course we
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
would then you can assign more cases
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
out of the files excuse me out of the
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
cases that are waiting so you have more
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
people which is turning over more cases
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's mediation
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's conciliation whether it's
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
hearings whatever it is those are those
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
all right um representative lorenzo
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i have um
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
a question that i'd like to pose and it
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
throughout all this process you know
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
while all these whales are turning and
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
are not turning and you know
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
stopping acts of discrimination
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
when we have people meeting for
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
conciliation or mediation um
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty for um
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
for breaking
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
the rules or breaking the law as far as
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
i can see in this process
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see and what i
 
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
would envision would be
 
01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.229 align:start position:0%
would envision would be
um

01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of like
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
punishment whether it's fines or um
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
maybe injunctions
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
or what they call you know just
 
01:14:21.679 --> 01:14:22.709 align:start position:0%
or what they call you know just
forcing

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
forcing
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
to stop whatever they're doing like
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
we do have power for injunctive relief
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
which we would work with the
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to do that and
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i mean there is if you want to call
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
it a fine if there's a mediation or a
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
conciliation there's money that's being
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
paid out so they are being i guess you
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
could call it fined for that activity
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's a negotiation there certainly
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's part of the process uh during a
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
hearing there are administrative fines
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners can assess um
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's a first offense ten
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a second offense i
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand if it's a third
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
offense fifty thousand um but it's at
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the commissioners
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they do assess a fine and all of
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
outside of a mediation or conciliation
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
that goes directly to the complainant
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
but if there are fines assessed that
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
goes back into the general fund
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
all right uh i had a quick i just want
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
to pull it back to uh
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
the fact sheet again so
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this if we took away the
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
right of the respondent to remove
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
um that means now
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
that coming into your conciliation
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
process which is because they can't move
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
it anymore i think based on this data
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at about six to seven
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
additional cases that would have to go
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
through that process on an annual basis
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
so is it is it your belief
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
at the commission that that is something
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you could absorb or is that
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
something that you think you don't have
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
the resources to handle
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
we can absorb that we do have the
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
resources to handle that okay
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the next question that i would have
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
then kind of goes into um i i forget who
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
made the the uh the comment so i'll
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
i can't give proper credit but um
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
everything does indeed have to start at
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission so even if
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
something is a very complex case
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
and you know you're talking to your
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer and you're saying wow this is
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is something that really we need
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
complex discovery here
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
but it has to go to the human rights
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
commission so i just put that
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
in light of that
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh revelation which was you know for me
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
came out of the discussions that we had
 
01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.669 align:start position:0%
came out of the discussions that we had
um

01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:56.630 align:start position:0%
um
would

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
just saying hey
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
you can choose the form out of the
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
get-go if you have a very complex case
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
and you think that the human rights
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
commission is
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
not the place for it
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
would getting rid of that
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
180 days
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
be of harm and and would it also um
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
take away perhaps some of the complexity
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
that goes before the commission so what
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
would be your thoughts if we were to
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
amend the statute that that part of 354
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
to just say hey pick your form don't
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
wait 180 days
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um so there's a couple of
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
pieces but the quick answer to the
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
question and assistant director burke
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
cohen will will clean up anything on
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
alp5 if that if there if i drop some if
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
i drop a jar of pickles um
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
take it so let me start at the end of
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
that one so
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
the 180 days yes that is statutory
 
01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
the 180 days yes that is statutory
however

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
what is also in the statute is if the
 
01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.669 align:start position:0%
what is also in the statute is if the
person

01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
they must dock it with us yes so in
 
01:18:02.239 --> 01:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
they must dock it with us yes so in
employment

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
public exceeding employment public
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
accommodation and housing you must
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
public education you have a choice of
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
forum which means you can file with us
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
or you can go to court okay
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the in employment because that's sort
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
of is where we're mostly focused one if
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
that person has an attorney that's with
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
them and the attorney files it or they
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
file with us and they pick up an
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
attorney and it's within the 180 days
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
they simply need to say hi commission
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm now represented by council so
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
um attorney bert cohen is my counsel and
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
attorney bert cohen says we would like
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
to remove it to court and it's been 30
 
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.229 align:start position:0%
to remove it to court and it's been 30
days

01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
will say
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much here's the
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
withdrawal form and we will close our
 
01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.510 align:start position:0%
withdrawal form and we will close our
case

01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
so it's not a burden to the complainant
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't create a barrier yes
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the statute says that but right below it
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
it says but you may request
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
and we allow them to request to remove
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
so any attorney that practices before us
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
especially those for the complainant
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
know that if they would like to remove
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
it to court at any time they are welcome
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
to do that and they simply need to
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
notify us and they can do it
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay one more and just to add on so
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we do have attorneys who
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
have evaluated their case when they take
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
it and feel very strongly about their
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
case and do
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
remove it within that that time period
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
i've had attorneys file a case one day
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the next day file with me you know
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
file a letter saying hey i want to
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
remove it now
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
to address your complex case you know if
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's a complex case
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
um we have oftentimes attorneys won't
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
remove their cases even if they are a
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
complex until they have gotten a
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding from the
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
commission so sometimes that bogs us
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
down in and of itself we can't force a
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
complainant out if it's a complex case
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
we've had some complex tenure cases that
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
have gone through we've had complex
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
other employment types of employment
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
cases that have come through our office
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
and we can't force a complainant to
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
remove so we investigate it that takes a
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time if it's
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
complex reviewing you know documents
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing personnel files reviewing
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
statistics and data so we can't force
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
people out a lot of times cases that are
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
complex will stay with us until a
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding is found so that
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
does take up an investigator's time
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
because if you have if you're
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
investigating a case and you have you
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
know personnel files you have to review
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
that are like
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
each person's been there 20 years it's
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
going to take a significant amount of
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
time um and to add one little tidbit
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that that happens is
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
because we are free discovery
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
the attorneys that are filing they don't
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the discovery in the
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
investigation that we do and we we
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
provide them with a complete report of
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
of what it was they have information
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
from both sides so anything we request
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
from one party they must be they must
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
send it to the other party as well so we
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
are providing discovery services i mean
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
obviously that's what we do because
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's part of our investigation but
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
that's something that if it's an
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
attorney file case that the attorney
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
does not have to do so if they go
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
through our process for the most part
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then pull it right before we've done
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
probable cause or immediately after
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
not allowing it to continue to go
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
through the process and i'm speaking
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
specifically of complainants attorneys
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
they're using the process i mean i guess
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's fine but that's part of it as
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
well yeah i mean i'd like to i'd like to
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on that in a little bit um but
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move on though so
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
so are are you saying that for
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
the complainants
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
who are able to retain an attorney
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
one lane
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
as compared with
 
01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
as compared with
complainants

01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
complainants
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
who do not have the resources
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
to hire an attorney
 
01:22:02.719 --> 01:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
to hire an attorney
no

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
same lane
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
just attorneys understand the rules and
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
if they want to take it and remove it to
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
court they can it's not that the
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
complainant or the person who's not
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
represented doesn't have an explanation
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
of what the rules are if they wanted to
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
and they're savvy and they want to
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
remove it and go to court they're well
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
welcome to do that okay so there's not
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
separate rules could i just follow
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you very much
 
01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you very much
um

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
how do you establish
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
your priorities i and the reason i ask
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
is because i'm not sure how you you've
 
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.790 align:start position:0%
is because i'm not sure how you you've
said

01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
several times
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
that it's first in first out
 
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.310 align:start position:0%
that it's first in first out
but

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how that could be
 
01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.669 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how that could be
if

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have first in
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
but case a only can get to
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
first base and meanwhile you have case b
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
that might get to second base
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
what does first in first out really mean
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
as a charge is docketed with the
 
01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
as a charge is docketed with the
commission

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
it is then
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
put in line with the rest of the cases
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
and if the case that if sarah has a
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
caseload of 10 cases and she's moving
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
all of those cases along some of the
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
cases in her caseload they may mediate
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
that case is done but we're talking in
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the terms of it being assigned to an
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
investigator what happens once it's
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
assigned there's a variety of things so
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
someone might choose to mediate before
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
the investigation starts or
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe their attorney may decide to
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
remove it someone else in her caseload
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
it may go all the way through and it may
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
end up in conciliation and they continue
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
on through our process so so what you're
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
you take cases
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the order they are received
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's the in part correct but that
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
really has nothing to do
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
with the out part in terms of final
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
disposition because each case then has
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
its own right its own speed it's going
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
through the process so it's not really
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
first in first out it's
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
in in the order that the cases come
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
they're taken in the order that they
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
come right and every case has the same
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.470 align:start position:0%
come right and every case has the same
process

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
some will
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
leave the leave our process sooner based
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
on whatever decision
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
if it's represented by council and they
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
want to remove it to court if there's a
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
mediation whether they're represented or
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
not so there's a variety of ways that it
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes miss chase yeah i i just want to um
 
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.629 align:start position:0%
yes miss chase yeah i i just want to um
agree

01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
that it is possible for the uh plaintiff
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
to remove the charge from the commission
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
prior to 80 days by sending a request
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
for for release um from to the
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
commission and um i haven't heard of the
 
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.950 align:start position:0%
commission and um i haven't heard of the
commission

01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
um denying such requests the pro as a
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
practical matter
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think what what can happen and which
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
has happened anecdotally
 
01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
has happened anecdotally
is

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
complainant files charge
 
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
complainant files charge
we

01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
a deadline is set for the defendant to
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
set to answer the charge which is always
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
very valuable to uh to the complainant
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
to know how the defendant what the
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
defendant's version of events is right
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
versus the allegations
 
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.709 align:start position:0%
versus the allegations
and

01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:38.070 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
in of late i'm noticing that defense the
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
defense bar has picked up
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
on the lethargy
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the commission so they're not they're
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
not they're just they're just not
 
01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:52.149 align:start position:0%
not they're just they're just not
reacting

01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
reacting
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
um to the deadline set
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
by the commission
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
so the complainant is
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
stuck waiting for an answer or waiting
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
for information from uh in waiting
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
for information which the investigator
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
has requested
 
01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.110 align:start position:0%
has requested
um

01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.629 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
by then it's 180 days in the meantime
 
01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.430 align:start position:0%
by then it's 180 days in the meantime
um

01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's possible that the
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
investigator isn't even assigned for a
 
01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.310 align:start position:0%
investigator isn't even assigned for a
year

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.910 align:start position:0%
year
so

01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
to get the value of the commission you
 
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
to get the value of the commission you
you

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes you do want an investigator assigned
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
and you do want information from the
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
defendant some information before you
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
remove in my experience in both most
 
01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.149 align:start position:0%
remove in my experience in both most
cases

01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
so yes it's true that you can remove
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
you must file at the commission period
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
you cannot elect to not file a
 
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.350 align:start position:0%
you cannot elect to not file a
commission

01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
it is true that you can remove
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the 180 day mark that is true
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
generally helpful
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
to do so because you at least want an
 
01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.229 align:start position:0%
to do so because you at least want an
answer

01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:27:04.239 --> 01:27:05.189 align:start position:0%
answer
um

01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
from the defendant which would happen in
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
your typical personal injury plan
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
right it would happen in court right so
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the case i'm not a lawyer so
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
bear with me
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
um and they always accede
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
to the request at the commission the
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
commission always received a seeds to
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
what is the value in keeping the 180
 
01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
what is the value in keeping the 180
days

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.390 align:start position:0%
days
um

01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
is there any value in keeping the 180
 
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
is there any value in keeping the 180
days

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
um i i think that
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
the reason why the 180-day deadline was
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
was um
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
established was to
 
01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.229 align:start position:0%
established was to
give

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:27:56.239 --> 01:27:57.189 align:start position:0%
give
the

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
employer the benefit of at least some
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
investigation before allowing allowing
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
the plain complainant to proceed
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
um but you know we're we're not seeing
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
that a whole lot of investigation is
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
happening before 180 days
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess the answer that question is
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
no and i don't see any value and in
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
other areas except to get the answer
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative i mean i would like to
 
01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:20.629 align:start position:0%
representative i mean i would like to
get

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:28:20.639 --> 01:28:21.510 align:start position:0%
get
like

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's yes um let me think about your
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
question your question is
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
do we should we have it written into the
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
statute that you have to stay
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
for 180 days if by commission rule
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to to
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
or it may be that may be written into
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
the statute i can't remember where i
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
just i mean
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
the the language of the statute i put it
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the handout yeah so it's
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know choice of forum you go to the
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh 354 a colon
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
21 slash a choice of forum so i'm not a
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer i think this is the relevant part
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the statute if i'm wrong you can kind
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
of correct me
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
but i think it says uh
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
or sooner if the commission ascends in
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
writing but not later than three years
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
after the alleged unlawful practice it's
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the statute so so it is there and i'm
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
just wondering if
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
if you're with your client and you
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
review your case
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
and you decide that
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
superior court is the way to go if the
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
folks at the human rights commission are
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
why why do we need this
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
and and is it gonna
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
is it gonna help streamline the process
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to question to
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
the second part of your question but i
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i think that this the the language and
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
the statute sets a deadline that's not
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
really a deadline
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
right or a mandatory stay requirement
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's not really a mandatory stay
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
because it's by its own language and and
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
they they they are seed 100 of the time
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
right i mean have you ever can you think
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
of a case
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
director malachi will you have not
 
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.310 align:start position:0%
director malachi will you have not
exceeded

01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
um not to my knowledge but the point of
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
it too is the percentage of attorney
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
represented um complainants is small
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
so those that are going to
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
leave are small
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
so whether you keep it or whether you
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
take it away it is small
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't streamline or change
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
anything and let's say it's not there
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
and there's a true choice of forum
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
the busboy is not going to court
 
01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
the busboy is not going to court
okay

01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
all right any other thoughts on that
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to do then i'm just
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the time so
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to get into a little bit of
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion about the process
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
and as as part of that uh
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
bring into that the whole
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about you know what is the
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
threshold for a probable cause finding
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things you know director
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
malachi you talk about is the fact that
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys are using commission to do
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
research for complex cases because
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
probable kind the probable cause finding
 
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.910 align:start position:0%
probable kind the probable cause finding
is

01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
really that there's a lot that goes into
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
it say in in contrast to maybe going
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
into court or something like that but
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
before i get into that i just kind of
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on a comment that
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo uh said and i
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to kind of plumb your
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that so
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds from some of the discussion
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
that we've had today
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
that right now the commission is at a
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
place where it's kind of level loaded
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
right so we got 240 cases in 240 cases
 
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.709 align:start position:0%
right so we got 240 cases in 240 cases
out

01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
but because of
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
the backlog that the accumulation that
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
has built up over time
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
um it just stays there it's like a big
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
pimple that you can't bust right so um
 
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.669 align:start position:0%
pimple that you can't bust right so um
so

01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
but representative dilorenzo was kind of
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
saying what about uh
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
using the attorney general's office
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
as investigators and so i was you know
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
while you may be adequately staffed to
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
level load
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
is their value perhaps and saying hey we
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
have this
 
01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
have this
backlog

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
backlog
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need some help with
 
01:32:33.679 --> 01:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need some help with
that

01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
so have you had any discussions or any
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts to that regard basically deal
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
with that backlog
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so to some degree um the civil rights
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
unit which would be the most logical
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
place to do any sort of um shared work
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
and there is no staffing there to do
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
that we are the staff that does the
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the work so to speak um and
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
there as far as i
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
um can
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
ascertain in speaking with
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
our aag sean locke there there aren't
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
investigative staff that would be able
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
to take this on so
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
whether you're adding and the
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
investigators there are retired police
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
officers which is great but the pay
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
level is significantly higher than what
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
we offer so then you get into that
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
conversation where you have our
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
investigators doing this those
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
investigators doing the exact same job
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
making maybe a i don't know half
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
a half more than what the current
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
investigators are
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's a whole nother conversation but
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh all right thanks for that so i think
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
then if
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
if nobody has any additional comment on
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
that i think i'd like to go into
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the last part of the formal agenda which
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
is kind of going through
 
01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.110 align:start position:0%
is kind of going through
um

01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the process um and
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
some discussions around the process uh
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is a memorandum that was uh put
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
out um by the association for justice
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
and um it kind of talks about basically
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
setting up some structure uh
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
bringing that timeline into a one-year
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
timeline but i just want to follow up a
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
little bit on
 
01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.510 align:start position:0%
little bit on
uh

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative gordon's comments so it's
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
a recommendation but if they're
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
if the resources are what the resources
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
are and and they're level loaded
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
practically

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
practically
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.910 align:start position:0%
do we need to
revisit

01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
the probable cause threshold
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
because it's very different my
 
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.629 align:start position:0%
because it's very different my
understanding

01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
from superior court versus the human
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
rights commission or does it need to
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
stay where it is because
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
the folks that go before the commission
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
are resource constrained so i think i'd
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
like to to start
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
just by having you folks go through
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
your memorandum your thoughts on that um
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
i know it went out to director malachi a
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
couple days ago i don't know if she had
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at it in any real
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
detail but if she has i'd like to give
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
her an opportunity to respond to that
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
and then we can kind of get into some
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
open discussion so i'll let you guys
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
so um megan douglas and samantha hearing
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
worked on this um this memo and do you
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to kind of talk through your
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
thoughts about how the structure is yeah
 
01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:43.669 align:start position:0%
thoughts about how the structure is yeah
um

01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:44.629 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
so the the commission
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
established by rule establishes what
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
probable cause means what it is
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
what it is is uh sufficient evidence
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
from which a reasonable
 
01:35:58.239 --> 01:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
from which a reasonable
fact-finder

01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
fact-finder
 
01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.709 align:start position:0%
fact-finder
could

01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
find discrimination that's a slight
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
paraphrase because we can call it the
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
maybe standard there may be
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination here
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah that that um there could be a
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
could be standard okay
 
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:14.950 align:start position:0%
could be standard okay
um

01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the commission rules i'll also say
 
01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.790 align:start position:0%
and the commission rules i'll also say
that

01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh issues of disputed fact are to be
 
01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
uh issues of disputed fact are to be
reserved

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
reserved
 
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
reserved
for

01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
the commission at hearing so to the
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh the the plaintiff says one thing um
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
happened and the employer says a
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
different thing happened
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
the the the investigator is is supposed
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to leave resolution of that
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
to the commission
um

01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
and and what so what does this
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
so if you're an investigator what what
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
do you have to do
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
well you have to look at the law
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
and the law in these cases follows
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
what's called typically follows what's
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
called the mcdonald douglas standard
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's a three-pronged
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
um analysis
 
01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
um analysis
and

01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.149 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's a primo fascia phase that's the
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
first prong
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
prima fascia means um
 
01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:18.390 align:start position:0%
prima fascia means um
basic

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
basic
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
on the pha on its face first face
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
there the employee uh if we're talking
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
about an employment case i do understand
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
that there's public accommodations and
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
housing cases at the commission
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
but if we're talking about employment it
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
the primo fascia case requires the
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiff to establish that they are of
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
a protected class meaning they're
 
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.350 align:start position:0%
a protected class meaning they're
um

01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
they they're of a race
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
they are of a national origin there they
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
have a gender
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that
 
01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
and uh that
they

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
i wish i could find my paper because my
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet because i think it would be
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
helpful at this juncture
 
01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:01.350 align:start position:0%
helpful at this juncture
um

01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
that they have been that they allege
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
that they have been
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
um suffered an adverse action or hostile
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
environment because of that race that's
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the primo fascia case
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
then the next phase is um
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
what the employee employee side calls
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
the pretext
 
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
the pretext
phase

01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
what the employer would call the
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason for adverse action
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
phase okay
 
01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:33.830 align:start position:0%
phase okay
um

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
at that phase the employer has the
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
burden of raising
 
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.470 align:start position:0%
burden of raising
um

01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
some basis
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the bad thing that the employee
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
alleges happened to them as a result of
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
their protected status
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
right some base some legitimate basis
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's not the protected status
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay that justifies the action the the
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
harsh or critical or unpleasant action
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
they took okay
 
01:39:02.239 --> 01:39:03.189 align:start position:0%
they took okay
um

01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then at the third
 
01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.070 align:start position:0%
and then at the third
phase

01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
the employee has to have
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
um the right
 
01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.470 align:start position:0%
um the right
to

01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
submit evidence that says you know what
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
that thing that the employer said
 
01:39:18.239 --> 01:39:19.830 align:start position:0%
that thing that the employer said
um

01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
was was legitimate
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
that's all phony baloney that's not true
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's a cover-up that's a
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know a cover your bottom
 
01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.669 align:start position:0%
you know a cover your bottom
um

01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
um
excuse

01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.629 align:start position:0%
excuse
okay

01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's the rebuttal so we've got primo
 
01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.709 align:start position:0%
that's the rebuttal so we've got primo
fascia

01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
fascia
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's rebuttal
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
in my view what the investigators should
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
is they should be looking at these three
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
phases and they should be asking
 
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
phases and they should be asking
themselves

01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.629 align:start position:0%
themselves
first

01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
is there some credible evidence that the
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
plaintiff is of a protected class
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
and that they suffered
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
a wrong
 
01:40:02.239 --> 01:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
a wrong
okay

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's is there some evidence of that
 
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:06.830 align:start position:0%
that's is there some evidence of that
second

01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
phase looking to the employer
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
is there some credible evidence
 
01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:13.590 align:start position:0%
is there some credible evidence
that

01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
they you know that they took the action
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
for a legitimate reason
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
whatever it is the employee complained
 
01:40:20.159 --> 01:40:20.950 align:start position:0%
whatever it is the employee complained
of

01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
if the employer
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
does not raise that
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
then the pc cause should issue
 
01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.470 align:start position:0%
then the pc cause should issue
immediately

01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.430 align:start position:0%
immediately
okay

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
but however what what usually happens is
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
the employer comes up with an excuse
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
admittedly okay so
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
the investigator says all right i have
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
some credible evidence of that now
 
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.510 align:start position:0%
some credible evidence of that now
employee

01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
why this is not
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
this excuse that the employer has raised
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
why this is not valid
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
give me a witness
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
that will will rebut
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
the validity of this give me a document
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
give me an email give me a text give me
 
01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
give me an email give me a text give me
something

01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
if the employee comes up with something
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's credible
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
the pc finding should issue because
 
01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.669 align:start position:0%
the pc finding should issue because
remember

01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
that the issues of the the ultimate the
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
ultimate decision is supposed to go to
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
the fact finder
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the investigators analysis should be
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
limited to is there some credible
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
evidence to satisfy the complainant's
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
burden in the mcdonald
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
douglas burden shifting framework and
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully i feel like that i've
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
noticed i'll use better words that the
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
investigators are going beyond that i
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
think i think they're overreaching which
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
is what's causing these
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
two three year long investigations
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that we should let we should
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
let employees be heard
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
the employer has the ability as director
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
maliki pointed out earlier they have the
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
ability to conduct discovery they have
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
access to
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
actually employers usually have most of
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
the evidence because they're the
 
01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:07.990 align:start position:0%
the evidence because they're the
business

01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.109 align:start position:0%
business
right

01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
employees don't own their emails
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't even own their
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
texts that they use at work
 
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
texts that they use at work
um

01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they're not savvy enough
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
to take good notes as to what's
 
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
happening and sometimes hr departments
 
01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:24.390 align:start position:0%
happening and sometimes hr departments
are

01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
so the employer
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
has the stuff they're they're really
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
why if an employee has been able to come
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
forth with some credible evidence
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
supporting their case why we're not
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
letting more cases go go to hearing
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
and what's happening now is even the
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
ones that are able to meet
 
01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:46.470 align:start position:0%
ones that are able to meet
that

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the investigatory standards that the
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
commission is applying
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
they're still having to go through it
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
all again in court some of them that are
 
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.470 align:start position:0%
all again in court some of them that are
removed

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.350 align:start position:0%
removed
and

01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
thanks director malachi do you have a
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
chance to look at that and have any
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts i do
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
so the three
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
areas that
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
attorney douglas mentioned
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
that is our investigative process so
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe she put it in smaller words
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
but that is how we do our process so
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's her desire or her
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how it should work is how it
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
works now
 
01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:28.390 align:start position:0%
works now
um

01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
the way that the statute is written
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
right now so uh and a um
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
a respondent is noticed that there's
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
been a charge of discrimination
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
the way the statute is written
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to participate they
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to they can not give us
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
anything until there's a public hearing
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
that would be their choice not a wise
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
decision because what we what would we
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
do then is your question anything that
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
the complainant says happened to them we
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
deemed that admitted and that's a really
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
easy breezy probable cause because
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing from the other party to
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
refute what was stated
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
and um and so she attorney douglas
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
eloquently discussed the the pendulum
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
that we use basically that swings back
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
the complainant says one thing the
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
respondent has an opportunity to respond
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the complainant to give
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
us a witness an email or something
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes those who are represented
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
who may
 
01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:30.070 align:start position:0%
who may
have

01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
people that they would like to call as
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses either they're unable or
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
unwilling to provide that information to
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
us we will do our our very best to reach
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
out to those people but if they've taken
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
statements then it would be helpful to
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
provide those to us or contact
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
information we'll certainly reach out to
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
both parties to gather that information
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
to then move our investigation along so
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
the issue here really isn't
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
the investigative process it moves along
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
at a at a much better pace so previously
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the statement that
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
the investigation does i'm not talking
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
about pending cases
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
so speaking to what
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
attorney douglas stated
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
the way that our reports were written
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
before they were very long and the way
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
they were written before they were going
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
basically to a hearing standard which is
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
a much higher bar
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
to prove probable cause
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
what what i've done is look at it with
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
the help of the staff and we've actually
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
put the reports the report writing and
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
the investigation that the that the
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
investigator is doing back to where it
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
is or where it should be which was a
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause standard so you have
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
prima facie just getting in the door
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
probable cause is a little bit higher
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then 50 plus one percent which is
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
what you deal with at a hearing that is
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
a much higher standard we have put the
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
standard back where it's supposed to be
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
so if you as a complainant have
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
something and it's the rebuttal time
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
that shows okay i think this this looks
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
like it's enough to get to probable
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
cause then we're finding probable cause
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
if you say as a as a complainant
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
well there's some witnesses out there
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
and you're not able to give us any
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
contact information or names or there's
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
no way for us to find the person and all
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
you have is bob well if we've requested
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
the records from the employer and we can
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
sort of figure out it might be bob moore
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
but there's seven bobs we'll try to
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
reach out to bob but if you don't have
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
any way to help us then how are we to
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
know which bob it is that was present at
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
the time of whatever the incident was
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.470 align:start position:0%
that happened
so

01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
 
01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
um

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
we this the process that was described
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
is the process that we use
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
the pending time is the time that is
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
what is distressing everyone not the
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
investigation time
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
anytime that there's an amendment to a
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
charge we must start our process from
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning and you give all the
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
parties an opportunity to respond to
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
that so that elongates the investigation
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
time but the pending time is what the
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
issue is not the investigation time
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
those can take up to a year some or less
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
than that some are a little bit longer
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
but on average it's about a year maybe
 
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.870 align:start position:0%
but on average it's about a year maybe
less

01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
so um yeah and so this timeline in the
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
timeline it doesn't take the the pending
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
into account because it's basically
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
assigning the investigator in the first
 
01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.470 align:start position:0%
assigning the investigator in the first
quarter

01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
so um so you you mentioned that you had
 
01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.510 align:start position:0%
so um so you you mentioned that you had
already

01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
shifted uh the probable cause standard
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
to match the statute that that
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the past it had been at a hearing
 
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.910 align:start position:0%
in the past it had been at a hearing
level

01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
um did i understand that correctly
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
the so the investigators certainly were
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
doing a thorough investigation but what
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
they were having to
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the determination level that they
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
were required was a much higher burden
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't have been that high it
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
was re it was put back where it was
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so probable cause became
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
a 50 plus one standard
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's more than likely something happened
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
so one of the things i i was kind of
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
asking for when i met with
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
a few weeks back
 
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
a few weeks back
was

01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
just just looking um
 
01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.430 align:start position:0%
just just looking um
for

01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
i was asking about the length of the the
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
investigation process and so
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
as part of that discussion you know
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
saying hey it could be here it could go
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
up to two years it kind of runs the
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
gamut do you have do you have any data
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of says this is what my
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
investigation time was prior to that
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
realignment um and what that
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
investigation time was after just so we
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
could kind of get a feel for uh
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
has there been any shifts
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have
 
01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.350 align:start position:0%
i don't have
um

01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
i don't have that specifically yeah
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
but what i i do have anecdotally is in
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
working with the staff um the report
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
writing so the number of reports that
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
are coming in
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
have have increased um and the report
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
writing isn't taking as long because uh
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes you get up 10 pages of a
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
report right and and there's
 
01:49:34.239 --> 01:49:35.109 align:start position:0%
report right and and there's
just

01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
10 pages of a report the reports are a
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
bit more condensed but all of the
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
information is there we put in the
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
report the legal standard that's being
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
used so whether the person is
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
represented by council or not they will
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
understand what it is we've done and the
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
standard that they did or did not meet
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
whichever party it is so it's very
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
clearly stated in paragraph form
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's less
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
dense and a bit easier to consume
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
it would it would really help as we're
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to really understanding where the
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
roadblocks are in the process
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
if we kind of had
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
a break-in date as to when there was
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
that realignment of the process and if
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
you have data that says this is my
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
investigation time prior to that
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
break-in date this is the investigation
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
time after you know it's it's a way to
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of assess how effective that
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
has been and and it would give us you
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
know on the committee a feel just yeah
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
actually this is this is on the right
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
track and really
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the barrier here really is the
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
backlog we're level loaded we're
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually seeing the investigation time
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
come down and so that might actually
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
start to shift things on its own
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
or actually no it hasn't so we're going
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
to stay level loaded for a long time
 
01:50:59.590 --> 01:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
with that backlog going on so i think i
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
think if we could get that data that
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
just my personal thought i i'd like to
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
see if there's a process shift there so
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know how easy that would be to
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
get but it would be welcome
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know i just had a couple questions
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the commissioners themselves
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
i i only recognize one name on there but
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
how many of the commissioners are
 
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:34.709 align:start position:0%
how many of the commissioners are
attorneys

01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
i mean you mean currently or in general
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
currently uh we have one attorney and we
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
have one jd
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
is it very common for them to deny
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
a request from an investigator to find
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh not usually i mean if there's
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
questions or if there's an issue
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
i was trying to figure out what their
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications were to
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
determine probable cause that was they
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
understand the legal standard they've
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
had a training to understand that we
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
have the ag's office to assist us um and
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the issue is you're
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
not able to do this work if you're not
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
an attorney
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of people in our office
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
who are not attorneys who do this work
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
and you also run the case you also run
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of the attorneys that would
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
potentially be on the commission
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
would more than would potentially be
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys attorneys that could practice
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
before us which means they couldn't be
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
on the commission
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
so you would still have if it was
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys that you're looking at they
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be someone in some other
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
field that has nothing to do with what
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
we do which still means they'd have to
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
understand the legal standard they would
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
still have to
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
take a training to understand what it is
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
we do and how we evaluate cases
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
if i could ask some additional questions
 
01:53:15.679 --> 01:53:18.950 align:start position:0%
if i could ask some additional questions
so

01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
when

01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
and there were to be a hearing
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
at that point in time who prosecutes
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
that hearing is it the
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
investigator or is it the individual
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
complainant that prosecutes them
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
um if i understand what you're asking we
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
have a hearing panel and there are three
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
commissioners that are on the the
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
hearing panel if the person and these
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
commissioners are not any none of them
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
are ones that were involved in the fact
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
finding of the initial
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
charge the determination
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
if one party if the complainant is not
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
represented by council then by statute
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
the commission puts on the case for the
 
01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.229 align:start position:0%
the commission puts on the case for the
unrepresented

01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
01:54:12.239 --> 01:54:19.350 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
complainant

01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
so in circumstances where we were not to
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
we were not to allow employers to remove
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they were unrepresented that would
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
put some additional burden on the
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
commission with regard to
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for prosecuting the
 
01:54:40.719 --> 01:54:43.270 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for prosecuting the
complaint

01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
there would be responsibility on the
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
commission for
 
01:54:46.639 --> 01:54:47.830 align:start position:0%
commission for
representing

01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
the the unrepresented individual
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
but that would happen regardless so if
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
it means we need to
 
01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.830 align:start position:0%
it means we need to
adjust

01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
who that person who that individual is
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
because there's not something currently
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
in statute then i don't think that's a
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
heavy lift
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.550 align:start position:0%
so
in

01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
listening to attorney douglas basically
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the probable cause
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
investigation she mentioned
 
01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:16.830 align:start position:0%
investigation she mentioned
the

01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
initial the uh complainant is going to
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
file the complaint per se which i'm
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
presuming is under oath at the time
 
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.830 align:start position:0%
presuming is under oath at the time
and

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
so they file a complaint
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
the employers
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the burden is on the
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
complainant to do that
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's not something the commission does
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
the employer is given the opportunity to
 
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.229 align:start position:0%
the employer is given the opportunity to
respond

01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm presuming that the burden is on
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
to do that work and not the commission
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
an explanation for why they did whatever
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
they did
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
and then the third prong is
 
01:56:03.599 --> 01:56:04.310 align:start position:0%
and then the third prong is
the

01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
then the complainant gets to respond to
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm presuming again and the burden is
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
again on the complainant not on the
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission to provide that information
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then as as i understand the
 
01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:22.629 align:start position:0%
and then as as i understand the
testimony

01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
the investigator then looks at
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
these three circumstances three
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
documents whatever whatever has been
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
provided the evidence has been provided
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
and makes a determination as to
 
01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.550 align:start position:0%
and makes a determination as to
whether

01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
not as to whether or not the facts are
 
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.709 align:start position:0%
not as to whether or not the facts are
accurate

01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
a determination of facts but makes a
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether or not it
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
would legally qualify
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
by virtue of probable cause
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
that you could make a probable cause
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
determination that the law was that
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
basically the law was broken
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
is that a fair
 
01:57:00.159 --> 01:57:07.510 align:start position:0%
is that a fair
assessment

01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.430 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused by the tail end of
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
that because we're at probable cause so
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're not assessing whether the law was
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
actually broken that's at a public okay
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has set a standard for
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause so and which is less than
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
more likely than not but greater than a
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion correct so
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
if i'm following what you're saying
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
the commission essentially facilitates
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
everything throughout right we
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
facilitate we take the charge in we tell
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
the respondent to give us an answer
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
respondent gives us an answer we tell
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
the complainant to give us a rebuttal
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
you send them send them a letter right
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
so we facilitate that we review
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
everything and then make a determination
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
from there looking at the evidence
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
talking we also you know interview
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses along the way interview
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
complainant we have to interview any
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
specifically named party so we interview
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
all those folks and take all of that
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
evidence in
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
and use it to determine that probable
 
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.350 align:start position:0%
and use it to determine that probable
cause

01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
is that what you're i guess i'm not sure
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
what specifically you're looking for if
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay i i guess what i'm trying to look
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
at is why
 
01:58:15.199 --> 01:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
at is why
why

01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you're not making factual
 
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.790 align:start position:0%
if you're not making factual
determinations

01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
the burden is on the commission
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
to do interviews with witnesses at that
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
point in time as opposed to
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
taking the information that's been
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
to make a determination of probable
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
cause not a determination of whether
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
a final determination but just a
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
determination of probable causes to go
 
01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:57.589 align:start position:0%
determination of probable causes to go
forward

01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.599 --> 01:58:59.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
to some extent i understand what you're
 
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.470 align:start position:0%
to some extent i understand what you're
saying

01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
um you're looking to see if we are
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
making factual determinations during a
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause investigation which are
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
the the short answer is we use our
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
witness testimony right because
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes in other pro se complainants
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're submitting rebuttals that don't
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually answer the question or rebut
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
anything right
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
so we interview those folks to talk to
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
them about what the rebuttal like
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
your employer said this about you know
 
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is what your employer said i asked
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
you for a rebuttal and it it was about
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
this hearing today and so talk to me
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
about your time there because part of
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
another component of the mcdonald
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
douglas test and employment cases
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
is whether a an employee is is
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
performing adequately at their job and
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
performing their job right so we look at
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
that too so we talked to them about hey
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
are you performing adequately what were
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
you doing at your job were you at work
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
if it's an absenteeism case were you
 
01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.510 align:start position:0%
if it's an absenteeism case were you
absent

01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
absent
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know were you absent why were you
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
absent was it if it's a disability
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
related absence were you absent because
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
of that or not because we have a lot of
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
pro se folk that can't
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand how to put a rebuttal
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
in writing so
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
yes we need to interview those people
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
to make a determine to to find out what
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
their actual rebuttal is
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up and that is
 
02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up and that is
but

02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
do you need that to make a determination
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
of probable cause why would you not rely
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the information that's provided to
 
02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.550 align:start position:0%
on the information that's provided to
you

02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
by the litigants to make the
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
determination probable cause and then if
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
in fact there is probable cause
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
to do that
investigation

02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not there is
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately merit to the case which would
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
require you ultimately to prosecute the
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
case on behalf of the libya
 
02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:58.470 align:start position:0%
case on behalf of the libya
so

02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
as attorney douglas says we're looking
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
at all credible evidence so part of that
 
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
at all credible evidence so part of that
is

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
talking to people to determine whether
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
the evidence is submitted is credible
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's determining that an
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
employer is submitting to submitting
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
documents that weren't actually in a
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
complainant's personnel file did you
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
receive this document no i didn't
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay so that puts that puts something in
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
our like wait maybe those documents
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
aren't credible so part of it is
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
determining that whether the evidence
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
walper

02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
the investigators take as long as we're
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking to try to figure out where we are
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
because we're sure
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
befuddled here
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i would like to ask
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh to go back to the fact sheet for a
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
minute okay if i could
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
and ask
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
well not the faction i'm sorry i mean
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
the memorandum
 
02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.109 align:start position:0%
the memorandum
um

02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
and asked
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
what would cause you to believe
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
but the time limits that you have you
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
have these very detailed descriptions of
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission would
 
02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:52.629 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission would
be

02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:02:52.639 --> 02:02:53.750 align:start position:0%
be
any

02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:55.430 align:start position:0%
any
better

02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.709 align:start position:0%
better
able

02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
able
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
to honor this
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
schedule than the schedule that
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
02:03:04.159 --> 02:03:05.589 align:start position:0%
already exists
well

02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
i i maybe i'm wrong but i i thought i
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
just heard director malachi say that
 
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
investigations are already taking about
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
a year
so

02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where um
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
getting the data you know would would
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
i really be interested to see if there
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
was a shift in where they're putting the
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
probable cause threshold just to kind of
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
see has has that investigative period
 
02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.709 align:start position:0%
see has has that investigative period
shrunk

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
shrunk
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
along with that and i think that would
 
02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.310 align:start position:0%
along with that and i think that would
be

02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
really important data just to understand
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
what is the impact and where it where is
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
the real log jam because you're right
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
director malachi you did say
 
02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
director malachi you did say
that

02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're here we're on board
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
chunk by chunk by chunk this is our
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
process so i i think i would like to see
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
that data and let's let's just take a
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
look at it i just follow up because i
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
you really confused me because
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
that what this was
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
was a
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
a division of time
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
in which to resolve
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
the matter
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
not a division of time in which to do
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
02:04:26.159 --> 02:04:27.830 align:start position:0%
the initial
investigation

02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
so where am i wrong and i'm just saying
 
02:04:32.159 --> 02:04:33.750 align:start position:0%
so where am i wrong and i'm just saying
um

02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think that now is a great time to
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
remember that the fact that this is so
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
complicated really speaks again to how
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
difficult it is for people to get
 
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.430 align:start position:0%
difficult it is for people to get
justice

02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
justice
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to lay that out there it's
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
very complicated and it doesn't need to
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
be that complicated this is
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
investigation should take
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
no more than a year and a hearing should
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
be scheduled within 60 days after that
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my notion of of a
 
02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:03.109 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my notion of of a
reasonable

02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
um time frame
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
why do you say resolve the charge
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
maybe that's poorly representative uh
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it says here the
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
at the the end product of the timeline
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
that eternally douglas has
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
put out is the consumer can then review
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
the investigative report and issue a
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause determination by the
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
final day of the fourth quarter so the
 
02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:29.669 align:start position:0%
final day of the fourth quarter so the
product

02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year is the probable
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
cause determination
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
then the paragraph at the beginning the
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph is perhaps a
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
little misleading
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the one that paragraph that
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
immediately precedes the first quarter
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
so i think i think
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
as as i read the document the the the
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
product being asked to be delivered at
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
the end of this four quarter cycle
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
is the probable cause finding and
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
director malachi you were saying that
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that you you've looked
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
at and you've already incorporated this
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i think at this point i just would
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
where are we at now
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
that is if that is now our current state
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
what is that doing for us and so i think
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
that would be good data to have
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
because i believe
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
from your testimony that that is current
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
except

02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
except
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
what i see as
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with the process
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
 
02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:00.229 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
and

02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
and if
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
and and may and again i'm probably wrong
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
again i don't know but
 
02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:07.910 align:start position:0%
again i don't know but
if

02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
if what we're agreeing is okay it's okay
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
now if the investigations are only
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
taking a year
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
the question is when are the
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
investigators getting assigned before
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
they take the year you know that's
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
another whole issue so
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh and that's if we're only doing half
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
the cases at a time that's right so well
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be working for me
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
but that's uh well that and and that is
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is the big question so where do we
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
focus our resources do we
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
is it really an investigation issue is
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
it really
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh the wait time on getting the
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
investigators assigned so i think
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
that's what we got to figure out well
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
this and i think part of it is i'm
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
getting too old
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i have this limited horizon now
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of my life and so every every
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
year is dear to me right now and when i
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
look at this process i say if i was a
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
litigant and i had a complaint with my
 
02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.709 align:start position:0%
litigant and i had a complaint with my
employer

02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
i would think i would be able to resolve
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
that complaint within one year
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the state should have a process in
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
place that says
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
if i have that complaint i can get some
 
02:08:24.550 --> 02:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
type of answer within a year and to
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
think that i have to go two years or
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
more at this point in time i think
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
is uh
is

02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
is a is a
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
an insult to those workers out there
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
that have the process
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that we can
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
streamline that probable cause process
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
to make it work
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and do it in a time frame i think
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
government is failing the people in the
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire in the way it's
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative wilpert
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i have to totally agree with
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative gordon on this right
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.149 align:start position:0%
to me
and

02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith said the same thing
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to take a year
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
to find out whether you can even really
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
have hearing about
 
02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
have hearing about
to

02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's not good at all
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
right i i would think that we should be
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
able to do this in a matter of
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.199 --> 02:09:26.709 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
as i've read all of this the
 
02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:31.189 align:start position:0%
as i've read all of this the
investigator

02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
is not responsible
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
for resolving
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts of fact
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
so if the employer says
 
02:09:42.159 --> 02:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
so if the employer says
a

02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the employee says that isn't right
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
it's not up to the investigator to
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
determine who's telling the truth
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's not part of their job
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
their job is to say well if
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
you are telling the truth
 
02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
you are telling the truth
then

02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a good case you you've got a
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the commission will do the
 
02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.229 align:start position:0%
and the commission will do the
investigation

02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:10:10.239 --> 02:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
investigation
or

02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
carry it on and i don't see why it
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
should take that long at all
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
right and the assignment business is
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
just as important it doesn't do any good
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
to say well we could do this in three
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
months but i'm not going to assign it
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
for eight months
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
so you got 11 months
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
does anybody else say the other comment
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the goal when when we sat down with the
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
staff with the help of the ag's office
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
was to look at our internal process to
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
see if there are any hurdles that we
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
have internally whether it's intake
 
02:10:58.639 --> 02:11:00.069 align:start position:0%
have internally whether it's intake
investigation

02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
um moving it onto a hearing what are our
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
things internally if anything that are
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
slowing down our process
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
and i tasked myself and tasked the staff
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
with the help of the ag's office in
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
looking at the entire investigative
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
process and figuring out okay how can we
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
do this in six months
 
02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:22.310 align:start position:0%
do this in six months
so

02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
what we have right now is moving into
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
the process of wanting to get things
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
done in six months
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
with the current staff that i have and
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're looking at their cases and
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
moving those along um
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
we could potentially do it in six months
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
the issue comes back to
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
the cases that are pending
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
and how do you
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have anything coming in if
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
we had maybe five cases a month come in
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
for a year
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
current staff we could probably knock
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
out everything that's pending with the
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
the new process and move it along but
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's not the case so as um
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative mclean said
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
if you're if what's coming in is roughly
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
what you're closing
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
with the staff that you have
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that includes turnover
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
people moving on for whatever reasons
 
02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
people moving on for whatever reasons
then

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
that means that that process is working
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
and you're going to move the process
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
more expediently
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
then what else what else can you do
 
02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
then what else what else can you do
well

02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
if you limit amendments maybe or you
 
02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:30.229 align:start position:0%
if you limit amendments maybe or you
change

02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
certain elements those are possibilities
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
but then where do you get into
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
taking away rights for complainants or
 
02:12:38.159 --> 02:12:39.510 align:start position:0%
taking away rights for complainants or
respondents

02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
respondents
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to have their opportunity to
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
have their voice heard
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's for the smart people in this room
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
because those are the elements of our of
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
our statute
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
and then along with that
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
i mean we certainly wouldn't want
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
any of that to happen
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
but looking at what's in the pending
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
file what's waiting to be assigned if
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
you have more hands in there pulling out
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the file then you're able to
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
move those all along putting them in the
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
same system in the new system or updated
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
system whatever you want to call it and
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're moving those cases along as as
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're finishing cases each month
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're assigned a new case each month
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
so nothing is sitting for a year until
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
they finish all the cases everyone you
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
close you get three or four more every
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
month and some people may close even
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
more and they'll get more cases in that
 
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:36.629 align:start position:0%
more and they'll get more cases in that
month

02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we're signing out as quickly as
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
people are closing cases
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes miss chase
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
director malachi i that i mean that
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me as a
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
human um
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna ask um if it's okay with you
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative um i think that's really
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
interesting about changing the process
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
for filing amendments to claims because
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
megan was nodding
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i'm going to ask attorney
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
douglas to talk about the amendments to
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
claims because i saw her nodding
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
vigorously perhaps that's an area where
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
we agree and i just really briefly want
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
to go back to the cases coming in
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know earlier we had talked about the
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
180-day filing period and i think you
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
know the whole idea of removing after
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's filed perhaps if a complainant who
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
is represented by an attorney
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
does not have to initially file with the
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
human rights commission if it is going
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be a complex case that they could
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
just file directly to superior court
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
that would alleviate that whole issue
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
that you know attorney malachi mentioned
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
of providing free discovery and
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
overburdening resources on the human
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
rights commission so that was just an
 
02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
rights commission so that was just an
idea

02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but i think that
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
public school students
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
who are victims of discrimination have a
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
direct path to court
 
02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:54.390 align:start position:0%
direct path to court
whereas

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
adults in employment situations do not
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
under the statute which could be
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
something that could be made consistent
 
02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.270 align:start position:0%
something that could be made consistent
right

02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
what what else did i oh the amendments
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
um as uh
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
look i the rules right now allow
 
02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:14.069 align:start position:0%
look i the rules right now allow
uh

02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
an employee to amend any time up until
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
freely avail of of that right um because
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
i fight very vigorously for my employees
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i recognize that that bogs down the
 
02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:35.109 align:start position:0%
but i recognize that that bogs down the
commission

02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
what i think would be great is if we
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
preserve the right of the employee to
 
02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:41.910 align:start position:0%
preserve the right of the employee to
remove

02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
remove
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
up until the time of the probable cause
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
finding right
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we limit the ability to amend
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
because let's say i'm an employee
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
who didn't file a great complaint right
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and now i want to amend but my my
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
time my deadline for amendment is passed
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
under the new commission rule i i'm not
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
out of luck entirely i still have the
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
ability to go to court
 
02:16:09.679 --> 02:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
ability to go to court
right

02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
um which is you know just
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
desserts for my failure to maybe file a
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
perfect complaint
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know if that's the best
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
way to put it but it's it doesn't
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
completely bar somebody from relief and
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
it would make it would keep an expedited
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
um open accessible process for most
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
folks at the commission and in courts
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
actually have an amendment deadline
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
um as the federal court has
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
has an amendment deadline
 
02:16:39.599 --> 02:16:40.469 align:start position:0%
has an amendment deadline
um

02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
in its in a spoiler plate
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
scheduling order for all civil cases
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and after that you have to show just
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
cause good cause for your amendment and
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
you might not win
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
right um
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that this to to limit amendments
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
um inconsistent with our jurisprudence
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
in courts
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
um and further if we still have the the
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
ability to remove to court
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
then we still haven't have a forum for
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
relief if we can't amend the commission
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
so director malachi you had your hand up
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
for that yeah just very quickly to um to
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
add to what attorney douglas stated you
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
know there is a little box on our form
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
that says ongoing
 
02:17:24.559 --> 02:17:25.509 align:start position:0%
that says ongoing
action

02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
so if this is happening right now or it
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
was happening a few months ago and then
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
i've decided to file a charge i can put
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that something is ongoing which means
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
that um and the attorneys understand
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
this as well which means that you don't
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to file amendments
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
because we will look at the things that
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
are included in that so maybe
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
once you filed your charge you didn't
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
have an issue of retaliation but
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
now it's a month later and you know uh
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
they have taken the information to their
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
attorney now you're receiving
 
02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.629 align:start position:0%
attorney now you're receiving
retaliation

02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
retaliation
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
so technically you could you could amend
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
your charge for retaliation but we could
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
look at all of that
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
as a part of the whole because you have
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
filed your charge with us so we could
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
potentially look so something like that
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
we could potentially look at
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
including it
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
including it in in the investigation as
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward but the point is
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little box that says ongoing
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
action which gives that person a bit
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
more of an umbrella if they're not able
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
to necessarily amend a charge if that's
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
a decision you make
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
well i think i mean i think obviously
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of talk today there's a
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
lot to digest
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
02:18:40.719 --> 02:18:41.589 align:start position:0%
but i think
that

02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know if we're not going to get
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
resources from the ag's office and
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
you're level loaded then we're going to
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
look at something to kind of find a way
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
to to break that backlog up
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
02:18:56.639 --> 02:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
and so i think
um

02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
we should talk about we want to get
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
together again but i think when we do
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
get together again if the committee
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
agrees i think just to kind of summarize
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
where we're at right now um it's and i
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
just everybody give me feedback is
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
we're thinking that the original
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
language in 296 is okay
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
we think that if we take away um
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the the right of removal
 
02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:22.709 align:start position:0%
the the right of removal
that

02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
that extra amount that goes on to the
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
commission can be absorbed so that part
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
we're okay with we did follow back on
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
amending the 180 days in 354
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
just maybe consider for those with an
 
02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:39.270 align:start position:0%
just maybe consider for those with an
attorney

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it comes down to
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
the process itself
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
is how we realigned with the statutory
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
definition of probable cause are we
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
what has been the impact from a time
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
perspective of that realignment
 
02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
perspective of that realignment
and

02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:02.550 align:start position:0%
and
if

02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen the shift then that may
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
help us kind of break up the log jam but
 
02:20:09.439 --> 02:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
help us kind of break up the log jam but
also

02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're maybe open to some things within
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
the process such as looking at the the
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
ability to amend now do you find
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
that those cases that are at the upper
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.359 --> 02:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily those that are pending
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
but um but the ones that have a long
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
investigation time so yes and those are
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
usually our attorney filed ones okay and
 
02:20:36.399 --> 02:20:37.270 align:start position:0%
usually our attorney filed ones okay and
so

02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so i think you know we look to
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
get together i think we're okay on the
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
front end of 296. we want to get back to
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
looking a little bit at the process i
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
from taking the temperature of the
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee where we're at
 
02:20:52.399 --> 02:20:53.349 align:start position:0%
committee where we're at
so

02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm like
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
really busy the next two weeks i do have
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
off next tuesday morning
 
02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:02.309 align:start position:0%
off next tuesday morning
um

02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
because i have actually i'm on another
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
commission in the afternoon
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i have tuesday morning free mondays
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
free but i don't think anybody wants to
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
meet on monday so i have uh i have
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
tuesday morning free and i have all of
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
wednesday the following week
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
do either of those times work for
 
02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:23.110 align:start position:0%
do either of those times work for
anybody

02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
somebody say yes
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the 28th
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
would that work for you
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
 
02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
september

02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
september
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's a wednesday
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
wednesday right
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
no 28th of september
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is today's the 14th
 
02:21:55.520 --> 02:22:00.630 align:start position:0%
this is today's the 14th
okay

02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
so could we go could we go same time on
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay and then hopefully we can flush it
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
out enough
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
that we'll have a you know a good
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
direction out of that because
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative gordon is the chairman of
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole when do we have
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
first

02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
week

02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:22:35.359 --> 02:22:39.670 align:start position:0%
week
okay

02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll really get into the meat
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
and potatoes on the 28th then and then
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
get together kind of the final product
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know what can we do what can we not
 
02:22:52.319 --> 02:22:53.190 align:start position:0%
you know what can we do what can we not
do

02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:22:53.200 --> 02:23:16.630 align:start position:0%
do
um

02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
well if she can i mean it's not easy to
 
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
get at
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
but but director malachi you said you're
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to try to go back
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
like i said the key thing is the
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
break-in date and the the investigation
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
durations before and after the break-in
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
date i mean that would be great data um
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then we can we can look at that we
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
can assess did have an impact that not
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into some other
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
things with respect to the internals of
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
and like i said but we're like i said if
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
if representative gordon is looking to
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
get us together in the second week of
 
02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
get us together in the second week of
october

02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
october
 
02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:17.110 align:start position:0%
october
um

02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
next beginning next meeting will be
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
pretty beefy and hopefully you know
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
we'll come out of it with
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
whatever we have yes
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
a quick question um
 
02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
a quick question um
i

02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
i made a spreadsheet
 
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
that runs from
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
2009 up into 2017 which was the
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
information that was that's on the um
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
hrc website and it and i did an analysis
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
of like cases
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
charges filed cases closed and then any
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
carry over
 
02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
carry over
um

02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
so and i noticed that
 
02:24:50.319 --> 02:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
so and i noticed that
in

02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
a few years
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
there were
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
more cases closed than there were filed
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
for instance in 2013 there were 225
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
cases filed and 283 cases closed
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that made a um
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
closed more than what came in okay so
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's also like a 58 yeah um so
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful to find out what
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
happened in that year and why
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
we can see that was before our time so
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure um but we can see
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
what we can find out for twenty so what
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
would you say okay so i have 2016
 
02:25:45.439 --> 02:25:47.349 align:start position:0%
would you say okay so i have 2016
189

02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
189
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
charges filed
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh 235 closed there was um 46
 
02:25:54.399 --> 02:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
uh 235 closed there was um 46
cases

02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah because you're going to be pulling
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to be pulling things from
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
things that are waiting at this point
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
right so we're looking at a decade of
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
that process and so you're pulling from
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
those so you could potentially
 
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
for right now anyway always have you
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
know for the next few years anyway or
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
next year have more cases closed than
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
cases taken in because you're reaching
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
to get the ones that are waiting and get
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
those closed
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
i did have a question before we finish
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
um there was i i had a question and
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
maybe marissa and attorney douglas can
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
answer and maybe we're not using the
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
memorandum at this point but i did have
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
a question to um because it's maybe
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
something to discuss at the next
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
meeting the penalty mechanism i was um
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
i wanted to find out what the penalty
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
was and what the mech what the thoughts
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
were about that and and the mechanism of
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
applying um assessing a penalty who that
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
well i mean i think we've learned with
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
certain other statutes that um
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know there they don't have teeth if
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's no
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce them
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we've had a a section of 354a that
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
mandates two years um beginning to end
 
02:28:15.439 --> 02:28:16.469 align:start position:0%
mandates two years um beginning to end
um

02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the commission and that's not
 
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.270 align:start position:0%
at the commission and that's not
happening

02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
um and there's no and there's no
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
commensurate enforcement provision and
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we were thinking maybe
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
something should be included in the
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
statute to
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
hold the commission accountable
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
for the deadline
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
i i i personally i you know i i it's
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's nothing personal um it really isn't
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
i i just
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
you know rules rules are only as good
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
i mean how many people are gonna stop at
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
a stop sign if you're not gonna get a
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
ticket i mean i i don't sounds like my
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
argument when we talk about immunity uh
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i uh i don't really have
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
great ideas
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
yet about what that enforcement
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not specifically
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
but it's not inconsistent with the idea
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
of providing justice and that for
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
example in criminal cases
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have speedy trial rules that
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
basically say you need to have your
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
trial within a reasonable period of time
 
02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:33.670 align:start position:0%
trial within a reasonable period of time
because

02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's just not just and
 
02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's just not just and
therefore

02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
cases will be dismissed
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
if they're not heard and
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
so it's not inconsistent i think with
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
justice should be administered in a
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
if i'm a representative and that's a
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
great question director malachi if i
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
were in your shoes i would absolutely
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
want details about
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
what is a penalty what's the enforcement
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism all of that so if it's okay um
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'll try to get together with our folks
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
and touch base with you before the next
 
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
meeting um just to share some of those
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
ideas off the top of my head i know in
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
the civil context is such a thing as a
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
post-judgment interest
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
if settlement negotiations between two
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
parties fail and obviously this is a
 
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
very different concept um there is an
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
interest on the award if you know
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
someone was acting in bad faith so
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's just something off the top of my
 
02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:36.150 align:start position:0%
that's just something off the top of my
head

02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes i mean if it's a financial penalty
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
or the staff paying this or well like
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
what what does that what does that look
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.640 --> 02:31:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
quickly

02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh so mr chairman i would like to say
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
just one thing on in terms of that right
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.510 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
sends out an enormous number of
 
02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:22.469 align:start position:0%
sends out an enormous number of
notifications

02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
notifications
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
to their um
 
02:31:24.319 --> 02:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
to their um
clientele

02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
and every one of them says if you have
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
not respond you do not respond to this
 
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.790 align:start position:0%
not respond you do not respond to this
within

02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
10 days or two weeks
 
02:31:35.439 --> 02:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
10 days or two weeks
or

02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
by tomorrow
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
but they all have a very tight window
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
of response
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it's my thinking
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
that this is a thing that would expedite
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
the investigation process at the
 
02:31:52.319 --> 02:31:53.429 align:start position:0%
the investigation process at the
commission

02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
quite substantially
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
if if if they're going to the employer
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
will say
 
02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
and they will say the employee has said
 
02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:03.110 align:start position:0%
and they will say the employee has said
this

02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
and you have to respond by
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
next tuesday
 
02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:09.590 align:start position:0%
next tuesday
or

02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
discontinue your benefits
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the fda says
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's what they always said
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
and why can't why can't the hrc do the
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
same thing and it works on the other
 
02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:27.429 align:start position:0%
same thing and it works on the other
side

02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
right you could you've said this they
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
said that you got to respond and if you
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't respond by next wednesday
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
or you know then
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're just assuming that there's no
 
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
rebuttal and we're going to use that we
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
do that now
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
so if if the complainant says all of
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
these things happen to me
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
and it's enough for us to dock at the
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
charge and we send notice to the
 
02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
charge and we send notice to the
respondent

02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
respondent
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
the respondent has an opportunity to
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
respond but according to the statute if
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
they choose not to respond at all that
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
is their right
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
however what we will do is we send
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
notification you're not responding we
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
will then deem everything admitted
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then it's a probable cause finding
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing to rebut that so
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's up to the respondent if they choose
 
02:33:18.309 --> 02:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
to respond that's that's up to them it
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's in their best interest too because
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
maybe there's nothing there maybe
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
i i think that's great
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
i haven't experienced that and as a
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i therefore there are
 
02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys in my office
 
02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:38.230 align:start position:0%
attorneys in my office
who

02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:39.270 align:start position:0%
who
have

02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
not received information from
 
02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
not received information from
respondents

02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
respondents
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
and and i think have have inquired with
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
investigators you know where is this
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
information from the respondent that was
 
02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:49.990 align:start position:0%
information from the respondent that was
due

02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
due
 
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
and no consequence has been levied i
 
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
mean i don't know if this isn't is it
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
this is a um a ruled a procedure change
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
of of you know recently but
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
my colleague has told me that he's he's
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
had issues
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
getting things from the respondent and
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
he's sought uh relief from the
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
investigator and he hasn't hasn't gotten
 
02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
investigator and he hasn't hasn't gotten
relief

02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
um i would need i would want to look
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
into that specific instance to make sure
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
that i speak to it appropriately but the
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
rule is what we've been using so they
 
02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to respond is that a
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
formalized rule director malachide you
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me i apologize it's in the rules
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to make one more comment if
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
i could and that was and basically going
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
back to where i think
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith began at the
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
beginning and that is i've been very
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
critical of
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
the of the commission today and and
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i in my mind deservedly so but
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
not critical at all of the staff and i
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
direct him out like i just indicate that
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't really have a problem with the
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
staff but i certainly have a problem
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
with the process and i have a problem
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
with the state for allowing it to
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
continue the way it is so
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we are adjourned until
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
september 28th
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
