00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 align:start position:0%
thank you to um the finance folks for
 
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
allowing us to use their room uh one
 
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
thing of note there is no heat coming
 
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
registers uh pipe has broken and we
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
doubt there will be much heat in this
 
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
building today um as we've experienced
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the last several days we have an old
 
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
old system and it's uh needing enough of
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
a total over overhaul according to Doug
 
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
downstairs so um with that I'd like to
 
00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
get into and utilize our time before our
 
00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
hands freeze up on us here um there's
 
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
been I just uh oh there was also another
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
you I don't know where that is we'll get
 
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.030 align:start position:0%
you I don't know where that is we'll get
it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
later

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
um sheets which I'm passed out you
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
should have there's a sheet that is the
 
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
old formula which we used in 2008 2017
 
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
with some updated information on
 
00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
it there is a sheet which deals on the
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
top it says to from Jennifer Ford to
 
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
myself it has information regarding
 
00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 align:start position:0%
teacher minimum salary teacher average
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
salary um um and uh principal salary by
 
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
school and lastly there was a sheet
 
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
which I got um I asked uh Rebecca uh fet
 
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
put together she's the director of
 
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
special education services over at uh
 
00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
doe so it's a sheet with a little table
 
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
on the top
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
which reflects you know the weighted
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
value of special education in accordance
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
with the bill which we had last
 
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
with the bill which we had last
year

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
and I had another sheet and I don't know
 
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
where I put it or where it is but if not
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
we can get a copy made again um this
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
sheet is the requirement of the federal

need to make some copies that if we
 
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
need to make some copies that if we
could

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
please unless I left to
 
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.230 align:start position:0%
please unless I left to
somewhere

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks just a just a quick question
 
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
on the um the spreadsheet that M fet
 
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.950 align:start position:0%
on the um the spreadsheet that M fet
prepared

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
MH it's got the child count it's got the
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
proposed funding which it was from the
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
bill we looked at last year right yes no
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
I I
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
just um those it's it's based on
 
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
just um those it's it's based on
1022

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
1022
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
count other words I'm talking about the
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
proposed funding per pupil th were those
 
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
the um the differentiated factors some
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
of those some of those values have
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
changed slightly here in accordance with
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
another sheet which we have so I we'll
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get in talk about this it's on the
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
all these are on the docket for a
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
discussion today um great thank you what
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
we got to do is that we have these four
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
bills in front of us uh one deals
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
strictly with swep the other one is the
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
foundation bill that you have and then
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
we have the two bills dealing with base
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
cost and the special education cost and
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
so we really really need to get into a
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
discussion as as a group right here
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
about those bills uh and and and deal
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
with them you know although two of them
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
are wrapped into the foundation
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
formula uh the
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
swep is is is an issue unto itself I
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
believe but uh so what I'd like to do
 
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
today when uh we we get back uh when um
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
Tracy gets back with that sheet these
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
copy I'd like to first get into the bill
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
which is dealing with the
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
$27,000 for a special education that
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
that one I think it's the last one that
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
was on the dock let's see yes is the
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
last one it's
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
very

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
okay nose would go
 
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.309 align:start position:0%
okay nose would go
around

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay so the first bill which we're going
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
to deal with is the one that's on there
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
last at
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
1656 that's increasing the adequacy
 
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
grant for pupils receiving special
 
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
grant for pupils receiving special
education

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
services and I think we all are familiar
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
with that um the it's simply raising the
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
additional uh area within the
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which we are
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
presently at $2,100 to
 
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
$27,000 per pupil um so what I
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
provided um is that there's a number of
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
sheets which uh I provided but there's
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
one dealing with Rebecca uh fet which is
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
the director and the sheet dealing with
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
Act idea Part B indicator
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
five when we're looking at and
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
addressing the the students in these
 
00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.189 align:start position:0%
addressing the the students in these
categorical

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
categorical
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
areas just as a brief rundown we have
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
the 13 IEPs and we know that delivering
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
these Services uh are some of those IEPs
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
are much more expensive than another one
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
where students receiving a shorter
 
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039 align:start position:0%
period of time the form that you see
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
from the data fact sheet which is what
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
we report in indicator 5 a b and c is uh
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
in accordance with a requirement that
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
the department has to collect this
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
information so we can break down the
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
IEPs by service time the amount of time
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
which they're engaged in receiving
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
Direct Services from special education
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
or indirect Services as well and what
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
Rebecca's done is she's breaking broken
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
it down into um a and there's two
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
categories within B which come together
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
the first one a is inside riger class
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
80% or more of the school day that's for
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through age 21 so they're
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
in the classroom the regular classroom
 
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
for 80% of the time the other 20% they
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
may be outside the classroom for
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
support in category B it's inside riger
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
class less than 40% of the day and
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
inside riger class 40% through 79% of
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
the day so those two were category put
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
together and so those would be students
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
which are uh receiving um a riger class
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
less than 40% inside riger class for um
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
the first one is when they're getting
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
only 20% this would be for everything
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
less than that and the third category C
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
is for those that are in hospital bound
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
residential facility separate School
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility we're talking
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
about special education Aid and and CAD
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
a so what is being I asked um Rebecca to
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
give us this information based upon a
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
weighted Factor now this was in the
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
commission study as well and the
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
weighted Factor within the commission
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
study was
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
$27,000 per kid so 27,000 went to every
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
student who has an IEP regardless
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're receiving a half hour
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
instruction two times a week or they're
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
receiving five hours per
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
day per week in in which is much more
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
costly and some IEPs we know res require
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
certain services that are um contracted
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
services and very expensive and
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
Equipment as well and and and
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
specialized facilities within the
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
building even modifying
 
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.030 align:start position:0%
building even modifying
things

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.590 align:start position:0%
things
so

00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm presenting is I want I'd like
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
to put this out for discussion here is
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
that I do not know based upon that and
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is one of the reasons why the vote
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the commission study was 16 to one
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
and I was the one I did not I did not
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
support the idea of funding the same
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
amount of money of 27 grand for every
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
student and and I'll talk the foundation
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
you can speak to that too but we that's
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
based off of and of course I'm an input
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
oriented person I want to know what
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
those elements are that are contributing
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
to base
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy that formula looked at the
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
opposite end and no matter how you you
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
you you move things around internally
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
you had to come up with that particular
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
pupil cost at the end or support that
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
pupil cost so if you had a weighted
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
version of in the formula which is 4.29
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
times the base and you change that to up
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
or down something else is going to have
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
to change as well within to get to that
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
final product and cost Factor so I I
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
would I I prefer myself to see us
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
support differentiated Aid in accordance
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
with the criteria that we have for the
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
categories and the criteria that we have
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
we tried IEPs before breaking the 13
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
IEPs down into separate categories but
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
kids cross over from one to the other
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
you have multiple handicaps and that's
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
not the way to do it and and after
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
contacting the department they have this
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
information in accordance with what the
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
federal requires so I'm advocating that
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the formula that we propose be one if
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to make any changes to the
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
formula at all be reflective of a
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
weighted formula now just one other B
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
bit of information for you before we
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
charge off into the discussion there is
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
a sheet which we got from the education
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
Commission the states I had Jennifer 4
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
research the number of states which have
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
a weighted formula you can see it right
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
up top that you know it says the filter
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
for this on on the first page was
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
special education funding mechanism
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
multiple weights so they're filtering it
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
out to multiple weights and you can see
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
through there that there's a number of
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
states which do have this built into
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
their adequacy formula so we're going
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
down a path that we would be going down
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
a path that is is is well accepted
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and there's
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
others I have another sheet which I'm
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
not going to put that out in front of
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
you right now where there's hybrids to
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
this formula everybody is doing
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
something a little bit differ and how to
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
address this so what I'd like to do is
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
open this up to our discussion right now
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
and find out where people are in terms
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
of this this uh this
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill um and how it may impact um our
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
costing r ucation so it's open for a
 
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.670 align:start position:0%
costing r ucation so it's open for a
discussion

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
1656 any feedback yes representative
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
casc cascaden she had her hand up to
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
ladies first sorry didn't see that sorry
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
no that's all right um maybe it's the
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
same question I don't know so 4.29 was
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
what we came up in the formula as the
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
weighted amount times the base comes out
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
to 27,000 So based on what you're saying
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that that weight be
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
different for
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
an a a b or c category depending on how
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
much that service is yes yes okay yes
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
yes I am and and the
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
4.29 is what is it a c is it a b is it
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
an a 4.29 I don't remember is a weight
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's been given to all those
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
categories within that formula you're
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
talking about yeah and I'm I'm
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting that and I'm not necessarily
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
saying I'm support I'm not NE I'm not
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
supporting 4 .29 I think that's too high
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
I'm the question I'm asking right now
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
should we develop
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
categories for for costing them out and
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
should that be reflective of the cost of
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
the base cost which is a result of
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
inputs y for what we see as an adequate
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
education so just it seems then it would
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
make sense for .29 to be highest or most
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
expensive Services right is that the
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
homebound or the out of District or the
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
the one that requires a higher level and
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't necess pay for all
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
the the the catastrophic Aid either it's
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
just what through what we're providing
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
for that student and the amount I
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
believe that comes out to not 4.29 if
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
you look at the highest category there
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's 1.29 of the base where are you
 
00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
it's 1.29 of the base where are you
looking

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's the calculation I have here oh
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and in in uh the the other
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
where we now are
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
funding education around what $2,300
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
roughly right uh yeah y yep for per
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
pupil and that is a percentage of the
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
base right now so the percentage you're
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
seeing there is going to be roughly
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
around 043 of the
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
base and the other category in the
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
middle would be about 0.9 s and this
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and the total cost for that
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
for the state the difference between
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
what funding right now differentiated
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
would be a little over 12 million2
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
million that's on the sheet that you
 
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.949 align:start position:0%
million that's on the sheet that you
have

00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
there representative luno you have a
 
00:16:58.829 --> 00:16:58.839 align:start position:0%
question um yeah do um so the the 4.29
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
weight that we have in um in House Bill
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
1586 was calculated based on um on
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
actual costs that districts have that
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
are attributable to special education so
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a madeup number it's not a what
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
can we afford or anything like that it's
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
what districts are currently spending
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
that is attributable to special
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
education costs and it includes all the
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
category the three categories that
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I I agree it's a
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's a Blended a blended number all
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
special education cost
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and I and I absolutely agree with you
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that I think if we can get data
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Ed that we were
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
not able to get during the um during the
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
commission's work that breaks down costs
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
by category actual District costs
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
attributable special education by
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
category then then we can provide some
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
some um some better definition to th to
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
those differentiated Aid factors so I
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with you um on that so
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is um and this isn't on
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
the sheet I believe is what do we know
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be the district
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
costs attributable to special education
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
for each of these categories not not
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
just a a um proposed funding per pupil
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
because 1586 again separates costing
 
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.149 align:start position:0%
because 1586 again separates costing
from

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
funding and and so starting with cost
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
what what what has the department been
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
able to provide for district costs of
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
special education attributable to each
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
categories okay are there you know I I
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at we're basing it I'm
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the formula we have in place
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
right now and and when you look at that
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
formula that's how differentiate Aid was
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
developed off of the Bas the inputs and
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
what the cost of a teacher is what the
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
cost you know overall for um all those
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
categories what you see on the other
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
sheet that I passed out to you this one
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and on that sheet right there
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
notice that the the amount of money
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
sheet um is for
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
$2,560 that is a Formula which been
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
derived based upon first year teachers
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
that are currently on the books right
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
now that's the average versus the the
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
original cost which was
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
$3,456 I believe but that was calculated
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
much the same way as this just this is
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is using the exact same formula
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
only plugging in and you can see if you
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
look at the bottom line on the back page
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
as you give the file that notice also on
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
this sheet right here the teacher K
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
through2 teacher has been reduced from
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
25 to1 to 20 to1 and the 3 through 12 is
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
reduced from 30 to1 to 1 to 25 but the
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line is it's
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
$485 as the univers veral cost of Base
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
cost okay so that's the figure we're
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
we're working off of to get to special
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
education right but how do we get to to
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
knowing what multiple or what weight off
 
00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.470 align:start position:0%
knowing what multiple or what weight off
that

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
4852 would be if we don't know what the
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
districts are act what their what the
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
district costs are for each of those
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
categories um you know the the the the
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
department has been able to give you the
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
the student count for each one they
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
probably have the
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
costs for
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
um for you know you know for those
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
categories of special education specific
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
special costs attributable to those
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
categories um of special education and
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I I I mean would doesn't that make
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
sense to have what what are you know
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
what what are the costs and then we can
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
come up with the
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
weights there is a bill that's in the
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
house right
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
now working towards forming a commission
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
to dig into exist what you're saying and
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
that you're the prime sponsor of that
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
rep we get that on Thursday and we're
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
talking about a topic here which is yes
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
you know the federal commitment they're
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
not doing what they said they initially
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
do it's what 40% they said they they're
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
cutting that down to 19% slow roughly
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
and so we're not receiving so what the
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
districts are going to have are having
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
to do through their property taxes
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
they're having to make that difference
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
up oh believe me I know that I mean we
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
all know that and and so the costing of
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
special education that's taken a huge
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
chunk of our operating monies for educ
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm asking Mr chair is
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
can we request the department to provide
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
the the the co the special education
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
costs attributable to each of the three
 
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.990 align:start position:0%
costs attributable to each of the three
categories

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide um you know that that
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
districts are spending now and would
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't that help um not only
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee but also the of any
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
future study
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
committee represent can I add to that
 
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
request that the department um Define
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
the manner in which they'll collect that
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
data I think it's important that um we
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
start thinking now about a mechanism
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
because I think this is going to be a
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
have to do at some point um a mechanism
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
we know that um I don't know if they
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
call it i4c anymore whatever they call
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
it the student count yeah um is that
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to be the methodology and through
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
that process will that give us that
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
really accurate information that we're
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
looking for um so I just would like to
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
kind of know how do they think they
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
obtain that knowledge I I think to see
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
the actual cost the actual is very
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
worthy task okay um and necessary and
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
necessary as a sub committee though we
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
only have a week and a half two weeks to
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
get this thing done so I I think what we
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
need to do is that if we're all an
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
agreement that working towards a
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
differenti a component which is based on
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
categorical needs of these categories
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the only way I know of doing it is
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with that this this
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
requirement right here rather than
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
trying to find out by IEP I don't think
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
they have that information now they have
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
this information so what is the actual
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
cost for for these students get from doe
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
that so so it's it's got to be somewhere
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
I know but uh that that's that's
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
contributing to the increase in our cost
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
for Education
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
totally so when it comes to this
 
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.230 align:start position:0%
totally so when it comes to this
particular

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
Bill how's how's this committee feeling
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
about waiting it all at
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
$27,000 that's what we're going to have
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
to make a decision up or down in that or
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
inter room study it or where are we
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
going I'm asking the question to the
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
commit M yep Mr chair the
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
$27,000 seems to be a number that is
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
attributable to special education
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
Blended across all
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
categories Mike my question you how'd
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
you come up with 4.29 four 4.29 was was
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
was was the total four 4.29 was done
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
through the air um uh report and they
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
looked at 10 years worth of doe 25 data
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
were able to pull out the costs that are
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
specific to special education divided
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
that up by the number of students and
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
came to a waiting factor of 4.29 off the
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
base of $6,500 but it's also related to
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
your end cost for a p puple cost in
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
education right but and it and it came
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
out to the 4.29 is roughly
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
$28,000 so so if another component
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
within this costing formula were to
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
change and go up would this have to come
 
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.029 align:start position:0%
change and go up would this have to come
down

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
um the so you you've got three
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
categories that you're proposing what I
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
and I'll just well in this but there's
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
other weighted components within form
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
right but you've got a low and a medium
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
and a high the high would be higher than
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
27,000 far fewer students
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
right the high would be higher the
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
medium would probably be a little bit
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
higher than than the the 27 and the low
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
would probably be less than the 27 if
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
costs on a per pupil basis for for the
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
students that are identified Statewide
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
categories I'm listening to you yeah I
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
mean that I'm I'm agreeing with with
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
your approach um Mr chair I think we
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
need to have get some actual cost
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
from the Department yeah I don't believe
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have those actual costs
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
by February
 
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
15th I agree so then we're gonna have to
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
where because that is a component within
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
several of the bills yeah so you
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
know represent
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
Ames I just want to say that I
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with doing this getting
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
those cost the 27,000 broken out into
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
these three categories and I think the
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
implication for this bill is that
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh if we think there's a kernel of
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
validity to it that it's it's got to be
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
put off into inter
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
study repr dry thank you yeah I agree
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a shotgun approach right
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
now and if we have the ability to Target
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
it better I think we should take
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
advantage of it and it may take time I
 
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.669 align:start position:0%
advantage of it and it may take time I
agree

00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to speak on a very
 
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.870 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to speak on a very
conceptual

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
conceptual
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
level um because I have no idea how the
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
$27,000 was derived let alone how it
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
would break out into three categories if
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
recalculated but averages are very
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous especially if you have a broad
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
dispersion um and the fet chart reveals
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
very evidently what we pretty much
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
already know and that is that when you
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
break out into these three
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
categories there is no convergence in
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
the student count it's 22,000 Plus in
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
one category
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
2,000 uh nearly 4,000 in the
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
others so to try and average things that
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
are so widely
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
disparate um is a bad idea to begin with
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
and then the other
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
variable which is the uh the average
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
cost these
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
categories has the same problem so
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
mathematically you compound the problem
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
you if you come to a single
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
average that is derived from two
 
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
variables that each are actually very
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
disparate across the data
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
set which is to say I think the more you
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
break it out the more you differentiate
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
the better and so I think the three G
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
category approach is a good one yes
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
where we go in terms of getting the
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
numbers is well represent we're going to
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
have to get from doe and they're going
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
to have to get it out of the districts
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but we do have trends for a special
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
education in terms of uh the IE specific
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
IEPs going way back when I first arrived
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
that information was available you were
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner at that time or a
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier than that but um the
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
trends are there and the number of
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
students for example in that last C the
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
more expensive category has been roughly
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
in the same ballpark um 600 700 students
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the total number of IEPs has not
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
really changed significantly it's
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
grown as we have our demographic going
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
down special ed IEP C population is
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
increasing and um but that is just
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
my quick look but I'm also seeing right
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
here a that's all the more reason to go
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
into into breaking out the categories
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
and and here they're using
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
28626 students for this it's it's been
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
higher than that and it's been up to 30
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
31,000 so we got to be consistent and so
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be some
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
averages built in somewhere but
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
averaging it by these categories I think
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's much more efficient and effective
 
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.830 align:start position:0%
it's much more efficient and effective
represent

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
Heath my mind um I know that U the
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
school fear fing has done an analysis of
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
Special Ed I don't know if it's okay to
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
ask Zach if he has any contributions to
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
this Con
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
conversation well if there are any
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets or any information that
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
people can give us I'd be very
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
interested in receiving that um uh
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
however and they're if they have
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
something they're willing to put their
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
hand up and we'll you know find out I
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
think what we will try to do is work
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the department and they often times
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
work with other groups as well and
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
gather gathering this information they
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
do okay
 
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.509 align:start position:0%
do okay
so

00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
yes it seems to me uh if this
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
available then you could build an
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
algorithm as part of the
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
bill and have the algorithm in the bill
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
but not the dollars and so if the
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
information can be had over time and
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
there something comes out the other side
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
based on the algorithm I think we're
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
even though I can't vote I think we're
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
agreeing it's better to have these three
 
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.789 align:start position:0%
agreeing it's better to have these three
categories

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
that's yes I agree I agree with that and
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think once if we broke out the
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
categories and decided what they were
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
because it's the goal is least
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment as you you see
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
in the data sheet right the the federal
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
indicators are already identified of 80%
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
40% and the last one so at least you
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
start with those three because you can
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
tie it to the indicators on Ida and then
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
like representative just said don't have
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount because it's going to
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
vary so much and then plug into a
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
formula each individual District cost
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
right you can see on the education
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
commission uh education Commission of
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
the states there that the information I
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
gave you there there there's several
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
states which have multiple multiple um I
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
categories for funding
 
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.950 align:start position:0%
categories for funding
IEPs

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
IEPs
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
um I would think that to get that
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
information would be very very diff to
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
try to break it down that microscopic
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
may be very difficult given the nature
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the support we have At Doe and the
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
support that many of these small school
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
districts have which they don't
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
have um in a lot of these towns so this
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
sheet rate using these categorical
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
numbers categories that we know we have
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
to respond to these are being done and I
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
think that would expedite our whole
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
process and I think we would achieve if
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
we could have these three type of
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
categories we tried it the other way and
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
I had numerous special directors
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
contacting me saying this I and this IP
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
they're meshing together kids are have
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
both categories and you see this
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
movement on you you have students that
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
are are orthopedically handicapped or
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
physically handicap but also have a
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
disability and and or or or you know
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
maybe a traumatic brain injury and
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
so I think we better stick with what the
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
feds are asking us for yes um thank you
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would um I just want to tag
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
on to what representative Ames was was
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting that uh that we we look at
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
interim study for 1656 so that we can
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
work on identify I think um
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative dry suggested this too
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
that this is going to take some time to
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
um to to you know understand and and and
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
put some uh put some numbers behind uh
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
behind this I was also wondering if um
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
if and I know it may be outside of the
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
specific scope of of this subcommittee
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
but if the subcommittee could also make
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
an advisory opinion on representative
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
Heath's Bill to actually study the um uh
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
the work because I think I think
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
supporting an interim study on this and
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
supporter supporting an OTP to actually
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
studying it are are very
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
consistent any comments on that has
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
everybody had an opportunity to read
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
that bill that you have there's one
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
angle in there you're also reflecting on
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
that we have to raise more
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
money and that equates to me property
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
taxes or income tax or sales
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
tax that's not the intent I can say
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
right right now out of the gate I will
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
not support income tax or sales tax and
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
I I that was in my report that Minority
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
Report that I put into the commission
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
study I think that's just going to be a
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
war on the house
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
floor yes yeah I I absolutely agree with
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
with with your comments um Mr chair and
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
and believe firmly believe if we're
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
going to do anything to try to address
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
school funding that we make addressing
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
school funding the um um the
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
the the the goal and not a not not
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
preced it with a tax debate and if we
 
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
can do so in a way that provides Equity
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
equity for students and taxpayers uh
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
without requiring getting into a tax
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
debate then I think we will have made
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
huge progress on this goal the purpose
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
of this committee we're dealing with
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
policy but we also have ways
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
Finance here with us and I think it's
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
important that we come forth with the
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
policy get that affirmed or supported
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
and then we figure out okay represent
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
Ames okay represent uh Tracy here figure
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
it out cost wise um thank
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
you okay but but we can't divorce that
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
topic though we can't divorce it that's
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
why we have people here right now with
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
us on this on this committee so
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
everything is sort of melded together
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
but we got to get our policy squared
 
00:36:39.319 --> 00:36:40.430 align:start position:0%
but we got to get our policy squared
away

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
first okay so I think that would take us
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
through that particular bill um is the
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee supportive of interim study
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
and also pending support we get from
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
that commission study as long as that
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
that committee study of yours represent
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
Heath as long as we don't get wrapped up
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
in income tax and sales
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
tax okay good yes further Mr chair for
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
the same reasons I would also suggest an
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
interim study on 1586 since it also has
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
the differentiated um um factors for
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
special education and should be brought
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
out into three categories and there's
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
that in addition to numerous other
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
um considerations that that would need
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be addressed in that bill that that
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
you is that also agreed upon by the
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee here that then that we treat
 
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.270 align:start position:0%
committee here that then that we treat
uh

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
1656 and
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
1586 in the same manner that we would
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
support an interim
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
study yes can you clarify for me um in a
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
room study that just gives a window of
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
time to work out the details and does it
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a time limit or it's open well it
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
gets us right through the fall fall of
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
the Year okay I just try it's if there
 
00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.790 align:start position:0%
the Year okay I just try it's if there
are

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
these areas where we want actual costs
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
if we want algorithm um then I think we
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
properly but I'm also concerned that we
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
are presenting we we need to get on it
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
seeing that we're going to be preparing
 
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
a budget for the next bayum very shortly
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
here and we need to know if we're going
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
to categorize something in
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid whatever the cost
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
might be we'd have to figure that out
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
but we we need I strongly feel that we
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to categorize that differentiated
 
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.309 align:start position:0%
need to categorize that differentiated
Aid

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
area is there any objection from
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
committee members on that point that we
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
Ed I agree yeah I think everybody's in
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
concurrence on that okay good represent
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
Heath did you have your hand up or
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
something no okay
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
good oh okay represent
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
dry to take good notes are we talking
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
about already interim studying
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
1586 yes we were doing both okay and my
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
my comment on that would be um is that
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
just to study the part with the funding
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
for special ed because I feel like there
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
are other well there are other areas
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not done yet here we
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
have two other bills here which we need
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
the the the base cost and we need to
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
talk sweat okay just I'm just want to
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that there are other issues
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
with 1586 don't get pushed away because
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're concentrating on the special all
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
we do is in this committee we're making
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full committee
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
that will be made there understand that
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and if you go back to our task
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
which was put forth by the speaker
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
working with the minority leader we were
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
recommended changes in areas that you
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
know would benefit the children in the
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
state okay let's go on to the next one
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
then and I want to talk about the see we
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
got into one component there let's trip
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
1583 no excuse me yeah that's it yep
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's the base
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
help me out a little bit here the the
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
base cost we know is $4,100 right now um
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's based upon inputs right is is it
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
understood that this $10 million is also
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to be based upon
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
input or is this aligned with the other
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
formula

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you're talking about
 
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you're talking about
um

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
1583 yes correct yes um yeah my
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is is 1583 makes no other
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
changes um with respect to uh looking at
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes or accountability or anything
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
that it's it
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
would rely based on the the current
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
framework for okay okay input based
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
framework so then let's look at the this
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
the sheet right
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
that this is a sheet that was developed
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
originally back in 2008 through Senator
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
esbrook study when we had the costing
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education we also
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
developed what the opportunity for an
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
adequate education is and that was the
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
year I came into legislature so I was
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
really oblivious to what was going on I
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
was just in like a freshman in in high
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
school and a freshman in college um so
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
but the the the price back then was set
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
at at a much lower figure than we have
 
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.230 align:start position:0%
at at a much lower figure than we have
right

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
here and it was based upon all these
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
inputs that you see on the left hand
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
side teachers principal Administrative
 
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
Assistant guidance counselor library
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
media specialist and it goes to the
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
reverse side technology
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
coordinator and custodian and then those
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
other components which are not uh
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
instructional materials technology
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
teacher professional development
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
facilities operation and maintenance
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
transportation and came out with a total
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
cost for K through two and came out with
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
a total cost for grades three through 12
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
and then we came up with a universal
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
cost if it K through two there's three
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
three grade levels there we're talking
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
about that was multiplied times that uh
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
basic total cost 4K through two and then
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
they did the same thing for 3 through 12
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
they took that base cost of what it was
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
and multipli that by the remaining uh 10
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
because it' be grades uh 3 through 12
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
there's 10 there um and that was divided
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
by 13 because the 13 grade levels that
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
we have K through 12 and we came out
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
with the universal cost for base C
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
education so what this does I asked uh
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
the research upstairs to find out what
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
is the cost today for a firste teacher
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
Jennifer you did it yes the doe has
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
teacher okay and you see that memo that
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
was handed out Mr chair yes the the
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
question I have though is that it says
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
if costing is based on a
 
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
208 to7 so are you saying that the cost
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
on this particular
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
sheet is the most recent cost it's not
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
based upon it's not on this is the if
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
you look at this sheet right here the
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
teacher minimum salary State average
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
minimum salary is
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
$425 that's the that's the price the
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
cost of which we're using right here in
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
this formula you look at the Top Line it
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
says 4256
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
Z on this
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
sheet that
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
sheet okay so we are using the current
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
information from doe here and then
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's a benefits package which 33% was
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
taken in account you had the total cost
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
which came out to 56
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
605 I did reduce that from 1 to 25 to 1
 
00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.710 align:start position:0%
605 I did reduce that from 1 to 25 to 1
to

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
20 so that increase the
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
cost of of your bottom figure um but in
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the average per pupil teacher
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
ratio is much lower than 20 to1 I would
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
ballpark that those decisions are often
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
times made by the local school
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
district and looking that I I've met
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
with some superintendent say that they
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a teacher and they have to
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a PA in every
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
classroom I was commenting earlier this
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
morning that when I was a principal and
 
00:45:40.839 --> 00:45:42.390 align:start position:0%
morning that when I was a principal and
later

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
administrator wonderful school over in
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
Rumford Maine West Peru where I had two
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
nuns one in kindergarten one in first
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
grade I could put 28 kids in that
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
classroom and they would all come out
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
learning how to basically spell and read
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
and everything else they were really on
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
top of it so these are local
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
decisions and so when they drop it that
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
low that's a local decision based upon
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
the characteristics of a community
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's poverty they may not have
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
the money or maybe they have some
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
situations where they need that type of
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
ratio um the state has to come up with
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of on an input basis what we
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
figure is the average input cost and so
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
using that salary that's how we came up
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
with it I did reduce it to 1 to 20
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
seeing that's more in common that that's
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
going in the direction that we it's
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
still above the average for the state
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
but it's going in the direction and and
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
dropping the high school also down to
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
one to 30 1 to 25 you can see grades 3
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
through 12 down to 1 to 25 we know that
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
in high school because of block
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
scheduling and all that there's some
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
classes they can load up a little bit
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
more than other classes and it should
 
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
more than other classes and it should
balance

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
out so my concern is is that are we
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
looking to try to recommend something
 
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.910 align:start position:0%
looking to try to recommend something
that

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
is an increase or are we staying with
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
what we currently have on the books of
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
$4,100 per kit this would jump it
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
by to
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
4,852 in just some real quick
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
million if you add in the special
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
education also so it comes up close to
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
115,000 115 million so there's there's a
 
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.069 align:start position:0%
115,000 115 million so there's there's a
jump

00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
there it's open for a discussion I don't
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
want to poog it well yes represent
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
Ames as I think we all know uh
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
this costing
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
question um was the subject of a trial
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh in that trial to several
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
experts the superintendent that conell
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
was one of the principal
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
ones um walked through all these
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
different input cost so it was an input
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
based query that occurred at in the
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
trial and uh and out of that uh all of
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
which is documented in the Court's
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
decision uh came a 7,000 something
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
number uh $
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
7,356 per pup number which is higher
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
than this uh know I I can only talk
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
generally about this but uh but that
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
analysis is here is a different analysis
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
than the one you that was worked through
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
what was it 19 uh
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
200 uh8 I think
 
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh it basically found that it's more
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
costly to run schools than
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
is shown in in that data um I think we
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
have to deal with that not just work
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
back and try to work over and update the
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
analysis that was done 12 years ago
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it was now remember there was a
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
sheet passed out at the last meeting and
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
if we took the all the state
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation dollars which are going to
 
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.990 align:start position:0%
appropriation dollars which are going to
these

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
districts the current law
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
adequacy on average in the state is
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
$682 per
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
pupil that's what it is now that's
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
case representative Miler yeah I think
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
to tag on to representative ames's
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
comment I think it's important because
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
from what I understand in the courts in
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
the court case the state had no
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
justification for the current
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
4100 there was they made no no apparent
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
Appeal on why that figure is
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
good uh the uh defendants the state
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
basically try to
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
nitpick what the input model that was
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
coming forth from conval and so I think
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
as we begin to look at the 4100 moving
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
it to 5100 to 6 th there's got to be a a
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
better basis which what I think the cour
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
was saying is that there's basis for the
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
need to increase that figure and that
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
the current process of what we're doing
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
is really what they were ruling against
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
as it relates to where we are right now
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
in the funding them I don't think
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
they're against
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
input I I I agree with you on that I'm
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
just saying that the current way that
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
the state is funding has no merit was
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
was was not there was no
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
justification on the part of the state
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
appeal that the current way we are
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
funding it 4100 has any basis whatsoever
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm not a lawyer I don't want to get
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
in talking about what's happening in the
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
blinsky case or the conell case and all
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
that we're here today to try to address
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
this side right here
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
and we have not looked at the costing
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
formula that we have on the books dve
 
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.870 align:start position:0%
formula that we have on the books dve
back

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
2008 looked at in 2017
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
2018 in conjunction with are these
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
inputs what we want are these inputs
 
00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:38.990 align:start position:0%
inputs what we want are these inputs
what

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
are uh needed out in the in the schools
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and yes there are a lot of nontan
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
non-tangible things which are going on
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
in schools that are not going to be
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
controlled by
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
money and that's and I mentioned it
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
before the aspiration of the community
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
the the parent involvement the
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
leadership in the building the quality
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
of staff and the staff's teaching and
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
and have the curriculum and instruction
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
aligned with what the state standards
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
are all those types of things and more
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
come into play and those are things
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
which vary from District to district and
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
some District costs are higher and lower
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
than others yes and maybe that's due to
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
the property equal property valuation
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
and it may be also a result of these
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
these variables which I just mentioned
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
and more there's more
 
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.789 align:start position:0%
and more there's more
variables

00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
variables
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
so I I I
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't I I think for example when I asked
 
00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
a question to the conval folks we need
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
two adults in every classroom teacher
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
and a parah that was it I said what
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
happens if it's 10 10 to one we need two
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
well that's the state's not going to
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
support that it can't support that so I
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think what we need to do is really
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at what is going to
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
be our base C this is what we have this
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
is current law and we're dealing with
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
current law right now if the interum
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
study comes out and goes some other
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
course fine but are we going to say we
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
looked at this as a subcommittee and we
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
think it's fine the way it is $4,100
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
does the
 
00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:22.750 align:start position:0%
does the
job

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
representes I guess what I would say is
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
that I think this is an incredibly
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
complicated inquiry we all know that I
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
mean that's saying nothing we all know
 
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
that but it's incredibly complicated and
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
to think that we're going to be able to
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
sort it out in this
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with the two weeks or so
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
left to our to our uh existence uh is is
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
foolish we just can't do that so it it
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
seems to me that uh that this
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
points towards what we've already said
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
about uh what is it
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
1586 um and uh interim study that this
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
this question is really a subset of the
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
questions we were talking about special
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
education and how that might be divvied
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
up in a different way and looked at um
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh 1586 itself has the whole you
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
know whole picture there um why
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be part of that uh
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
instead of dealing with it
 
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
separately I don't want to go with the
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
assumption that that 1586 is going to be
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
what we're working towards um we we look
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
at it I didn't mean to imply that I'm
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah we we want to we're looking
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.069 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
this group will have additional
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
discussion to evaluate the successes and
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
shortcomings of the funding formula for
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grade 12 and
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
propose any changes to improve the
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
funding formula and they may obtain
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
technical support or input as needed
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
that was in this charge that would came
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
out from speaker's office uh
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
so while we're looking at this do we see
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
that there's a need to look at the
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
current formula in terms of how we are
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
coming up with the cost costing amount
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
for base
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
cost represent
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
cascad thank you
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
struggling in hopes that we are not
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
Beering off the work of the commission
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
because it's so technical this work is
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
difficult um and we spent a whole
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
year grasping with trying to summarize
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
everything that we learned in the
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
costing out of an adequate
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
education and in the end the
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations were that we felt
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation should be
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
included and I don't recall at this
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
point um on the school health the school
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
nurse position because it's not listed
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
in here but I don't remember the outcome
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
of that one um but why would we not
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
start with the summary or recommendation
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
commission and move it forward in some
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
fashion because the outcome was not a
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
specific dollar because every single
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
district is different in size different
 
00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:38.630 align:start position:0%
district is different in size different
in

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
expense and if you put in
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
certain you know factors right we had
 
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.589 align:start position:0%
certain you know factors right we had
that

00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
that
conversation

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
um why aren't we moving from that to
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
move the needle
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
versus in can air develop that algorithm
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
that representative AR was kind of
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
playing around
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
with I mean if this committee feels that
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
direction now you're talking to Rick lad
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
I am and Rick lad was the one who voted
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
against the commission report but you
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
said it was because of there's good
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
things within it there good things
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
within it right right but I I I do not
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
comprehend or understand how you came up
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
the figure you're you're deciding this
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
is what we got a fund education at at to
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
maintain or get get to that achievement
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
level we want these kids at what are the
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
inputs for that end item and what are
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
and where did you get this end item
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
based upon what the doe 25 form didn't
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
we identify that the commission was
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
transportation's taken out of that but
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
that Doe 25 form has all your expenses
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
all of expenses are all those expenses
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy right I don't know I don't
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
think they are represent Luna yeah th
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
thanks um Mr chair and that's one of the
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
things that I'd suggest we take a take a
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
look at in interim study on that because
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
um because I I do agree with you that
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
that I think I mean obviously I'm I I I
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
really feel the an outcom driven
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
um definition is strong but I think also
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
having a a hard deck establishing a hard
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
deck as far as the um the um the core
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
components of an adequate
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
education as they exist right now in one
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
1932a having that those things listed I
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
think makes a lot of sense too uh so so
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to push that to an interm
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
study thing but going back to the bill
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
1583 right yeah 1583 um I guess I still
 
00:58:55.319 --> 00:58:56.670 align:start position:0%
1583 right yeah 1583 um I guess I still
don't

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.630 align:start position:0%
don't
understand

00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
where conval differs from from this you
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
know the modified
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
2017 uh chart where you've updated the
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
um the the salary the benefits and the
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
um the teacher to student ratios and I
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
was wondering if maybe um um um U Mr
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
Sheen uh might be able to talk to us
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
about what the Court's actual well we
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
had this sheet which was provided to us
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
by our research upstairs M if you dig
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
down in it you can see the teacher
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
minimum salary in public disc school
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
districts 20232 24 4256 you can look
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
exactly and find out what C conal's
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
minimum salary is where they where
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
they're starting and where are they well
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
you have to look down through here um
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
this has
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
combat Oh you mean actual what the conal
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
district yeah yeah oh I I was more more
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
interested in what the conal court um oh
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
okay I thought you talking about the no
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
no and I mean just to just to understand
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
because representative Ames
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative Myer talked about what
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
the what the what the how the court
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
developed its its
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
7356 uniform cost and I was wondering if
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
Mr uh Sheen might be able to but I'm not
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
interested in in the court no no I'm
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
interested in the legislature doing this
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just trying to understand
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
what the court
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
did with elder respect Mr chair I think
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
we are trying to make informed decisions
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
and everything that we need I think the
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
court essentially is part of the work
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to do and we need to be as
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
informed as much as we can so I kind of
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
agree with u representative luno and I I
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from from Zach in
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
terms of our thinking um in terms of
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
what the base should be we grappled with
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
it in division
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
two representative didn't we um and or
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
grappling grappling absolutely and there
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
were a lot of factors that that we had
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
to consider and that bottom line always
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
kept coming up but I think what happened
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the courts has to influence they're
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
expecting the legislature to to respond
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
somehow so I would vote if I could um to
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
hear what um uh Mr Sheen has to
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
say we've had input from various groups
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
last several meetings we've had I think
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's time for us
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
to if we we've all discussed the idea of
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
inim study and looking through the bill
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
that you have representative Heath yeah
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it's time for this
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee to decide side you know some
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
of these issues without saying well
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to need another darn
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
committee the last commission study we
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
had was a half a million dollar
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
commission and we came out and we have
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
flaws in the report or misunderstandings
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
or people that don't I don't understand
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
all of it in terms of where they came up
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
with that goal the performance
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
outcome and uh based upon what what
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
criteria we are tasked by the statute or
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
by the the court
 
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
by the the court
to

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
identify regardless of poverty or wealth
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
of a district to provide an adequate
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
education fairly to all kids and that
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
means costing it out yeah and and and it
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
has to be done I Believe by inputs and I
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
think this is where we're coming down to
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
it that there's some that believe this
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
performance outcome side
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
without and I think it's going to end up
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to deal with the
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
inputs there too but there's another
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
side in this house that are saying we
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
like the input method because we feel
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're meeting the requirements of the
 
01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.029 align:start position:0%
we're meeting the requirements of the
court

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
cases now whether we're costing it is
 
01:03:06.839 --> 01:03:08.430 align:start position:0%
cases now whether we're costing it is
another

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
issue well you got two hands of rep ases
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then Ways and
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
Means Ways and Means comes before
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
education okay um well um as I said
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
before I think interm study is going to
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
be needed and uh as I also said it's a
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
complex inquiry and U so um before
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
moving on from that thought um interim
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
study has to be a real interim study not
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
just a a way of deferring action on the
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill and then killing it um we need to
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
this is a good good way to look at it
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
we've got people from finance and Ways
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
and Means and education and uh the
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
leaders are the education committee
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
people it's it's got a good structure to
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
it in my opinion um and we need to look
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
at both ways of looking at this as
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
costing this out the outcome based model
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
that leads to certain things and the
 
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
input based approach that uh has led to
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
slightly different numbers or different
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
numbers um we need to go through that
 
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
and if in the end um the committee
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
assigned that function of uh
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
studying uh comes out with a couple of
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
different options so be it that's okay
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature in the end is going to
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
have to look at this thing so that would
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
be maybe in my my view a very good
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
outcome if if um the committee has two
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
ideas about how to solve this problem
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
let's put them on the table and then uh
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
the larger group that's the legislature
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
can try to figure that out
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh in all by all means build on the work
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's been done in the past take into
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
account the court and what it has tried
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
to do in good faith both sides that
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
worked in good faith on this struggling
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
with uh with a very difficult issue this
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
P you know plagued us troubled us for 30
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
years uh let's see what we can do by uh
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
by this
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
approach by just that approach or
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
see I myself not interested in getting
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
involved if it's going to be just going
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
in and doing exactly what happened in
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
the last year where the commission
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
report that's all we were looking at one
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
model we had decided this is the model
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it there's another
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
model which was done in 2008 and again
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
in 20171
 
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.269 align:start position:0%
in 20171
18

01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
so I think if there's going to be
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
something about be looking at the whole
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
issue of costing an adequate
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
education and we ought to be open and
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
path represent Mila thank you I want to
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
just pick up on what represent am said
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's been 30
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
years 30 years since the first clont
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
one since that time we've had four or
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
five cases
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
again and each time the Supreme Court
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
has said to this legislature fix it and
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
each time we've walked away from it
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
we've tinkered with it we've added a
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
little bit here a little bit there but
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
we've never really met the Mandate of
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
the Court this court for the first time
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
put a marker
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
down they put a marker down of
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
$77,000 of which he said is a consern
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
conservative figure should probably be
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
more so it seems to me that we are at a
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
we are at a pivotal point in time
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
here where whether you like the judges
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
ruling or not to me is
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because it's going to go to
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court and frankly the
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's going to say the same
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
thing fix
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
it so I think it's incumbent upon this
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
group and the legislature to finally
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
after after 30
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
years to come up with a formula whether
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's input formula whether it's output
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
formula you know where I am on that my
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
equity we've never really looked at the
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
issue of equity other than a little more
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
money for this district and a little
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
more money for that District that hasn't
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
met the need so my hope Mr chairman is
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
that somewhere between now and the end
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
of this legislative session we will
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
finally be begin to take our
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fix this for all the
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
state you want me to re react to that
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I I the sheet that I have here this
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet right here which was
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
provided to us several weeks ago current
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
law adequacy Aid per pupil in this state
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
FY 2025 6,82 $ 5 we're close we're
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
close and so so so to say fix it I I
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
think that the legislature has the
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to cost this education
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
and I will also agree with you there's
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
areas which have not been updated that
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
need to be updated but it doesn't mean
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
that that whole formula which was
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
established and and and and discussed
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
again later in
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
17 that it's not able to do the job we
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
have certainly tinkered with this
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
formula over the years around the edge
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
and taken probably some of the good
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
things out of what we had in 2008 that
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
are no longer there we we we took and
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
and made put a stabilization component
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
in 150 something million dollars in
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
stabilization to make the formula work
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
that was not needed in the 2008 model if
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
you look carefully at it the hold
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
harmless within that model was around 20
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
something million dollar total 2427
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
million somewhere in that neighborhood
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we had a formula that was there the
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
augen same thing if we had funded it
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
properly we probably wouldn't be here
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
today so so you know I I I'm not saying
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not trying to say that
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
the whole formula is broken I don't
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
think we've taken the time properly in
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
the interim to reflect upon the changes
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
that are going on in our inflationary
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
Society uh that we living in and all
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
that to make sure that we're we're
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
meeting some of the wages that a teacher
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
requires to be Survivor and have housing
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
Etc um I couldn't do it on on $4,100 you
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
know whatever we're doing in here yet
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's there's a lot of local
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility in here too where I can
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
look on that sheet where it talks what
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
are the beginning salaries you can look
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
at Handover someplace and it's huge they
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pay for that whereas
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
others are $40,000 for that starting
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
teacher or even less
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I respectfully
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with you I do think the current
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
funding formula is broken uh I think
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
courts have said that but I haven't come
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
to that conclusion because of what the
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
courts uh are saying I'm I'll just refer
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
to what you just you know sort of held
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
up right right here and I'll I'll pick
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
out a few um um a few ones that can sort
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
of jump off easily the uh current law
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid per pupil fiscal year 2025
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
right from that sheet look at Jackson
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
$3,929 per pupil go right before it
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hudson $
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
4,9 $61 per pupil so Jackson gets nearly
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
twice the adequacy aid that that Hudson
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
gets go down to the bottom of that page
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom Newcastle
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
$41,000 uh
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
$41,900 per pupil in state adequacy aid
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
go right above it to Newbury
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
$1,450 per student adequacy go right
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
above that to New Boston now we're
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
talking about small towns for
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
$4,700 per student inadequacy Aid if
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
people think that's not broken that that
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
that is completely illogical to uh to
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
have a um to have a funding system that
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
that that I mean talk about spread or or
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know disperate spread which is what
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
what represent spilburg was talking
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
about this this shouldn't be anywhere
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
near what we're what we're seeing here
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
the formula is broken the funding
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
commission concluded that the formula
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
was broken they said it was broken not
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
just for taxpayers but for students too
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
and how can it not be broken for
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
students when the students are being
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
funded by the state at nearly
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
$42,000 per student in Newcastle and in
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
in um in New Durham at $5,100 per
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
student how could it not be broken in
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
terms of student outcomes and I know
 
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
you're not an outcome base guy you're an
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
input based guy but I think there's room
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
here to look at both and my background's
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
engineering Rick you know that not
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
education so so you know I've been
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
involved with probably more you know
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
tech companies than I than I care to
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
talk about but in in all of that that
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
experience we looked at both in about
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
both inputs and outcomes when when when
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
building products and I'm not trying to
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
equate students with widgets or anything
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
like that but you have quality assurance
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that what goes into the
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
system is is is is correct um that's the
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
that's an input driven thing and then
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
you have quality control does the
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
product perform you know ultimately
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's what happens I mean you can you
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully when when we when when we
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
build cars and aircraft
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
we look at both of those things not
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
saying well you know we put the right
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
parts in it should work great you test
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
both and um and
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
so I think there's there's a lot of room
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
both on the formula and on the
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
approach I'm not just input person I
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
think accountability is very very
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
important and performance outcome is
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
very important and I believe our current
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
statutory language references
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
performance and out outcomes if you look
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
at the 2008
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
Formula and if we had that formula in
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
place today which had fiscal capacity
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid based upon medium family
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
incomes and property valuation if we had
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
a differentiate Aid component in free
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch where that money was
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
allocated out based upon a weighted
 
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
formula it had the waterfall effects in
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
it representative Heath and we that's
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
not the way to do it it needs to be a a
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
slide if we funded in accordance with
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
that formula where would we be today
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
does anybody know I would I would bet
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we'd be a lot closer to where you
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
want to be if we were to follow what
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
Senator esbrook and Company did and I
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
know my party back then would was in a
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
minority on that but that's where we are
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we've come I've come to appreciate
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
that formula I don't think it's
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
something we need to throw away in the
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
trash can and say it's not it has no
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
potential potential for work we have
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
chipped away at it in 2011 we murdered
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
it and now here we
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
are so I think that in any look we need
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
to be open to looking at everything we
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
can to ensure we get the best for this
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
state agree agree okay I yeah I I think
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're I I from for one absolutely agree
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
with what you just said we need to take
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
a a a a look Square on at that original
 
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
formula in uh in
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
2008 and see where that takes us we need
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
to look at this Foundation opportunity
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
budget Formula 2 and we need to uh come
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
to some judgment as to what's the better
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
way to go you know it's as simple as
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
that but it's complicated okay I think
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've you know hammered on this one bill
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
that which is the base cost let's let's
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
get to the the swep
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
we it sounds like everything we want to
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
study but you know I'm I'm a little
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
concerned that from a policy perspective
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
in the committee I don't know if we
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
have I think there are some changes
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
which we could make just recognizing
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
that a a 1 to 30 a one to 25 this is a
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation I made back in the
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
20178 18 study represent mil you were on
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
that and I talked about the pupil
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio and how that needs to be
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
looked at we haven't looked at it
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
seriously I think we need to look at
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
that now and regardless of where we go
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
in the future we need to reflect that in
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
our costing out an adequate education so
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the policy committee I'll be really
 
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:44.950 align:start position:0%
in the policy committee I'll be really
pushing

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
for for some change to reflect you know
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
get closer to where we want to get
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's the way to do it maybe
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
maybe some study will figure that out
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
but rep some M your red lights on well
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
well I was going to just say I mean you
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I both
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored the bill that created the U
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
2018 study and my position was what your
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
position was on the commission I did not
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
support the recommendation out the 2018
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
I thought I thought represent umberger
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
did a a very good job in bringing forth
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
material which we didn't have a chance
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
to really look at and evaluate that's
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
why then I introduced the bill for the
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
the uh commission to look at it in 2020
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
for the very reason that I didn't think
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
that the 2018 had time to look at it and
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
I think that the 2020 did did have a
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it and there's
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
substance in there to try to bring both
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
components together to try to see how we
 
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
can deal with not only the fair funding
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
of it but also I'm going to go back to
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
the issue of where's the equity I'm I I
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
want to for me my bias is I want to have
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
the program student centered not things
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
centered because I think we missed the
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look to see how the
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
formula can impact student performance
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
rather than just trying to to look at
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
this widget and that widget and this is
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
how much it cost that's my bias but I I
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
I would concur with with representative
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
Ames I want to look at both of them to
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
see if we can find some way with which
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
we can deal with the the concept of the
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
input but also figure out how perhaps
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
that input model can then be more
 
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
student focused to make sure that
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
there's Equity so that kids across this
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the state have some sense of equal
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity because we know they don't
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
have equal opportunity right now based
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
upon the structure the formula that we
 
01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.390 align:start position:0%
upon the structure the formula that we
currently

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
have okay yeah we're from policy and
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
policy has a lot of discussion going on
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
and and what we got to do is we got to
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.719 --> 01:19:11.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay those people are on the
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here how are you seeing
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
1583 1583 is the bill dealing with the
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
base cost of 10 10
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
grand do that should that be an inun
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
study or or can this bill be amended to
 
01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
reflect a a base cost which would
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
influence those people designing the
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
budget which would be coming up in
 
01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.510 align:start position:0%
budget which would be coming up in
another

01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.430 align:start position:0%
another
year

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
um um so do we want to jump start a
 
01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
little bit or or you on them not saying
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
that's the end product but do we
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
recognize there are some holes and do we
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
want to amend something but doesn't that
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
but doesn't that one also blend in with
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
the conversation in general with where
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
where we might want to go I mean to just
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
to take that in isolation with the other
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
conversation we've had this morning
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
seems to be antithetical to the idea of
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
trying to look at the various options
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
because clearly is one of them there's
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
no question about that uh but I don't
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have time this
 
01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.310 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have time this
particular

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
Bill isn't mentioned at all in the
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
foundation formula no $10 million it's
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
separate the other one 27 is a direct
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
result of the 4.29 weighted factor and
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
the foundation bill
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
is with that but this right here is kind
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
of like a separate bill talking about
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
base cost do we want to are we satisfied
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
that the base costs then remain at
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
$4,100 are we satisfied that the pupil
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio remain 1 to3 and 1 to 25
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
can we make some simple suggestions
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
through this bill and use as a a bill to
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
to to address those issues so represent
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
cascad she had her hand up um my opinion
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
is that we don't act on this bill by
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
itself because I feel history is going
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
to repeat itself we're going to come out
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
with another number it's not going to be
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
10 might be five who knows what it's
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to be and we're going to agree to
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
that then it's kicking the can down the
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
road again and we haven't resolved the
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
situation so can't we include this bill
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
in the interim study because we talked
 
01:21:27.159 --> 01:21:28.950 align:start position:0%
in the interim study because we talked
about

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
1586 includes the whole package and
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of parts to
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
it but I don't think we should isolate
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
this particular bill but this there's no
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
inputs like this in the foundation
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
budget or a foundation package are
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
there I didn't see that it was all the
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
outcome right so so this is a compromise
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
study just my thought to move are there
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts from the rest of the
 
01:22:06.189 --> 01:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee here you know representa luno
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
so notwithstanding inputs and outcomes
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
um and just looking at at
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
1583 when you and and Mr chair you you
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
and I certainly worked hard together col
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
collaboratively during the budget
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
process in looking at at the the uniform
 
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
base cost as well as the differentiated
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
Aid factors and you talked about the
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
current budget we're in right now
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
current budget that we're in right now
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
we talked about 400 4,300 400 absolutely
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
and and you know the current budget
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
we're in right now has a costing formula
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
that is very much looks like what's in
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
in 1586 too I mean it's a base cost and
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
then differentiated factors albe at the
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
numbers are different but but what when
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
you when you just look at at turning the
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
dial on the base
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
cost let's let's let's look at Berlin so
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at that you know what what
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
you had passed out last week looking at
 
01:23:14.669 --> 01:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
Berlin so turning the dial on the base
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
cost from 4100 to
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
9479 I think is what uh the department
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
modeled here
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
Berlin's um
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh average student aid goes from
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
$122,000 to 13 well $
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
$3,876 it doesn't really move that that
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
that all that much it goes from what to
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
what 12 12,000
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
$3,876 um where and and and let me just
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
sort of look up to um
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
doubles so I I'm just be
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
because because our funding formula is
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
so out of whack at at this point when
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
you turn a dial with just one number and
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
you think you're going to do a good job
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
for Claremont and Berlin and Pittsfield
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and all the the towns that that that are
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
really and Manchester that are really
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
struggling when you turn just that one
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
dial of
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
uniform Universal and and Rochester
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely um it it it doesn't actually
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
put the State dollars where you
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
think you you want you want them to go
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the the the
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
Department's the department spreadsheet
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
she on this bears that out so so I I
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a good reason for interim
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
study so that this bill can be looked at
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
along with the other it's not it's not
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
road to interim study this because I
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
think just increasing that number
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't address the school
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
funding um problems that that that we've
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
got it's more complicated than that and
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's more complic ated than what this
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
bill does and it's more complicated than
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
what the conval Su I I would like to
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
speak to that point because in finance
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
we turned a
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
dial and yeah and what happened was we I
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
think appropriated 150 million dollars
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
additional for all of the special
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
requirements once the crank got turned
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
on that it didn't move the needle hardly
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
at all because 80% of those funds went
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
to NASA Manchester and con
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
and nothing to Berlin I mean the towns
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
that don't have the tax base didn't
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
benefit so and I'm just bringing this
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
out because whatever the formula is
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
we've never even talked about that in
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
this committee so far that was a big
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
issue as we felt well you know our towns
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
are doing fine those towns aren't let's
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
put some more money in it didn't do a
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
thing so that Crank that had the
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
stabilization built into it I called it
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
the thumb on the scale the stabilization
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
process seemed to
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
normalize I'll give with a small end the
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
disparities but that's why you have some
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
towns getting 15,000 student and others
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
getting eight but that was the thumb on
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
the scale in the back room I don't know
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
if you can formulize that that's that's
 
01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.109 align:start position:0%
if you can formulize that that's that's
I've

01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
I've
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
been upset about that ever since we
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
passed the budget is how do we fix it
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
because we we were sitting in this room
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even understand all of the
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
issues and it's like and I don't think
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're stupid people but we just couldn't
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
comprehend all of the complexity so I
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you as moveing the
 
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
can tell you as moveing the
dial

01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
dial
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
zipo so there is there is a something
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
onair just in response to what
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative ammer was talking about I
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that and and and I
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
applaud the budget process the work that
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
was done and looking at moving several
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
dials as as you did um um but you're
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
right it didn't accomplish everything
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we thought and that it that it that
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
it should accomplish um and I and I know
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're thinking you know interim study on
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
1586 and I absolutely think that that
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense but 1586 does move
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of dials and and my understanding
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
is that Mr manelo from the Department is
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
going to be here this afternoon with
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
some spreadsheets whether we're going to
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
be look look my understanding is that he
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
is oh he is I see the head going up and
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
down yeah I talked to Mark yesterday
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and and and so so and and I'm I'm
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
not I I haven't even seen the
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets I know he's running a bunch
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
of different models on he done he had
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
them done last night by four o' but but
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm saying is we we you
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
don't even need to like look at the
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
numbers and say well this is too much in
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
total or too little in total I'm not
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
even I don't even want to argue that but
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
but you can you can see from looking at
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
that that that that it it it does a much
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
better job to to pushing State dollars
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
where they're needed most and and um and
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so you know thinking places like
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester you know and and even with
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
all the money that that the the
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
additional dollars that that got pushed
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
to Manchester um you know um chairman
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
par was I think quoted in I don't know
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
where I read it over over over the last
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
week um that that you know we're we're
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
still our our budget is still $50
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
million short of just being
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
average average per pup uh cost and that
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's not even factoring in all
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
of the extenuating challenges that uh
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
that the city of Manchester has with
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
regards to their population so so I'm
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
just saying that that that we that there
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
are that when when when when looking at
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
the frustration that we have with the
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
current formula and turning the limited
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
dials that we've got there that there
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
may be better approaches to it and I
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
Know It Takes it's a it's a big bill
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to there's a lot of
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
changes that would still need to be
 
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
considered as represent dry um talked
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
about last week as well as this morning
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with that
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
um but uh but as far as a model you can
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
sort of see how how you know maybe
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
there's something we could do that does
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
a better job than represent
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
Kad just to add to that a little bit
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
then I go back to the commission it was
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
such hard work over an entire
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
year for the representatives that
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
weren't part of that commission we ended
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
up having um research company develop a
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
simulator tool for the very reason that
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
we recognize that diff different size of
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
districts different expenses are going
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
to vary all over the state it's you know
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
far from being uniform and the needs are
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
different and this particular simulator
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
tool would allow us to take individual
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire districts and plug in all
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
variables and it would I'm not a math
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
person crank it out and then it would
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
pull it
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
out and it seemed like it it fed and so
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
I don't want to throw that whole
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
development out the door to get to where
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
we want to head head to so I just wanted
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
to you know let the others know that
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
there was a tool developed for New
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns and school districts
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
that allowed us to plug it in to see if
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
the final outcome seemed Equitable
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
seemed Fair seemed appropriate for that
 
01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
region that rural school at city school
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
and accounting for those elll students
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
that are in high numbers in some
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
districts and non-existent others so
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
that does
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
exist um if that's something helpful for
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
this committee well there's two sides to
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
this formula remember the left-and side
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the right hand side and the right
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
hand side has the grant money
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant based upon
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
request property valuation for those
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
students which qualify f&amp;r
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
um used to have medium family income and
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid which did
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
I think contribute to making the formula
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
work fiscal capacity disparity Aid was
 
01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.470 align:start position:0%
work fiscal capacity disparity Aid was
taken

01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
out and there be it and and also within
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
how we but we had a formula that was I
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
believe had the potential for
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
working and so if we have an interim
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
study you know I I I would hope that
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
that would be part of the you know the
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
the equation for studying uh yeah yes
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I and I agree I think all
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
these are so interrelated that it would
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
be hard to study one without studying
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
all of them um uh have we been on the
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
outside looking at things from all the
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
way back from the augen BL formula
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
through all these different changes it
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be very informative and very
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
helpful to me to go back and look at
 
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
some of these uh previous formulas and
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
studies thank you you so is it the
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
feeling of a group right here that inter
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
room study is probably the best way to
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
go on this one as well this bill we
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
haven't talked to
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
swep Y yep okay so the the last
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
bill which is
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill I'll just put my cards on the table
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
right now I I'm not support of the
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
excess being having to be returned from
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
the the particular District that's
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
raising it I feel that that money ought
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be directed specifically to
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
educational tasks within that District
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
whether it be for their own building Aid
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
or catastrophic Aid or ensuring that
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
they can have that Spanish teacher in in
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
um that's excess and how much are we
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
talking on excess is it roughly $30
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
million yeah 29 point something
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
yes it it I don't have the exact figure
 
01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
we get it from Mark I thought it was a
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
little over call it $30 million
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
278 I think going after this animal is
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
just going to cause a real fight and it
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like in terms of trying to
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
get this costing of this
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
budget it's going to take more than that
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know just this the changes I you
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
know I suggest this morning by doing the
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
costing here of the adequate education
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
through that changing it to the 42
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
560 and with the special ed cost it
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
comes up to $115 million on top of what
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
we're spending right
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
now so it's going to be big money in
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
terms of unless you can figure out some
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
magic trick here to keep it where we are
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
right now and we don't have to go the
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
property tax or the income tax sales tax
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
route representing you add it up just a
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
second before
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
represent we're in competition
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh first I I want to
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh everyone should know that there are
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
bills Ways and Means also on this very
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
same subject uh and we just had our
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
hearing when was it uh the day before
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday on uh two bills one uh is
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsored by rep of
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
fellows and that one essentially repeals
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
swept and inserts uh ways of of uh
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
leading to a soft Landing to
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
oversimplify what you've done um and
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
then another bill by
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative can you do
 
01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative can you do
it

01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh Bickford representative Bickford has
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
a bill he's the sole Prime Sole sponsor
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor his his
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill um sends the access
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
to to Dr and into the education trust
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
fund so it leaves swept intact but uh
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
diverts the exess to uh to the uh state
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
level uh we haven't really discussed
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
those we just had hearings on them
 
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.830 align:start position:0%
those we just had hearings on them
yesterday

01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
or the day before um so those are
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
sitting out there in addition there's a
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
bill that I filed uh a couple years ago
 
01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.510 align:start position:0%
bill that I filed uh a couple years ago
that

01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh was addressed uh as a retained bill
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
came to the floor this this year and was
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
sent to interim study in ways and means
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
and that bill um accepts the what I
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
believe is the uh really almost
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
indisputable legal truth that this is a
 
01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.790 align:start position:0%
indisputable legal truth that this is a
state

01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
tax and and sends the excess
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
swept and all other swept Revenue all at
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
once to the state level and then um has
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
an augmented free and reduced price
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
lunch program that is funded from the
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
state level as a rebate program uh and
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
also provides a 3% processed in fee for
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh localities who ra who collect the
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
money and send it to the state so I
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
those are out there the the latter one
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
is actually in
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
1586 uh the the uh my
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
bill essentially the same I mean there
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
are technical changes that need to be
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
made I have prepared an amendment to uh
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
to the other swep bill there's so many
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
numbers here it's hard to keep track U
 
01:37:52.719 --> 01:37:53.790 align:start position:0%
numbers here it's hard to keep track U
to

01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
1686 to uh substitute my Approach for
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
that approach so I'm not here to argue
 
01:38:00.599 --> 01:38:01.430 align:start position:0%
that approach so I'm not here to argue
I'm

01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
not I'm not arguing for any one of these
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
approaches I'm not sure which way to go
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
to be truthful but uh they're all out
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
there uh they all are the product of the
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
feeling that we've got a legal problem
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
here with the uh state tax and what to
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
do with the revenue I believe that uh
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
the judge was absolutely right in his
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion I know Bill ardinger uh
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
strongly agrees with that who work with
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
me and the others on various things
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
including the commission work uh and uh
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
that one way or the other we've got to
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
do something about this is the the
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
decision of the Jud of the suprior court
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
judge is in appeal so maybe there some
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
time time to work on it on the other
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
hand we're collecting an illegal un
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
potentially unconstitutional tax and uh
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
some gray uh area there and what uh the
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
consequences of collecting an
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional tax are um so that's
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
just background I'm not sure where I'm
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
going with this but I just wanted you to
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
have all of that yeah uh we have two of
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of 1686 sitting at the
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
table here representa spillsbury and
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden um you're a
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor on the
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill yeah so representative I'd like to
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
add a few comments if I
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
can so as representative Ames just
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
indicated if you include what's embedded
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
in 1586 there are four bar four bills to
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
each in education Ways and Means
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
carrying three different concepts to
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
achieve more or less the same thing the
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
most straightforward is the uh Pickford
 
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
bill which which simply restores the
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
language that was repealed in 2011 to
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
bring us to the status quo anti take us
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
back 12 years for 13 years
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm a co-sponsor of
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
1686 um representative Mart Smith's
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know that it's a clean
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
solution it's just simply that I agree
 
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
that um it needs to be resolved
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether it gets resolved by you know
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
Committee Action February 15th or goes
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
to interim study I just think it's an
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
essential thing that has to be resolved
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of the funding
 
01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
formula and perhaps ahead of the funding
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
formula um
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we've got a situation
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
where a local tax is masquerading as a
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
state tax and we kind of wanted it to be
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
both things depending on you know um
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
where we sit and how we try to justify
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
things so I completely
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
understand why a um property relatively
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
wealthy community would want to
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
retain the so-called excess amount
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's been collected from their
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
own uh
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers property
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I uh I actually sympathize with they
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to keep what they rais
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
locally when I think of it that way it
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
just tells me that raising the state's
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
contribution in any portion whatsoever
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
off of property tax is the original sin
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
correct we have folks from Dr here on
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
this do and you've written a fiscal note
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
here for for us is there anything you
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
can add to help us out with this or
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill the ramifications
 
01:41:58.599 --> 01:41:59.669 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill the ramifications
impacts

01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
up uh Keen mang Wong tax policy councel
 
01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
at the Dr um as so the Dr doesn't really
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
take any position on the bill um I think
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's kind of expected um what the DI
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
did was essentially just went through
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh identified like how it
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
would work um and any kind of uh
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
technical issues that we saw and and we
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
just flaged that on the fiscal note um
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so I I wouldn't know if um if
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
so our comments were basic mainly just
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
technical in nature um I think the
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
discussion here is very policy based um
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
and I I I hesit to to wander into
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
area Okay are are there any questions
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
note yes represent
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much uh Mr chair and
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for joining us this
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
morning um there's there obviously
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion with
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
regards to the Statewide property tax
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
and how it's collected how it's
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
administered um how some of it is
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
remitted how some of it's retained and
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
stuff like that um in part of those
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
discussions and we had these discussions
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
during the commission work too there was
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion that that the um that the the
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
state through the Department of Revenue
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh Administration
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
should collect that tax directly from
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
every property taxpayer and and I don't
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
actually believe that that's the right I
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
think it should be collected locally and
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
um um because the local um tax clerks
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are doing property tax
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
collection and and they're obviously
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
doing it for the counties and and
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
remitting it too but I was wondering if
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
if the Dr were to collect
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
the um the swept from every property
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Crown the same what would that
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
what would that what would that mean for
 
01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.629 align:start position:0%
what would that what would that mean for
the

01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
Dr um thank you for the question so um
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
that would mean that uh so we we will
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
need to sort of revamp our system
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
because currently our system is not
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
built to collect that sum of money so be
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
it the excess swept or be it the entire
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
swept that is being calculated
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
um we would need
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
certain um measures in place such as we
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
need to know whether uh would the the
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
remitting of that money to the Dr is
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
that going to be done only once a year
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
versus is it being done every time when
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
the property bill goes out and then um
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
is it like a twice a year or quarterly
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
or once a year so I the we would
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate the cleaner option would be
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
once a year so not withstanding how the
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities would to build their uh
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
send out their property tax how often
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
they send out their property tax
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
B the easier option for the Dr to manage
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
is to receive it only once a year and
 
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
then the other consideration is whether
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh would the municipalities be remitting
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
the total amount that's
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
calculated whe whether they were
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
successful in collecting the entire
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
amount or not so that would be
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
considered as we we need to think about
 
01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
that um and and then let's say if um if
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
the uh if the amount is remitted is not
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
as what is provided in the
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
warrant then who goes about in
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
collecting that outstanding amount um
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing would be our uh
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
our Technical Systems uh we probably
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
need to upgrade our systems to be able
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
to monitor um the each municipality the
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
amounts that uh we expecting to receive
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh from the uh from the warrants and
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
then how much we've been receiving and
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
then just to keep everything uh keep
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
track of everything that probably about
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
uh we anticipate probably about uh I
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
believe the number was about $300,000
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
just to update that system
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
dry thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
question I kind of like to change the
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
subject just a little bit there was some
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
talk in the last few hearings about ways
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
that a negative netive tax rate could be
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
set that were different from this the
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
swept um
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
overcharge uh do you remember those I
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
think it was Mr manganello from the doe
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
that brought that up but yeah there was
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on the negative rates during
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
the public hearing uh of it but I think
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
invite um my colleague here who might be
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
well uh Bruce canor uh who might be able
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
to explain the uh the workings of a
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
negative rate um my understanding that
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
negative rate is a function of the math
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's involved um and it it's just a
 
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
natural occurrence uh but maybe Bruce
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
can explain it
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
better y you're welcome we got to get
 
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
at we just drag one
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
up we don't have this big
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
audience uh good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee members um for the record my
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
name is Bruce canu I'm the supervisor of
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
the municipal Bureau at the Department
 
01:47:54.159 --> 01:47:55.189 align:start position:0%
the municipal Bureau at the Department
of

01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue that Bureau is tasked with um
 
01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:01.719 align:start position:0%
helping the commissioner calculate the
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
property tax rates so uh the team I work
 
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
with we are probably some of the most
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
familiar people in the state with
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
negative property tax
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
rates um the representative I think was
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
referring to the distinction between
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
how those negative property tax rates
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
arise in conjunction with the State
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
education property tax rate and the the
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
debates and discussions and outcome of
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
the one court case but it is possible
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
and there have been
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
examples of a negative property tax rate
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
being calculated and used um at the
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
we'll refer to it as the municipal I
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
think town I don't know that I can think
 
01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
of an example of a city so a town it
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
arises from the same
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
um type of situation where
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
non non-property tax revenues exceed the
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation amount that's been voted
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
and that math just drives us to a
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
negative sum which is then placed in as
 
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
the numerator on a fraction that gives
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
us the tax rate hence we end up with a
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
negative tax
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
rate um the math
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
also has its own natural
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
implication given the fact that when we
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
produce a tax rate tax rates and send it
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
Municipality of course everybody here if
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
you're a property tax owner knows your
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
bill is some amount per
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
thousand but is made up of four
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
rates so so it's pure mathematics at
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that point that if one of those rates is
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
negative the entire total is that much
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
less uh the implications of that are
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
municipality

01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
and each situation creates its own set
 
01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:15.950 align:start position:0%
and each situation creates its own set
of

01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.669 align:start position:0%
of
ramifications

01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
locally um in fact we are currently
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
watching those ramifications play out
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
municipality and um there's really no
 
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
further role for the department at that
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
point but that is what happens and it
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
has happened and I would note as a
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
historical curiosity and I looked at
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
this because I'm naturally
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
curious is that uh this year we saw to
 
01:50:52.079 --> 01:50:53.750 align:start position:0%
curious is that uh this year we saw to
Municipal

01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
rates uh end up being
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
negative and they both occurred and our
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
when we produce our list of rates every
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
week it's
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
alphabetical and I thought hm I wonder
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
if this has ever happened before and I
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
went back to the oldest record that I
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
1975 and I was really I'm quite stunned
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
the same two
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities back then there were only
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
three rates of
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
course they had negative Municipal rates
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
so 48 years I think later um the same
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
phenomenon occurred again and probably
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't the only time in history but it
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
was just the fact that I looked at the
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
oldest one go ahead yeah so thank you
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
that just makes me ask if the bills Pro
 
01:51:52.109 --> 01:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
prohibition on the Dr from setting
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
negative local and County tax rates on
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
real property kind of steps into
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
territory that doesn't have to do with
 
01:51:59.199 --> 01:52:01.109 align:start position:0%
territory that doesn't have to do with
education

01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:52:01.119 --> 01:52:02.750 align:start position:0%
education
taxes

01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
um specifically I mean if that bill was
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
law I believe the bureau would stop the
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
rate at zero it wasn't would not go
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
negative and it would apply and I think
 
01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
there was a question and it may have
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
been in in
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh the other hearing as to whether or
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
not the agency would see the word
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
local um as meaning Municipal um I can't
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
speak with definitively for the agency
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that they the the attorney and
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and as well would want
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
to weigh in it seems for me the most
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
natural initial reading of the the law
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
that all the rates would be subject to
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
the same you know prohibition it's not
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
quite clear
 
01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:55.719 align:start position:0%
but representative cascaden thank you uh
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I'm
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
interpreting now your explanation that
 
01:53:03.149 --> 01:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
it the negative tax rate did not only
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
apply to unincorporated
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
locations there are
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
corporated or Incorporated yes
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities yes there are oh okay
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
that was that's a revelation to me I
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
always thought it was unincorporate at
 
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
locations that work that negative
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
certainly the the one court case
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
highlighted the fact because of the
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
nature of the unincorporated being so
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
small and in some cases having
 
01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
almost no people involved hence no
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
pupils to create a school district an
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
act an active School District you you'd
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
see you see it much more often there and
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
then and the nature of that case
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
involved the local school rate and it's
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
and the swep so
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of the
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
Dr it's an interesting topic yes sir it
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
is really is it ought to stop at
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
zero thank you very much
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah so what we're going to do
 
01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
is we're going to take a break right now
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's right at 12 o'clock and there's
 
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
no heat in this room as you know we'd
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
have no hea in the building and there's
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
a pipe broken somewhere so uh we're
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
going to take a moment to warm our hands
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
up have a little lunch and we'll come
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
back at
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
oh I don't think we need you back here I
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.679 --> 03:03:01.790 align:start position:0%
 
hook

03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:04.110 --> 03:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
when you're ready to go ahead we are
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
kind of limited on time in the afternoon
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.479 --> 03:03:14.110 align:start position:0%
 
appointment

03:03:14.110 --> 03:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
and I got a 4:30 doctor's appointment in
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
Le they check my blood to make sure the
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
 in the thinner is where it's
 
03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:26.670 --> 03:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
be the other day was like 1.6 oh you
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.469 --> 03:03:37.479 align:start position:0%
said Fray next
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
Friday it's in the calendar yeah
 
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
yep yeah yeah we'll hopefully have a
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
little bit more info back on the CATE
 
03:03:50.790 --> 03:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
cat categories for special ed we may
 
03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
have some actual costs I don't know we
 
03:03:53.590 --> 03:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
we'll find
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
out welcome Mark
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh you got it's fun yeah uh Mark M
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Bureau of school
 
03:04:04.590 --> 03:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
Finance um so you do have um uh two
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
packets in front of you um hopefully you
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't get them mixed around the first
 
03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
packet is walking through um or both
 
03:04:13.870 --> 03:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
packets what this is doing is this is
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
1586 but not as introduced uh
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I um uh played
 
03:04:21.630 --> 03:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
around with a couple different variables
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variables that can be
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
played around in this uh formula uh 1586
 
03:04:29.229 --> 03:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
as as introduced by representative luno
 
03:04:32.269 --> 03:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
um so some of the variables that uh were
 
03:04:35.070 --> 03:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
discussed was changing the universal Aid
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
amount and so um I think we talked about
 
03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
this a little bit last week um plugging
 
03:04:40.990 --> 03:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
in that conal number the minimum base
 
03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
Aid that conal uh said was $7,000 uh
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's the Superior Court decision um
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
7,356 so plugging that number in there
 
03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
um that was one change that made as
 
03:04:51.870 --> 03:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
introduced it was
 
03:04:53.950 --> 03:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
6,500 um another change that
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative luno uh discussed with me
 
03:04:59.790 --> 03:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
was um the minimum contribution amount
 
03:05:03.550 --> 03:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
um um making that not $5 but I believe
 
03:05:04.670 --> 03:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's you'll see it on the second
 
03:05:05.830 --> 03:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet when we get there but it's
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
$425 we can discuss how that works
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
mechanically through the formula um
 
03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
another change from what was introduced
 
03:05:16.389 --> 03:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
is is um the phase in uh which we'll
 
03:05:18.790 --> 03:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
talk about um instead of being 70% and
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
phasing in over 10 years representative
 
03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
Luna was interested in um potentially
 
03:05:24.429 --> 03:05:24.439 align:start position:0%
pursuing phasing in in over 5 years and
 
03:05:28.510 --> 03:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
having an 80% um percentage phase in so
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
basically that was the scenario I ran
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
you have two packets the the money is on
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
the backs side so if you can just be
 
03:05:36.469 --> 03:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
patient um with the two towns
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
highlighted Allenstown and Alton that
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
one has the dollar amounts but if we can
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
just first walk through the weights um I
 
03:05:43.870 --> 03:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
should think think we should be able to
 
03:05:46.229 --> 03:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
go through this relatively quickly um
 
03:05:47.469 --> 03:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
but I'll I'll walk through how the
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
formula the weights of the formula works
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
first so just like any other adequacy
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet this is by municipality so
 
03:05:58.469 --> 03:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
you can see the town by Town um so in um
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
at the top there it's column A that's
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
just admr um and so that is admr um as
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
we estimated it to be for school year
 
03:06:11.710 --> 03:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
24 uh so I plugged in that number um and
 
03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
an admr is weighted at one so no weight
 
03:06:16.190 --> 03:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
well really just a standard weight it's
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
weighted at one so aworth has 94 admr so
 
03:06:22.269 --> 03:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
for this formula we are waiting them at
 
03:06:27.790 --> 03:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
one um fnr um is uh for aworth we have
 
03:06:27.800 --> 03:06:43.150 align:start position:0%
one um fnr um is uh for aworth we have
32.242262

03:06:43.150 --> 03:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.710 --> 03:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
students weighted at 1.49 turns into 48
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
students uh 48 weights
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
really sped is being weighted at 4.29 I
 
03:06:56.349 --> 03:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
know you've been discussing this um so
 
03:06:58.750 --> 03:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
slow down just a second special
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
education ADM you have 4.29 got it you
 
03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
said 48
 
03:07:08.590 --> 03:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
weights sorry I'm following aworth we're
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
doing aworth let me slow down um aworth
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
94 admr is weighted one is 94 that's
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
column B column C is fnr of aworth of
 
03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:43.469 align:start position:0%
column B column C is fnr of aworth of
32.242262

03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
process um English language Learners
 
03:07:47.550 --> 03:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
there's zero within aworth there's one
 
03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
within Alexandria so one English
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
language learner is weighted at
 
03:07:55.870 --> 03:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
2.2 so we are now for Alexandria they
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a weight of 2.2 in their in their
 
03:08:00.910 --> 03:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
column there in column
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
H so the first part of this formula is
 
03:08:05.229 --> 03:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
working with these kind of Weights as
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're used to seeing them in regular Uh
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
current law adequacy um so in column I
 
03:08:14.830 --> 03:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're tallying those all up so um for
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
aworth we tally up the 94 weights the 48
 
03:08:22.349 --> 03:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
weights the 85.8 weights and we get
 
03:08:22.359 --> 03:08:24.510 align:start position:0%
weights the 85.8 weights and we get
227.04

03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
227.04
 
03:08:26.910 --> 03:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
weights and so that's somewhat
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward pretty similar to
 
03:08:31.110 --> 03:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
current adequacy um as far as telling up
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
the weights the weights are different
 
03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
than how we do it in adequacy but it's
 
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh somewhat
 
03:08:38.830 --> 03:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
similar so we're still in the process of
 
03:08:40.590 --> 03:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
figuring out the weights for each
 
03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
municipality the next one is a little
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
more comp complicated it's buckets ra I
 
03:08:46.990 --> 03:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
have described as buckets relative to
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
school district size so if you are under
 
03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
200 um where you're going to receive a
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
particular weight if you are between
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
2011 and 600 you're going to receive a
 
03:09:00.750 --> 03:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
weight um if you're between 601 to 12200
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
in school district size you're going to
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
receive a weight and aworth which is
 
03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
part of the Fall Mountain School
 
03:09:09.750 --> 03:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
District has an admr student population
 
03:09:14.229 --> 03:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
between 121 and 2,000 so I'm just coding
 
03:09:16.830 --> 03:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
them as they're going to receive however
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
many students they have in that weight
 
03:09:20.429 --> 03:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the weight they're
 
03:09:22.750 --> 03:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
categorized um if we go down to Albany
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
Alban is a very small school district
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
they have under 200 um actually they're
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
nonp product Cooperative so I can tell
 
03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
you what their adars it's it's uh 68.4
 
03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:32.710 align:start position:0%
you what their adars it's it's uh 68.4
or

03:09:32.710 --> 03:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:09:35.429 --> 03:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
68.4 so they have under 200 in their
 
03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
school district of Albany so they're
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
going to be bucketed as under 200 um so
 
03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
first we're bucketing where these School
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
school districts uh are where they kind
 
03:09:47.790 --> 03:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
of live as far as size is concerned
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
where it gets a little unique is if you
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
scroll down to Amherst which is location
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
code number 17 it's a few lines down um
 
03:09:57.150 --> 03:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see that
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
3268 and the uniqueness with uniqueness
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
with that is Amherst is a town that Bel
 
03:10:04.670 --> 03:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
has two school districts so um I'm just
 
03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
a portioning out what is Amherst the k
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
through eight and then what is Sagan
 
03:10:11.910 --> 03:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
which is the 9 through 12 and so um some
 
03:10:14.590 --> 03:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
of Amherst is part of the it's it's
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
single District Etc and some of it's a
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
split Cooperative um so that was kind of
 
03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
a just sort of a uniqueness as far as
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
how that
 
03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
applies but I'm just bucketing where
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
these school districts are the next
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
process is adding in the
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
weights so if we look back at
 
03:10:34.229 --> 03:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
aworth um I'm not showing you all the
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
work there's a lot of math behind this
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
and unhiding of a bunch of ex uh columns
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
would show this math but I'm just trying
 
03:10:43.710 --> 03:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
to present a highle um and not bore you
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
with too much math but aworth here um
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
essentially what I did with aworth is
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's part of Fall Mountain Fall Mountain
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
under HB uh
 
03:10:56.190 --> 03:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
1586 they have basically what you do is
 
03:11:00.870 --> 03:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
you do the negative so man the fractions
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
don't really show up really well in this
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet but it's negative uh I
 
03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
believe point 0
 
03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:08.229 align:start position:0%
believe point 0
point

03:11:08.229 --> 03:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:11:12.190 --> 03:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
0049 times the ADM of aworth so that's
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
times the
 
03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
4 um
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh with starting off with an intercept
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
of around one so basically we're just
 
03:11:24.790 --> 03:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
adding a negative a very small negative
 
03:11:26.349 --> 03:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
amount because it's a very small number
 
03:11:30.190 --> 03:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
here to that one ADM starting point so
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're not being really punished that
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
much they're being kind of benef uh well
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
yeah they're basically just getting a
 
03:11:40.349 --> 03:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
weight of of one there actually no
 
03:11:42.429 --> 03:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
they're basically having their weight
 
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
just disappear um yeah they're getting a
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
weight of one that's how I'm seeing that
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
oh no no no yeah weight of one is uh
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
sorry then I'm going to times it by
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
their students now now I can understand
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
my own spreadsheet um they're they're
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
getting 096 is what I'm going to Times
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
by The a worth number of 94 so they're
 
03:12:02.269 --> 03:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
going to get 96% of those 94 that's
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
their weight and it turns out to be 90.4
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
2 so it's a little technical there
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of sort of calculations
 
03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
happening in the
 
03:12:14.190 --> 03:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
background um Albany um is a small
 
03:12:15.750 --> 03:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
school district so they're going to have
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
a more advantageous weight um their
 
03:12:19.710 --> 03:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
weight ends up being
 
03:12:24.670 --> 03:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
1.3 and I do that 1.3 times the 68 and I
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
get 89.4 one weights so we talked a
 
03:12:29.309 --> 03:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
little bit about this last week where
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
this part of the formula uh in 1586
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
mostly benefits small school districts
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
like Albany um so Albany is getting um
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
1.31 weights for each student they have
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:43.349 align:start position:0%
1.31 weights for each student they have
um

03:12:43.349 --> 03:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:43.359 --> 03:12:44.229 align:start position:0%
um
moving

03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:12:44.239 --> 03:12:45.870 align:start position:0%
moving
forward

03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
yep um so the places like uh am that
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
have two
 
03:12:55.630 --> 03:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
numbers yes how do you how do you do
 
03:12:57.469 --> 03:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
that let's see how I did that I think I
 
03:12:59.830 --> 03:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
portioned it out but let me you
 
03:13:04.990 --> 03:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
did yep so 32% yeah so
 
03:13:08.110 --> 03:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
I 32%
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
is 32% of those students belong to the
 
03:13:13.150 --> 03:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
single District
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
and they were credited as
 
03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
um uh credited as the 601 to 1200 and
 
03:13:25.630 --> 03:13:25.640 align:start position:0%
then 30 and then 68% belonged to the um
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative I believe and they were
 
03:13:29.070 --> 03:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
credited as
 
03:13:30.990 --> 03:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
the9 weight
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
measurement so I'd have to get into the
 
03:13:36.269 --> 03:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
details of how I calculated it but I'd
 
03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
have to go into my spreadsheet but I a
 
03:13:40.750 --> 03:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
portioned it out based on so like 0.12
 
03:13:43.630 --> 03:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
times the numbers in that range and then
 
03:13:45.710 --> 03:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
9 and then add those together yeah I
 
03:13:48.190 --> 03:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
took I I I took basically I took the 30
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
Amherst has 1700 or 1,00 students but
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
32% of them um so not all 1,800 of them
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
are going to fall in the 601 bucket so
 
03:14:02.190 --> 03:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
basically I take am H and split it out
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
and then I have to combin it back
 
03:14:05.550 --> 03:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
together um but I had to put them in two
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
different buckets because you end up
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
with one number at the end yes okay so I
 
03:14:10.830 --> 03:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
split them out for a second and then put
 
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so if you tally up the district
 
03:14:20.990 --> 03:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
weights there um you'll see just staying
 
03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
on aworth aworth has
 
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
9.42 um Statewide that's 41 uh, weights
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
um we have another wave of waiting and
 
03:14:34.229 --> 03:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's based on grade level so Statewide
 
03:14:35.710 --> 03:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
36,000 um six and eth graders so six and
 
03:14:43.950 --> 03:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
eighth graders were given a weight of
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
1.42 so aworth has I don't have the raw
 
03:14:52.349 --> 03:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
data here but they have under 26 um I
 
03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't have to do the math but uh
 
03:14:58.550 --> 03:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
whatever 1.4 * x uh equals 26 x is the
 
03:14:59.790 --> 03:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
number of six and eighth graders they
 
03:15:00.830 --> 03:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
have I don't I don't know have that
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head but I've
 
03:15:03.550 --> 03:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
I've added the weights there I've taken
 
03:15:04.830 --> 03:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
all these six and eighth graders within
 
03:15:06.790 --> 03:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
aworth and I've multiplied that number
 
03:15:10.590 --> 03:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
by 1.42 and I got
 
03:15:14.190 --> 03:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
26 for GR 9 and 12 I did the same
 
03:15:18.389 --> 03:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
process um so aworth likely has around
 
03:15:23.550 --> 03:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
20ish um 9 and 12 grade graders and so
 
03:15:25.389 --> 03:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
when I take that number that raw number
 
03:15:26.910 --> 03:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
which is probably around 20 and I
 
03:15:30.790 --> 03:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
multiply it by 042 I get 11 so that's
 
03:15:32.750 --> 03:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
how we're dealing with the grade level
 
03:15:36.349 --> 03:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
weights and so at this part of the
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
formula we're done with the weights we
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
first we tally them all up for a the
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
total number of Weights ends up being
 
03:15:49.710 --> 03:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
265.0 4 so that includes their sort of
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
normal admr student counts which is 94
 
03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
plus all these different categories that
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
they get little they get add-ons for um
 
03:15:59.189 --> 03:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
like having a um like being a school
 
03:16:01.150 --> 03:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
district of a particular size like
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
having grade level students at a
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
particular grade um like having students
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
that are sped or fnr and so when we
 
03:16:08.269 --> 03:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
tally that up we get
 
03:16:08.279 --> 03:16:10.670 align:start position:0%
tally that up we get
265.0

03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
265.0
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
4 the way this and representative luno
 
03:16:14.510 --> 03:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
can explain this more in more detail but
 
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just sort of summarize at a high
 
03:16:17.870 --> 03:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
level the concept that he's explained to
 
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
um this committee and other committees
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
before is essentially he's tallying up
 
03:16:24.630 --> 03:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
all these numbers and
 
03:16:27.469 --> 03:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh the way it's my understanding is
 
03:16:30.229 --> 03:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
that he's trying to get to a number that
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
equals something approximate to the
 
03:16:34.349 --> 03:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
total State cost of Education minus
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
federal revenue is that a correct
 
03:16:39.550 --> 03:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation um so where we end up
 
03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
with these weights and with this metric
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
if I take the 400
 
03:16:46.389 --> 03:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
32,000 weights and I times it by
 
03:16:48.510 --> 03:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
7,356 and that was a number that was
 
03:16:50.429 --> 03:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
plugged in um and it's based on the
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
conval decision or uh uh number provided
 
03:16:56.670 --> 03:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
so if I tally up those
 
03:17:00.429 --> 03:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
432,000 uh weights and I multiply by
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
7,356 I get around 3.2 billion and so um
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
as representative luno talks about his
 
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
intent his intent was for that number to
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
represent approximately the state total
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
share of Revenue that goes to school
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
districts minus Federal um so in we're
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
generally in that ballpark there um you
 
03:17:19.189 --> 03:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
know give or take you know dozens of
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
millions but um we're it's a it's a
 
03:17:24.189 --> 03:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
large number 3.2
 
03:17:27.070 --> 03:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
billion can the the reason it's in that
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
ballpark isn't because it was finger and
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
the wind you know maybe we'll get close
 
03:17:33.229 --> 03:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's because of
 
03:17:35.469 --> 03:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
the work that the uh that the commission
 
03:17:39.910 --> 03:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
did in analyzing doe 25 data from all of
 
03:17:41.469 --> 03:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
the school districts knowing what that
 
03:17:44.429 --> 03:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
total cost is is knowing how those costs
 
03:17:47.590 --> 03:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
can be attributed to these different um
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid factors so there's
 
03:17:53.189 --> 03:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
there's there's no surprise that it
 
03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
comes within the ballpark yep and that's
 
03:17:56.830 --> 03:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so a lot of these weights and how
 
03:17:58.189 --> 03:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
these weights were determined represent
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
luno can speak to them because they deal
 
03:18:01.830 --> 03:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
with a 2020 commission report and the
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
report can um obviously walk you through
 
03:18:06.469 --> 03:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
them as well excuse me one more time um
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that number 3.2 billion is that
 
03:18:10.990 --> 03:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
before the federal money is taken out or
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
after the after okay so do you know that
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head um I know
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's in the ballpark I don't know um I
 
03:18:20.189 --> 03:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
don't have it off the top of my head
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
Federal no the federal number that you
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
subtracted 200 it's it's around um it's
 
03:18:28.030 --> 03:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
around 3 I think the number for fiscal
 
03:18:30.349 --> 03:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
year 23 I believe it's 3.8 billion and
 
03:18:31.870 --> 03:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
we have about 400 million in federal
 
03:18:33.630 --> 03:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
revenue so I think it's around 3.4
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
billion so a little bit more than 3.2
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you just a quick uh every
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
time that ADM is referenced it's an R
 
03:18:46.030 --> 03:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
not an a uh yes thanks for this formula
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
yes so we we have that um Universal
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
based cost times the weights and we get
 
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
that number which totals up Statewide to
 
03:18:53.640 --> 03:18:55.030 align:start position:0%
that number which totals up Statewide to
3.2

03:18:55.030 --> 03:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
3.2
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
billion the next column column W is
 
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's two things that are applied to
 
03:19:04.990 --> 03:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
that number in 1586 um it's one of them
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
is called an efficiency Factor so it it
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's that immediately applies a 95%
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
number to it so it takes 5% out of it
 
03:19:15.670 --> 03:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
um and then there's something called a
 
03:19:18.510 --> 03:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
transition percentage phase in and so as
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I discussed he
 
03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to see what the numbers looked
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
like with that at 80% as introduced it's
 
03:19:28.990 --> 03:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
at 70% so when you take 95% off that 3.2
 
03:19:31.389 --> 03:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
billion or sorry 5% off it and then you
 
03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
take 20% off it you get a number that's
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
smaller than 3.2 billion you get 2.4
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
billion and so um that transition phase
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
in or transition percentage
 
03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
as uh described in the concept of 1586
 
03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be 80% one year and then the
 
03:19:52.349 --> 03:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
next year it's going to grow and then
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
grow and then grow until you have 100%
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
which would actually only be 95% because
 
03:19:59.070 --> 03:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
of the efficiency Factor um but that is
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
how uh 1586 1586 is const constructed so
 
03:20:04.590 --> 03:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
that you would slowly phase into the
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
full 3.2
 
03:20:10.830 --> 03:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
billion so that is the weight side if
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
everyone is okay we can move on to the
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.389 --> 03:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
money so we'll we'll stay in the world
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
of aworth uh for now just because it's
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
the easy one to uh at the top of the
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
line but um I did highlight Allenstown
 
03:20:30.429 --> 03:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
and Alton because I kind of wanted to
 
03:20:33.189 --> 03:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
walk through those two scenarios of um
 
03:20:34.590 --> 03:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh a school district that's going to
 
03:20:37.870 --> 03:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
receive more money through this uh uh
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
Bill and then um a school school
 
03:20:41.710 --> 03:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
district that's going to not receive
 
03:20:45.189 --> 03:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
money money uh through this bill
 
03:20:49.389 --> 03:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
um so column W is just that's the what
 
03:20:50.830 --> 03:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
the last column we just ended on that
 
03:20:54.990 --> 03:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
2.4 billion Statewide that is the um
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget with the
 
03:20:59.790 --> 03:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
95% efficiency Factor applied and the
 
03:21:02.830 --> 03:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
80% transition percentage phase in
 
03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
applied um so for aworth this is
 
03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
essentially what the concept of their
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget um The
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
Benchmark that aworth needs to have a
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget as defined
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill is 1.48 5 million so that's
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
the Benchmark similar to the cost of
 
03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate education that is The
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
Benchmark that needs to be achieved um
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh in in this bill but before the state
 
03:21:33.070 --> 03:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
cuts them a check for 1.5 million uh it
 
03:21:34.750 --> 03:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
is going to look at what their minimum
 
03:21:38.189 --> 03:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
local contribution is and so in column X
 
03:21:40.429 --> 03:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
we have the equalized valuation that is
 
03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
the property values um including
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
utilities that's
 
03:21:47.389 --> 03:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
equalized um so we are going to apply uh
 
03:21:48.870 --> 03:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
um a
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
$425 per thousand tax rate to that
 
03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
number so for aworth they have $164
 
03:21:58.590 --> 03:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
million in property value on an
 
03:21:58.600 --> 03:21:59.750 align:start position:0%
million in property value on an
equalized

03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
equalized
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
basis if we apply a $425 tax rate to
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
that or other also known as 43 uh 43% of
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
their property or percentage um that
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
raises 600
 
03:22:16.590 --> 03:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
97,000 so to achieve their Foundation
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget which is 1. 485
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
million they're going to do a minimum
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
contribution of 697
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
th000 so that is their minimum
 
03:22:32.030 --> 03:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
contribution uh uh in column Z there
 
03:22:36.750 --> 03:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a lesser less of the two uh
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh column that I had in there um so 6
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
697 is the lesser of of the two it's
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
less it's um less than their Foundation
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget um so their state
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Grant is going to be
 
03:22:53.070 --> 03:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the difference is between their
 
03:22:55.469 --> 03:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution and the foundation
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget so they need
 
03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
$787,000 plus their minimum contribution
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
to get them up to the 1.48 five million
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
so their state Opportunity Grant um in
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
1586 is going to be 787 th000
 
03:23:15.389 --> 03:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
um that's the core mechanics of the bill
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
but there's more that goes on there's a
 
03:23:21.550 --> 03:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
transition Grant Mark Mr chair yeah so
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
so the the three columns that Mark just
 
03:23:25.950 --> 03:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
U just highlighted are probably the most
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
important ones in here it's column W
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
which is the foundation opportunity
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
budget which was that all those weight
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
calculations that that come up with that
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then the um the minimum local
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
contribution in Z which is the first
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
dollars toward WS that Foundation
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget so rather than State
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
dollars being the first dollars towards
 
03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
the budget it's local dollars which are
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
the first dollars to the budget and then
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
column AA which is the state Opportunity
 
03:23:58.670 --> 03:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
Grant that get you using State money to
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
hit if you haven't been able to hit your
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget with your
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
local money then the state comes in and
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's um that's column AA thank you
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for walking through that
 
03:24:13.070 --> 03:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so yeah as we are with column AA the
 
03:24:15.790 --> 03:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
state Opportunity Grant um there's also
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
a hold harmless provision and I'm going
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
to go down one row to Albany because for
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
Albany a hold harmless comes into play
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
and so Albany the state Opportunity
 
03:24:27.750 --> 03:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
Grant is expected to be
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
$468,000 in in sort of State cash a
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
check from the state um because their
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution is 814k and their
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is 1.3 million so um
 
03:24:39.550 --> 03:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
right now at this moment in the formula
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
they're expected to get 468k
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
um in a funding from the
 
03:24:47.710 --> 03:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
state but if we look at their fiscal
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
year 25 total education grant um that
 
03:24:53.469 --> 03:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
includes the hold harmless formula
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's in current law but does not
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
include swept the state cash they
 
03:24:59.710 --> 03:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
received was
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
521k and so um they are held harmless
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
and so in order to hold them harmless
 
03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
the next column over is the 53k they
 
03:25:08.520 --> 03:25:09.309 align:start position:0%
the next column over is the 53k they
need

03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
$53,000 added to that 4 60 AK to bring
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
them up to what they were receiving
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
under current law and so um the way
 
03:25:19.630 --> 03:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
these metrics were applied um the
 
03:25:21.710 --> 03:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
transition Grant is is actually a pretty
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
small dollar amount um it's six around
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
$7 million Statewide um so very few
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
communities need that transition Grant
 
03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
um for the factors added into here um
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
but Albany appears to be one of
 
03:25:37.269 --> 03:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
them um but yeah most communities are
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
not uh receiving that transition
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
Grant uh so moving forward um their new
 
03:25:45.950 --> 03:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
state grant that does not include swept
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get to swept in a
 
03:25:49.349 --> 03:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
second um it's their Opportunity Grant
 
03:25:51.389 --> 03:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
and their transition grant that is going
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
to be 1.2 uh billion
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide um where things get a little
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
technical is we need to compare this if
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to compare 1586 to current law
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
I need to factor in swept so in
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
1586 um
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
swept the dollar amount the amount
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
raised stays uh what it is under current
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
law it's
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
363 um or whatever it takes to get to
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
363 million it's 364 million um for
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 um so it's the 364
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
million um right there
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
except 3% of it is going to retain
 
03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
locally under 1586 um so that can go
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
straight from the tax collector actually
 
03:26:39.670 --> 03:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
stays with the tax collector stays with
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality is my understanding
 
03:26:44.429 --> 03:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
um and 97% of it is going to be remitted
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
to the state so um just to go through
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
aworth acworth's total swept is
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
$194,000 they are going to keep
 
03:26:57.710 --> 03:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
$5,800 and then I don't have a
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
calculator in front of me but um uh the
 
03:27:02.670 --> 03:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
rest of it approximately 189,000 is
 
03:27:04.830 --> 03:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
going to go remitted to the
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
state um so in order to and I could have
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
probably been a little bit better with
 
03:27:11.870 --> 03:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
my descriptions here
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
but column AG is telling you what 1586
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
does for your community um as proposed
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
and as discussed with the representative
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
luno um for aworth it's
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
793 th000 and the reason why it's higher
 
03:27:31.189 --> 03:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
than that 787 th000 that we calculated
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
back in column ad uh is because I'm
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
adding the amount to they get to R keep
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
and retain under
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
1586 um uh and it's $5,000 for $5,800
 
03:27:43.950 --> 03:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
plus the
 
03:27:47.189 --> 03:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
$787 gets the total amount that aworth
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
is essentially keeping so that's 793
 
03:27:58.030 --> 03:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
th000 um that is the AG column for
 
03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
aworth um under current law they receive
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
682k um and that includes swept because
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
all of swep in under current law is
 
03:28:09.070 --> 03:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
retained locally so they receive every
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
swept dollar um they raise under 1586
 
03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
they only received 133% so um um just so
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get into the Alton is
 
03:28:19.550 --> 03:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to help explain the difference
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
between how sweps going to work under
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
this new bill uh under this uh proposed
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
682 um is what they received for swept
 
03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
and adequacy grants under under current
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
law and so what the difference is is
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
under 1586 and all these metrics put in
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
there um aworth would receive a addition
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
additional funding of
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
110k um so that's how it works for
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
aworth and
 
03:28:47.510 --> 03:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go through the Allen's
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
how are we doing a time we got 30
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to go through the
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
Allenstown example and the AL Alton
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
example and that's going to help explain
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more of how this funding
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
is working um I think uh representative
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
America had a question about um where is
 
03:29:02.990 --> 03:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
this money coming from so this proposal
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
as in front of you 200 mil 2011 million
 
03:29:09.550 --> 03:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
is um above and beyond what you
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
currently are paying in education so
 
03:29:14.349 --> 03:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
that would require a funding source that
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
is not well as proposed in here that
 
03:29:18.110 --> 03:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
would essentially require education
 
03:29:19.870 --> 03:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund dollars however you may get
 
03:29:19.880 --> 03:29:22.630 align:start position:0%
trust fund dollars however you may get
them

03:29:22.630 --> 03:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:29:27.630 --> 03:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah so so in part um under this
 
03:29:29.950 --> 03:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
proposal um 200 million would need to be
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
funded through some Source not already
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
identified in The
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
Proposal um I'm going to explain how
 
03:29:39.990 --> 03:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
some of the swept dollars is going to
 
03:29:43.229 --> 03:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
help uh uh support this bill as proposed
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
1586 and I think the example for that is
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
Alton um so Allenstown and I highlighted
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and Alton so we're going to
 
03:29:52.189 --> 03:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to switch between the two
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
Allenstown is a community that's
 
03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
receiving more money Alton is a
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
community that is going to receive less
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
money under this proposal so for
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
Alton uh their proposed budget is their
 
03:30:06.189 --> 03:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget is around
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
um they're pretty similar actually um
 
03:30:13.229 --> 03:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
8.4 million and for Alton it's 8 7
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
million so that's the Benchmark that
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be hit um under
 
03:30:20.229 --> 03:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
1586 then we look at their property
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
values so Allenstown has um 53 31
 
03:30:27.189 --> 03:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
million as a property tax base so when
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
you apply the
 
03:30:31.870 --> 03:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
$425 tax to that tax base it brings in
 
03:30:31.880 --> 03:30:33.830 align:start position:0%
$425 tax to that tax base it brings in
$2.2

03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
$2.2
 
03:30:37.630 --> 03:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
million um $2.2 million does not take
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
them all the way to the 8.4 million so
 
03:30:43.389 --> 03:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
if you skip over to column W uh
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
daa um uh they need a state check of 6.2
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
million to bring them up to the 8.4
 
03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
million so that's how it's going to work
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
for Allenstown uh in 1586 for Alton
 
03:30:59.950 --> 03:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
their Benchmark they're kind of the
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
newly defined cost of in adequate
 
03:31:03.469 --> 03:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
education essentially um the foundation
 
03:31:05.309 --> 03:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is 8.7
 
03:31:08.349 --> 03:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
million their property values are 3.5
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
billion so the $425 rate applied to that
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
tax uh base brings in $15 million almost
 
03:31:22.269 --> 03:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
so um Alton has a minimum contribution
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
that exceeds the foundation opportunity
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
budget so their minimum contribution um
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh essentially is it only needs to be
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
8.7 million to hit the foundation
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget um so they don't need
 
03:31:38.670 --> 03:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
to raise as much um uh as the as the as
 
03:31:41.630 --> 03:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
the 4.2 4.25 number
 
03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
so their state check is $0 because their
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution covers um the
 
03:31:49.710 --> 03:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget so Al
 
03:31:53.830 --> 03:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
Alton will receive um uh 0 Allenstown
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
would receive $6.2 million um so that's
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
how that's working now I'm going to jump
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
back to that swept column um if you can
 
03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
look at column AA and you can look at um
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and
 
03:32:12.910 --> 03:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
Alton um under current law Allenstown
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
swept is
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
636k and they retain all of that funding
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
um under current law Alton swept is 4.2
 
03:32:23.429 --> 03:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
million and they retain all of that
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
funding um but under 1586 what would
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
happen is Allenstown would keep $19,000
 
03:32:32.910 --> 03:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
of that swept which is 3% and Alton
 
03:32:35.150 --> 03:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
would keep
 
03:32:38.590 --> 03:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
127,000 so essentially I don't have the
 
03:32:41.710 --> 03:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
math here but um um
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know 4.1 million uh in swept from
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
Alton would be going to the state um so
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
the way that's working out mechanically
 
03:32:52.670 --> 03:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
is under
 
03:32:56.670 --> 03:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
1586 they are Alton is receiving 127k in
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
retained uh retained swept um but under
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
current law they keep their entire swept
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
so the way that's working out is that um
 
03:33:09.309 --> 03:33:09.319 align:start position:0%
under current law 1586 as proposed
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
compared to current law they are having
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
a decrease in school funding by 4.1
 
03:33:16.990 --> 03:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
million so to describe how it's being
 
03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:18.229 align:start position:0%
million so to describe how it's being
paid

03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
paid
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
for 200 million would need to come from
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
a re Revenue Source not identified in
 
03:33:25.469 --> 03:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
1586 but
 
03:33:25.479 --> 03:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
1586 but
essentially

03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:33:31.870 --> 03:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
97% of swept is is going or going to the
 
03:33:34.670 --> 03:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
state and so for um some of that funding
 
03:33:36.750 --> 03:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
is also coming from a town like Alton in
 
03:33:40.150 --> 03:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
a sense that um they're receiving 4.1
 
03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
million less State funding because the
 
03:33:45.309 --> 03:33:45.319 align:start position:0%
swept is remitted to the state so that's
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
also one of the funding source that's
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
how swept works as a funding source in
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
1586 because um swept is now going to
 
03:33:53.550 --> 03:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
the state which means you're not uh
 
03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
guaranteed all of it you're only
 
03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed um you're only guaranteed the
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
variance between your opportunity budget
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
and your minimum contribution which for
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
Alton is 0 so that's and you're
 
03:34:11.150 --> 03:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
guaranteed the 3% swept retain so I
 
03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if I did a good job
 
03:34:14.070 --> 03:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
explaining that it's a little tricky um
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
if we need to go through that again uh
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
um let me know or if there's any
 
03:34:24.389 --> 03:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
that so MB sends back $7
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
million M bro yep we can uh yeah sorry
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
03:34:34.239 --> 03:34:35.790 align:start position:0%
this is not
uh

03:34:35.790 --> 03:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:38.830 --> 03:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
so so on on that Rick and
 
03:34:41.469 --> 03:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
and if I can just use the alt one since
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
it's highlighted and right on the is
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
outside as mka no no no yeah similar
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
type of thing but but but at the same
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
time they don't need to be kicking in
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
the whole four and a quarter to meet
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
$425 to meet their Foundation
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and similar to in
 
03:35:01.630 --> 03:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
Alton Alton can probably get to their
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget with about
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
$3 and um and then yeah they're losing
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
the swept and that's a122 so that gets
 
03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
them to about 4 and a quarter which is
 
03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
still less than most towns like or
 
03:35:18.750 --> 03:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
cities like conquered or hopkington are
 
03:35:20.670 --> 03:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
going to be paying in combination
 
03:35:21.550 --> 03:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
between the
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
$425 local contribution minimum
 
03:35:28.189 --> 03:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
contribution and the uh the122 uh State
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
Property Tax so so the the the whole
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
idea here though is rather than towns
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
some towns spending 15 20 $25 per
 
03:35:40.229 --> 03:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
thousand to meet their um their local
 
03:35:44.349 --> 03:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
school budgets uh in in in in this in
 
03:35:48.189 --> 03:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
the the um the the plan here and
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
obviously these are a lot of dials that
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
can be can be turned um
 
03:35:54.910 --> 03:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
$425 plus
 
03:35:58.349 --> 03:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
a122 essentially constitutes the um the
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
municipality

03:36:18.750 --> 03:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
so sure I heard that correctly the
 
03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
maximum would be five plus 1.22 ma the
 
03:36:27.790 --> 03:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
um the the combination of the local
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
minimum the
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
$425 plus a122 would be the most that
 
03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
you have to put towards um sure and the
 
03:36:40.990 --> 03:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
1.22 is a given and the five is a cap uh
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
well it's not a five it's the
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
4.25 and and the and this is one of the
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
things I think we need to to definitely
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
work out in the study is rather than
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
having a a fixed dollar amount have that
 
03:36:57.070 --> 03:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
float based on fiscal policy on what the
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
state share should be and uh because
 
03:37:01.349 --> 03:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
when when we have such dramatic
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
increases in property valuations as we
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
have over the last three years Statewide
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
property valuations went from 220
 
03:37:12.510 --> 03:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
billion to 340 billion that all of a
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
sudden a $5 per thousand is way you know
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
way out of out of whack so so we'd want
 
03:37:23.550 --> 03:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
to probably most likely float that rate
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
um onto onto what the um the state
 
03:37:30.030 --> 03:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
obligation would be from a fiscal policy
 
03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
sto just to clarify uh uh uh the
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
for for the the
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
$425 is it's a minimum contribution so
 
03:37:46.269 --> 03:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's how much money um it's your
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution to hit the
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget some
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
communities might want to go uh above
 
03:37:53.070 --> 03:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
and beyond the foundation opportunity
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
budget and therefore they would have to
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
raise more than $4 20 uh they depends on
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
the community um depends on how much
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
State money you receive um but some
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
communities might have to have a tax
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
higher than $425 cents if they want to
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
go above and beyond the foundation
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and there's no other
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source available that's entirely
 
03:38:14.030 --> 03:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
based on local decisions that's not
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
based but it's but it's local decisions
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
that for many towns aren't made in the
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
town they're made in the Regional School
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
District subject
 
03:38:26.349 --> 03:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
to your Cooperative would be um
 
03:38:27.510 --> 03:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative is a different yeah it's all
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
based on how the Cooperative would flow
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
through and how it impact taxes that's
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
right um another thing uh just to
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
understand um representative Luna was
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
talking about where to Peg a doll where
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
to Peg the um uh minimum contribution
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
rate um how to get it to float um uh
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
probably some more work uh the study
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee that's a a good suggestion for
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
the study committee to look at um just
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
so you guys have a little context about
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh some of the variables that
 
03:38:53.550 --> 03:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I uh were
 
03:38:53.560 --> 03:38:54.710 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I uh were
discussing

03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
03:38:57.070 --> 03:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
was minimum contribution whatever you
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
said that to is going to obviously
 
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
impact this formula greatly so um you
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
could run scenarios I ran just a couple
 
03:39:06.429 --> 03:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
scenarios for representative luno um you
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
could set it at $3 if you set it at $3
 
03:39:11.670 --> 03:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's a low lower minimum contribution
 
03:39:13.150 --> 03:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
which means the state needs to spend
 
03:39:15.070 --> 03:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
more money um you could set it a higher
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
number so if you sent it at $5 then the
 
03:39:18.910 --> 03:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
state needs to pay less money um so
 
03:39:21.790 --> 03:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's one dial you can uh uh move
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
around and and see you know how much
 
03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
money you have or uh how much money you
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
can spend um that's going to impact the
 
03:39:30.349 --> 03:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
total State spend um and that's going to
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
impact this formula um the other uh
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
metric that representative Luna and I
 
03:39:36.269 --> 03:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
were moving around with um is the
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
percentage transition phase in um like I
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
said it was 70% as int roduced about 80%
 
03:39:44.189 --> 03:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
in this proposal um the higher you make
 
03:39:46.670 --> 03:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
that percentage the more you phase in
 
03:39:48.189 --> 03:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
the more the higher the opportunity
 
03:39:49.990 --> 03:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
budget means which potentially means the
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
more State money that needs to go out
 
03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
for districts to hit that or for
 
03:39:54.910 --> 03:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities to hit that Benchmark um
 
03:39:57.389 --> 03:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
so that's one factor um that could
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
change the the the price tag and the
 
03:40:02.030 --> 03:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
distribution here um was that the two
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
main those are the two main factors I
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
think we looked at um I I I think you're
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
right Mark and and and I I think the the
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
um scenario that Mark has put together
 
03:40:16.189 --> 03:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
here uh is is really it's not to it's
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
not to settle on um what the local
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution is or anything like
 
03:40:24.030 --> 03:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
that but it's really to to Really sort
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
of illustrate how how a different um
 
03:40:31.349 --> 03:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
costing and funding structure with
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
similar amounts of State dollars so I
 
03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
know this is 200 million more than than
 
03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
the current um um State funding but but
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
the other two scenarios that we we're
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
taking a look at are 800 million more
 
03:40:46.269 --> 03:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
and then another 600 million more than
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
that so $ 1.4 billion more and and you
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
can see what this does for the the most
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
some of the most um economically
 
03:40:59.349 --> 03:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
challenged communities around our state
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
or or or challenged with um with with
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
with with with different um um
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh situations in their in their District
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
such as Manchester such as Rochester
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
such as Claremont and Berlin and um and
 
03:41:17.550 --> 03:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
so so it's really here to illustrate we
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
could we could go we could
 
03:41:23.229 --> 03:41:23.239 align:start position:0%
make adjustments to the current model in
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
the tune of $1.4 billion and see that it
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that much for Berlin or
 
03:41:30.309 --> 03:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
Claremont or Manchester or make
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
adjustments more in the 200 million or
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
maybe even less and see what that does
 
03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
for for Berlin Claremont Manchester and
 
03:41:39.520 --> 03:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
for for Berlin Claremont Manchester and
others

03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
thanks yes ripson
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
Ames I think it's important to keep in
 
03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
mind that this is a a spreadsheet that
 
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
shows uh getting to
 
03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
70% of the
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
um opportunity budget not
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
100% And
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
um 80% sorry it it uh it's 80% of what
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
is going to cost and um cost and then
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
contributions vary but uh there's a big
 
03:42:21.189 --> 03:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
difference there and I think it's going
 
03:42:24.750 --> 03:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
to be important at some point soon to
 
03:42:29.469 --> 03:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
see where we're going to get to at
 
03:42:32.149 --> 03:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
100% uh it's a big difference and we
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
need to know uh the good and the bad and
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
hard of all
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
that are there any projections that you
 
03:42:43.469 --> 03:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned 21 million right now right
 
03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
what are you projecting five years
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
hence so five years hence it would go up
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
100% it depends on how the yeah it
 
03:43:07.830 --> 03:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
depends on the variable so um if you do
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
80% up to 100%
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
and you assume zero growth in property
 
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
value then I I have to number run the
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
numbers to just know it's a lot so but
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you it depends on how it depend on
 
03:43:20.560 --> 03:43:21.269 align:start position:0%
if you it depends on how it depend on
how

03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:43:25.309 --> 03:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
you in theory if the foundation
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity phas in grows at the same
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
rate as property values then the overall
 
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
net uh cost to the state would be kind
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
of neutral because for every dollar
 
03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're growing you're also growing the
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution and those would
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
wash each other out now it's going to
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
get obviously messy with a spreadsheet
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
town by Town um because not every
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
property growth is not uniformly growing
 
03:43:46.269 --> 03:43:46.279 align:start position:0%
everywhere but generally if that's
 
03:43:47.550 --> 03:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
generally the average of What would
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
happening it would wash it out to some
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
extent um but that's all depends on how
 
03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:52.750 align:start position:0%
extent um but that's all depends on how
you

03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
design how you Peg the minimum
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
contribution and then how you phase in
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
um uh how you phase in the foundation
 
03:44:02.590 --> 03:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget but you could
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
probably design a model that
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
approximately washes out um I don't know
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can do that but you
 
03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
could study it and see if you can see if
 
03:44:14.110 --> 03:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
you can build that model um I think it's
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's doable if you study
 
03:44:18.750 --> 03:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
it um but you would be assuming property
 
03:44:19.950 --> 03:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
you're making assumptions about property
 
03:44:21.790 --> 03:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
growth which is very hard to do and I
 
03:44:23.349 --> 03:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
don't like doing that
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
so and and and I and I think that's one
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
of the most challenging things about our
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
current form current formula and and
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
this one too is property valuation and I
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
think Manchester is another good example
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
here which is a year ago during the
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
budget process we had uh predicted we we
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
had expected that Manchester was going
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
to receive and I don't remember the
 
03:44:45.149 --> 03:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
numbers off the top my head in terms of
 
03:44:47.110 --> 03:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant but
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
because of the increase in property
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
valuations that Grant was reduced
 
03:44:54.750 --> 03:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
significantly and uh it was just not
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
something that I think could have been
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
was was predicted back at the time the
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.149 --> 03:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
done there other questions yes go ahead
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
so just quick
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
numbers here I wrote down the
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget for each of the five
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
towns that comprise Fall Mountain School
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
District and they aggregate 21,
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
210,000 so the combination of the
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
minimum and the state
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:40.510 align:start position:0%
 
21.21%

03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
21.21%
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
so this
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
is only
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
60% of what would be required to
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
maintain current spending so that extra
 
03:45:54.630 --> 03:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
40% is effectively what the the five
 
03:45:56.149 --> 03:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
towns would have to come together and
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
decide whether to further charge the
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
property tax right back to what we said
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other day the property tax in this
 
03:46:07.149 --> 03:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
formula is bearing three layers the
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
minimum the swept in the increment and
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
high right and and um and so so there's
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of things on that uh we started
 
03:46:26.229 --> 03:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
with 80% not 100% so that would
 
03:46:28.750 --> 03:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
obviously get it get it um much closer
 
03:46:32.670 --> 03:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to to current get it from 80 to 95
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
did I understand yeah 80 to 95 99 that's
 
03:46:39.149 --> 03:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
the the efficiency reduction and uh and
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
those things could be modeled um uh
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
along with looking at um the um the the
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
local minimum contribution could be uh
 
03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
could be modeled up a little bit to try
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
to keep the uh the state share at I I
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
think what were we aiming at dick a a
 
03:46:55.920 --> 03:46:57.510 align:start position:0%
think what were we aiming at dick a a
42%

03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
42%
 
03:47:02.149 --> 03:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal um policy for the state share and
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh but I you know I I think
 
03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
Mark this this hopefully gives us a lot
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
think about um certainly Visa V some of
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
the other bills that have that have
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
looked at at um at changes too and and
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
um and what do how how can State money
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
be used best to move the needle to
 
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
really you know be directed towards
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
towards the communities that need it
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
most and so I I I hear what you're
 
03:47:34.229 --> 03:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
saying I don't
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
think this is not being suggested as a
 
03:47:38.870 --> 03:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
landing uh place it's being suggested as
 
03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
a as a a spot to start a
 
03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
discussion well I think it's extremely
 
03:47:48.870 --> 03:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
interesting I'm still absorbing a lot
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to go back you know look
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
at the equalized value and just make a u
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
a quick estimate for what I think that
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
would involve to maintain current
 
03:47:59.229 --> 03:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
funding and I can tell you next
 
03:47:59.239 --> 03:48:01.269 align:start position:0%
funding and I can tell you next
Friday

03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
03:48:04.510 --> 03:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
um hopkington has the honor of having
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
the highest mill rate currently in the
 
03:48:09.870 --> 03:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
state and charlestown's number two so we
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
are compatriots here
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know we're everything is
 
03:48:24.510 --> 03:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
so skewed in terms of uh property
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
valuations one of the things I'm trying
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
to figure out is where the house bill
 
03:48:30.479 --> 03:48:31.389 align:start position:0%
to figure out is where the house bill
this

03:48:31.389 --> 03:48:31.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:48:34.189 --> 03:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
spring included fiscal capacity
 
03:48:38.349 --> 03:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and the ultimate hb2
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
Senate version didn't
 
03:48:43.630 --> 03:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
it uh it made a dramatic difference for
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
property poor
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
towns so I'm going to be looking at
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
1586 and asking how does that compare to
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
the combination of fiscal capacity
 
03:48:59.349 --> 03:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
disparity aid augmenting adequacy aid
 
03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
which you know because I think that's
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
still an option when we'd have to
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
persuade the Senate to go along right
 
03:49:07.870 --> 03:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
but but the way that the funding came
 
03:49:11.189 --> 03:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
out of uh the house this spring I
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
thought at least from the perspective of
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
my constituents was a a very good
 
03:49:17.870 --> 03:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
arrangement I'm not sure yet how this
 
03:49:19.630 --> 03:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
compares to that
 
03:49:21.550 --> 03:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
combination definitely better than
 
03:49:25.110 --> 03:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid by itself but the formula
 
03:49:27.309 --> 03:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
here it takes a lot into account in
 
03:49:30.149 --> 03:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
terms of you know special needs free and
 
03:49:33.030 --> 03:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
reduced it's reading level uh it takes a
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
lot into account in terms of a school
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
size um it doesn't take a lot into
 
03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
size um it doesn't take a lot into
account

03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:49:42.149 --> 03:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of adjusting for equalized
 
03:49:44.990 --> 03:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
valuation and property poor communities
 
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
so that component I think is
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
deemphasized here and they're of course
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
they're all competing with each other I
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
get it but yeah yeah with with the with
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
the exception that that you know I'd say
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
a couple things I I and I agree with you
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal capacity disparity Aid and
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
that was really I think the only way
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
that we could approach that given our
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
current um the the the funding formula
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we've got to work with because this
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
one us uses the local minimum
 
03:50:13.070 --> 03:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
contribution as the first thing that's
 
03:50:15.550 --> 03:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
essentially a fiscal capacity disparity
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
because you're you're carving into your
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
foundation to a degree to a degree to a
 
03:50:22.590 --> 03:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
degree um but but one of the things that
 
03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
that you won't find on this although
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've got a little bit of it uh for the
 
03:50:29.550 --> 03:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
the tax transition grants is there's no
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
hold harmless there's no stabilization
 
03:50:33.630 --> 03:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
there's no right hand side of the
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
formula the whole idea is that this is a
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
Formula that that is designed to to um
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
to work maybe not with the numbers the
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
way the way the dials are turned right
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
now but um but it's it's essentially
 
03:50:50.910 --> 03:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
designed to be to to to be fair funding
 
03:50:53.229 --> 03:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
for all of our school
 
03:50:55.870 --> 03:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
districts well that when we when you
 
03:50:57.870 --> 03:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
look at that previous formula when I
 
03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
keep hearkening back too that 2008
 
03:51:03.870 --> 03:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
version we did have fiscal capacity
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid built upon those several
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
conditions and we also had within the
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which is a part of
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy the builtin f&amp;r
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
allocations uh which which were even
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
double for her District uh in terms of a
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
double of the base and through that
 
03:51:30.670 --> 03:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
means I think that formula is able to
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be able to see how that
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
original formula would look in terms of
 
03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
today yeah that's that's worth doing and
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
and and and do this
 
03:51:45.550 --> 03:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
comparison um I I just the fiscal
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid you talk about is
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
extremely important for those poorer
 
03:51:52.670 --> 03:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
communities and and that's why we worked
 
03:51:55.469 --> 03:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
for 1680 to get that in there and we did
 
03:51:57.670 --> 03:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the house but you know we got messed
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
around with on the other side of the
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
wall and and so
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well i' like to cander I voted
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
against hb2 because of fact that there
 
03:52:10.189 --> 03:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
was no of conference and that was
 
03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
dropped down there may have been some
 
03:52:16.990 --> 03:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
one so somewhere along the way would it
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
t would it be a real huge job to put
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
together a spreadsheet dealing with the
 
03:52:24.920 --> 03:52:26.870 align:start position:0%
together a spreadsheet dealing with the
old

03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
old
 
03:52:29.349 --> 03:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
formula it would take me to some not
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
algen I'm talking about esterbrook yeah
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
2008 um I'd have to go through
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's old spreadsheets
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
I believe um so I'd have to see hold on
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
a sec this representative fellos and I
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
had a little discussion before lunch she
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
left a whole book over there regarding
 
03:52:48.189 --> 03:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
the old formula somewhere on Pleasant
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
Street um yeah I I haven't studied the
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh well um if it's Pleasant Street we
 
03:52:54.910 --> 03:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
moved it hopefully they didn't throw it
 
03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
away they they hopefully got moved to 25
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
Hall Street um yeah have to it' be a
 
03:53:01.750 --> 03:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
matter of uh me studying the old
 
03:53:04.429 --> 03:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
formulas and seeing if I can modernize
 
03:53:09.149 --> 03:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
it um um but that yeah I mean I I I can
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
running a fisical capacity disparity Aid
 
03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
formula um as I currently understand it
 
03:53:15.269 --> 03:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
which was enacted in 2021 for a onetime
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh Aid amount um uh doesn't seem
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem that challenging um unless
 
03:53:24.269 --> 03:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
there's a a a anomaly or quirkiness to
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
the 2008 Formula um I think the major
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
changes is the data sets um there was a
 
03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
two-year lag on the data um but I mean I
 
03:53:34.110 --> 03:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
could run analysis on fiscal capacity
 
03:53:36.790 --> 03:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
disparity a I can run analysis on um I
 
03:53:38.349 --> 03:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
think the old formula might have had
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal clip I'm not sure if it did it
 
03:53:43.149 --> 03:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
did and that would we certainly want to
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
change that those Cliffs were horrible
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
when you were dropping down to the next
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
cortile or
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
next you
 
03:53:54.389 --> 03:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
that well that that was exactly right we
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
did reference that or do that in 2021 uh
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
state law had the fnr percentage uh
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
without fiscal cliffs it had fiscal
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid with no fiscal
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
cliffs so you've enacted uh those
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
funding Vehicles whether I think what
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
your question is whether basically what
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
is the median evpp of 2008 and did you
 
03:54:25.950 --> 03:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
did you hit that Target in 2021 I mean
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
you I know I was involved in some of
 
03:54:30.910 --> 03:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
that work with the LBA but um basically
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
I think you would you I don't know what
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the the target was or
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
the what it looked like in 2008 I don't
 
03:54:38.710 --> 03:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
know if you hit that median evpp or if
 
03:54:40.830 --> 03:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
you you are below or under under it and
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
how you distributed Aid um but I could
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
do some research into that and see it
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
could be just be a really aggressive
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid I don't
 
03:54:49.469 --> 03:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
know I'd have to look at the data yeah
 
03:54:50.830 --> 03:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
you'd have to look at it because if you
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
fell below the average there's a lot of
 
03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
little qualifiers to receive that Aid in
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
that formula oh oh you're right okay so
 
03:55:00.309 --> 03:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
the old formula had if you are I did it
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
use Employment Security is that there
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
some

03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.160 --> 03:55:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
Yeah medium family income so yeah and
 
03:55:24.149 --> 03:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
then you also use property
 
03:55:26.670 --> 03:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
valuation so that it would be harder I'm
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that data um I don't
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
Census but the title one
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:39.429 align:start position:0%
Census but the title one
data

03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
no okay 10
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
years I've got an old sheet at the house
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
off to look at that with the
 
03:55:49.520 --> 03:55:52.469 align:start position:0%
off to look at that with the
instructions

03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
instructions
 
03:55:54.750 --> 03:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah I've been I've been digging
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
through some old old old files from uh
 
03:55:59.309 --> 03:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
2008 but uh um I could I could I could
 
03:56:00.990 --> 03:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
see what the mechanism was but yeah I
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
believe that's right there was uh if
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
your family income percentage or or
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
poverty percentage is X then these
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
grants aren't applying to you so that's
 
03:56:10.349 --> 03:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
an easy obviously an easy thing to plug
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
into Excel the harder part is does that
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
data still exist is it in a modern
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
format that matches how it was used in
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
2008 um and I'm not familiar with it so
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
I can't really can't really tell you i'
 
03:56:24.189 --> 03:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
have to familiarize myself with it well
 
03:56:25.630 --> 03:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
something we could look at I think it'd
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
be really great to be able to to do some
 
03:56:30.790 --> 03:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
comparison yep I can look into that
 
03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:32.830 align:start position:0%
comparison yep I can look into that
thank

03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
you we're right at four or three minutes
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
of according to that time zone there um
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
any further discussions or questions of
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
Mark if not we want to thank you Mark
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
for coming down this is a lot of work
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate what you put the time
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
in and it's a lot I'm looking at a lot
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
of confusion in front of me and I'll
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
have to go through this thing and and
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
and and study a little bit more but
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much take a few deep
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
breaths deep some breaths yes drink a
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
couple coffee and do it tough stuff for
 
03:57:07.630 --> 03:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon pardon me tough stuff
 
03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
for Friday afternoon absolutely
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely represent yes it is so we
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a meeting schedule for next Friday
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think it should be in the calendar I
 
03:57:18.750 --> 03:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the calendar just came
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
out the other night it's there good for
 
03:57:24.030 --> 03:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock same time uh can we use your
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
room again please and it'll be in this
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
room thank
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
you it's yeah it's well yes they've got
 
03:57:34.269 --> 03:57:34.279 align:start position:0%
it turned on now and it there was
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
something in it like air air something
 
03:57:38.590 --> 03:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
wrong with it and it was blocking it
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
they had to bleed the pipes yeah they
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
had to bleed so so if it's like that put
 
03:57:44.910 --> 03:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
your hand on it then run up and find
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
hey
