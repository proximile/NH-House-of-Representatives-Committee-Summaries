00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for for coming and waiting for
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
us I I apologize for being late um so we
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
just heard from representative Wier say
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
that um there may be some bills related
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
to these sections so let's let's try
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
today to to learn what's here and and uh
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
go through your requests and then but we
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
may not be able to act right now okay
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
very good all right commissioner thank
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
you for coming good afternoon I
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
understand we actually have three
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners here that
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
right uh good afternoon if if I could as
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
an introduction uh I think I did last
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
time but uh I asked uh assistant
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioner crepo Adam kpo to come up
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh since he's been very involved with
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
this and obviously uh you saw last time
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
and are familiar with our chief
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
operating officer Susan Carlson so you
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
have a few
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
handouts uh one is a spreadsheet of the
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
changes uh being requested to House Bill
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
2 uh we were trying to there's a lot in
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that has our name on it as
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know so we were trying to make it
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
more digestible hopefully that works if
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't you can blame Adam uh also
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
um the you know the L the the biggest
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
homework assignment we got last time if
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
you know memory reserves is where can
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
you displace uh General funds with with
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
either new or increased fees uh we have
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
a a spreadsheet also uh that does that
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
and you'll see should you desire to go
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
that way uh we see a uh a change to the
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
general funds of be able to reduce it by
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
five and a half um million dollars by by
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
tweaking some fees also and we're
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk to that certainly so
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's a banum number not an annual
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
number correct I see thank you yes as
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
you're well aware some fees obviously by
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
the time you you go for your session
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
approve them they start to kick in it's
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
really the second second half of the
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
bium and then uh I believe you have
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
which was done earlier uh a Redline
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
version of some of the the requested
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
changes the house bill to and at some
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
point we do also have a requested change
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
to House Bill one regarding with our
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
um uh relationship uh under this bill so
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
so can you give us a big picture of
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening in sections two through
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
five sure you want to do this or yeah
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I brought up for a
 
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
reason so um for the record Adam kpo
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the Department
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services sections two
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
through five they um you you probably
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about in the governor's um
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
speech that they are going to be
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
realigning some of the state agencies to
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh make permitting a little bit quicker
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh they have a 60-day clock that they
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
want to try to get to and this is one of
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
the ways that they're attempting to do
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
that so part of this is hb1 part of this
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
is hb2 I'll I'll talk about both um hb1
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
moves currently four positions from
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
fishing game and it moves uh three three
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
positions from dncr
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
um we are we requested a technical
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
change to hb1 to move the correct
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
positions there was a technical issue
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
there um from dncr and we have one
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
today uh to reduce the number of
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
positions moving over from fishing game
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
from four to three and so um the the
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
idea here is for when developers have a
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
project and they need Dees permits um
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
often times they have to deal with
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
several state agencies including dncr
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
and fishing game currently uh the idea
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
is to consolidate this um to just a
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop for those those types for
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
any developments that need Dees permits
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
um to De to to Dees and
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
so that's that's really what the change
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
is trying to accomplish it was a little
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
bit broader and the initial version of
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
hb2 was going to give us all of the
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
wildlife reviews part of the Technic the
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
the redlined amendment that you have
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
there is an attempt to narrow that a
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
little bit so that it would only be Dees
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
anything that needs a Dees permit would
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
and a do permit would need to come to us
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
for a wildlife review which currently is
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
at fishing game and an
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
nhb um which is natural heritage
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
database it's a it's a tool that looks
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
for threatening endangered species um
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
both plants and animals and so those
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
those folks would be housed at Dees as
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
well under this proposal and so that's
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell what 2 through five
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
sections 2 through five and 6 through 8
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
do um at a very high level so represent
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
M uh thank you m thank you Mr chair and
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in I'm you rattled
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
off a lot of numbers there and things I
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm clear so what
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
the the proposal is to move four
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
positions from dncr to Dees uh four
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
positions from fishing game okay um
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's a technical correction that
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to be providing to only move
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
three because they will still be doing
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
reviews for other state agencies when
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
they when their permits are required
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
there and for federal agencies when they
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
need a a wildlife review um and then the
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
end the net for dncr would be two
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
positions in hb2 we are going to be
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
sorry where would those where would
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
those two positions go from d dncr to us
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
to Dees so you'd get three from fish
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
three from fishing game two from dncr
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
correct and then in hb2 there is a
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
position established as a supervisor
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
position and that will uh manage these
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
these additional positions we're getting
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
from these other agencies and it will be
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a uh we haven't decided on a
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
name yet but a you know an endangered
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
species uh unit within our land
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
resources management which is where Mo
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
most of our are issued out of and so
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
they would be interfacing with our staff
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
obviously they would be our staff if if
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
should this move forward but um they
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to interface every day
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
with our staff to ensure that these
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
these uh the coordination is there to
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
and would that be a new position that
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
supervisory position that would be a new
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
position and now I'm and and
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
so so hb1 assumes or no hp2 right
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
assumes that there'd be these seven POS
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
four position six positions moving and
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
one new position and what you're
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
proposing now is just having three
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
positions move a HB hb1 contemplates two
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
positions from
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
dncr and four positions from fishing
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
game we're providing technical
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
corrections to the committee that's so
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's hb1 yep hb2 separately
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
establishes the supervisor position
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
position it's a new okay that would be a
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
new position um currently these
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
positions don't uh several of them don't
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
have funding in the other agencies the
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
governor's budget proposes to use
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
General funds to pay for those positions
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
in the first part of the bium or uh over
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
the bium and then after this bium is
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
over then it would we're also increasing
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
fees in this proposal and that's further
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
down the list of uh on the spreadsheet
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
but we're increasing Wetlands fees by
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
50% and alteration of terrain fees are
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
going up 100% And I know the governor's
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
office and and us as well have worked
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
with uh the home builders and the
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
associate General Contractors and
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
several other groups to ensure that this
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
was something that they would be able to
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
do um and so we've we've worked with all
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
of those groups and they as long as they
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
get a tangible benefit from this type of
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
move um they they feel okay with with
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
fees increasing in those in in those uh
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
fees permits permit applications
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
so okay all right representative wer did
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
you calculate whether the new fees would
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of all these people they
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
yes they will they will cover the cost
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
um of of those people yes thank you
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
represent R thank you Mr chair um as far
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
as the fees go um they would these fee
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
increases the 50% the 100% would they
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
apply both to let's say individual
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
property owners who might want uh an
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
approve you know to improve their
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
property as well as commercial and
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
Industrial developers and companies so
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
they these would apply to all Wetlands
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
permits and alteration of terrain
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
permits alteration of terrain permits
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
those are typically commercial type
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
developments those are anything over
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
100,000 square ft uh of of impact and uh
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
unless you're in the protected Shoreland
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
then it's 50,000 square feet of impact
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
you know think long driveways and and
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
big developments like that uh Wetlands
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
you you may have some some uh small um
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know homeowners or or or Property
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
Owners but um but yeah it would it would
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
that would have an imp but we're not
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
proposing to increase Shoreland fees
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
which is different than Wetlands fees
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
and so that's so that's the distinction
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
there can I
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
follow um my concern with increasing the
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
fees for individual private homeowners
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
for both Wetlands is that it may or do
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
you think it it might encourage some
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
people to do work off permit because now
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
instead of paying $400 they're going to
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
$600 I I can't speak to the we haven't
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
raised those fees in some time um we'd
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
have to look back to see if compliance
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know if compliance went up you know
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
our compliance actions went up after the
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
last Fe increase I I don't know that
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's an indication that that would
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
happen I don't know if you if you have
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
any additional thoughts on that it's and
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the bill number so I'm
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
gonna actually it's in here right so so
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
we do have there is a correction in here
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
also for clarification house bill to
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
regarding so so usually even in that
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
that happen stance somebody's hiring
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
somebody to do this work right so we've
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
clarified in the in house bill 2 that if
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
if you're a contractor and you knowingly
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
violate this that you're liable also so
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
we think that will help that a lot right
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that I'm a homeowner
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hire a trade to do this and
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
the Tradesman knows I I'm I'm liable if
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
I do what I'm not supposed to do I we
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
think that will help make that not
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
happen to to the extent you're saying
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
right because it's not impossible a
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
homeowner could do some of this
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
themselves but by and large they're
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're Contracting out with people to
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
do this work and we think this would
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
help that a lot okay another followup so
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
with the wetlands permit how many of
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
those that are issued go to like that
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
private homeowner versus how many go to
 
00:38:52.319 --> 00:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
private homeowner versus how many go to
larger

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
so this is Phil trobridge he runs the
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
land resource management Bureau uh he
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
has while he's getting ready here so he
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
he runs the wetlands program Shoreland
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh subsurface which is septic tanks and
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh alteration of terrain are all under
 
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
his bureau and
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
parenthetically should you go forth with
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
the governor's um initiative so with
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
those other positions from fishing game
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
and dncr they would all be housed under
 
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:27.950 align:start position:0%
and dncr they would all be housed under
his

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
his purview
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
okay you want me to repeat the question
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think I understand hello
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
question we have just done an analysis
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
of this and we think about from on the
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
wetlands permits maybe 30% are related
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
to something like housing as opposed to
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
larger other projects so it's not you
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
know most of the you know there's
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
different categories of wetlands permits
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
as you know you know for instance there
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
are Shoreline structure permits and
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are you know construction of
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
houses uh so our best guess is at about
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
50/50 related to projects that are done
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
by an individual home homeowner versus
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of commercial project okay 30%
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
and then um other question um of those
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
30% how many are permit by notification
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
and how relative to the other ones uh so
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah permit by notification um is about
 
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
half of what we do um and then and uh
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
those are for those are for the smaller
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
projects uh and then their for standard
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
permits are the larger ones okay what
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
would what would you consider what would
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
your opinion be if there was a
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system so that private
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners with a singular project low
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
scale would not be subject to the in the
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
50% increase in
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
fee well so I guess one thing I'd add
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
here is that with a permit by
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
notification it's a flat fee it's just
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you're doing you get charged
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
$400 in this case the proposal would go
 
00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:01.710 align:start position:0%
$400 in this case the proposal would go
to

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
$600 for the larger projects it's a flat
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
fee plus an impact fee so already there
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
is a two-tier situation where the larger
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
projects you know depending on the level
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
of impact can be thousands of dollars of
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
fees as opposed to the $400 to $600 so I
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
think already with having the pbn fee
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
structure the way it is um we have that
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
type of two-tier approach um and uh
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
frankly from uh the representative wer
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
asked you know had we done the
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
calculation of do the fees would the
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
fees cover these positions um and you
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
know we would need the increase on all
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
the fees in order to make this work okay
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
does the fee cover do or does the
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
department do any followup on fees to
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that the conditions that were set
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
out in the permit or were
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
complied we do that we rely a lot on on
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
um the public to report to us potential
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
non-compliance in which we investigate
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
we investigate about 300 um complains a
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
year uh to determine whether uh work
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative wer I think there's
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who wanted to talk to you
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we're expecting like neighbors
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
to tell on neighbors that you know that
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
is a way that we've heard that tends to
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
be very effective um we also hope
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
through the online permitting systems
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we're putting into place to be able
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
to get more of our staff in the field as
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
so what is the responsibility or that
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
that F fishing game and dncr have now
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
that they're losing or no longer
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for whatever so currently
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
under our permits we require a the
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
applicant to get a nhb letter from dncr
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
that is basically describing at a high
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
level what they have on the site and and
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
what types of species are on there
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's a plant or an animal or or
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
habitat once they get that information
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
they work with uh the reviewers which is
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
what we're uh assuming
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
to um to come up with recommendations
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
that to mitigate that uh the impact to
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
those species and so that's the same for
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
both fishing game and and dncr and then
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
we incorporate those recommendations
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
into our permits and so the The Hope
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
here is moving them all Under One Roof
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
Is that the coordination will happen
 
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.549 align:start position:0%
Is that the coordination will happen
more

00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
effectively um you know will'll be a
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop so the applicants not
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
having to go to three or more agencies
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
it can it can be more depending on what
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
other types of permits they have but the
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
most common is are these three agencies
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
and we all work together very colle
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
collaboratively but at the end of the
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
day the applicant is responsible for
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
coordinating with all three separate
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
agencies to ensure that they're
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
upholding this their the statutory
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility under the law and so what
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
this is doing is it's consolidating that
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
bringing that re those you know running
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
the running the report the the letter
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
and um doing the reviews and Phil can
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
kind of speak to what some of the
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
nuances of of how we plan to implement
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
this should it pass but uh at a very
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
high level that's that's what these uh
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
agencies do so is it fishing game when
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
the species is an animal and the and
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
dncr when it's a plant or something like
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
that correct I see okay representative
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
eil well I just have so many questions I
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
don't know um I I don't know in what
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
order to ask this but I guess if if I
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
have a concern about this proposal it's
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
to understand the effect of this on dncr
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
and fishing game um because if I've
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
learned anything over the last several
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
years any individual person even if
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
their permits permits they might perform
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
other functions within the agency and if
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
you take an employee from say dncr and
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
put them with
 
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.349 align:start position:0%
put them with
de

00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
de
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
dncr is losing a person that they might
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
be able to use in different ways and I'm
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
interested in your answer but at the
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate time Mr chair I'd be
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
interested to hear from dncr and fishing
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
game directly about what they think
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
about the program So based on my
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
conversations and and the the
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
commissioners of both those agencies are
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
here to to speak to that at the
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate time but my understanding is
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
for dncr the vast majority of what the
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
staff do uh involve these environmental
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
reviews currently and so we're we're
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
assuming those um
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
and I I would say that there wouldn't be
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
a huge impact to that Agency on the fish
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
and game side the reason why we have the
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
technical changes in hb2 in that Redline
 
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is because there are some
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
staff that do reviews for other state
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
agencies and uh also the federal
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
government when they have permits and
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
things of that things of that nature and
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're proposing to provide
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
one of the four back to uh fishing game
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
because they we realized throughout this
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
process that they do things other than
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
our permits um we when we spoke to them
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
the split is really around 30 7030 or so
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they'll correct me on that
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
number but um just from a high level
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is around what what these POS you
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
know of the four positions around 70% or
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
Dees related
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh reviews and around 30% are other
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
types of reviews and so the we thought
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
the appropriate split was in instead of
 
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
all four you know they keep one of them
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
and then we would retain the other the
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
other three um and this is all in
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
coordination with the governor's office
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
of course so so are the people that
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
moving the people that go out in the
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
field and look for the animals and look
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
for the plants and discover that they're
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
there and that kind of thing or is it
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
that that is not uh their function their
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
function is primarily to do the the
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
reviews uh desktop analysis working with
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
the applicant on uh best best management
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
practices if there are any you know uh
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that they provide
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
for the specific species they coordinate
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the other biologists at their uh
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
Orbot nness at their respective agencies
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
and ensure that they're making the
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate recommendations and so all
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
of that will still occur it's just they
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
they will be Lo the the reviewers
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
themselves who make those and work on
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
those recommendations will be located at
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
Dees representative eil okay so just as
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
a followup to that um the other thing
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
that just really gives me heartburn
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
generally with permitting is that I want
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be sure that there's adequate staff
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
to process a permit request and it
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't simply become sort of a permit
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
by notification because you don't get
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
the permit out the door um in a timely
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
fashion and I I looked really closely at
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
the deadlines here and and I guess I
 
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.109 align:start position:0%
the deadlines here and and I guess I
would

00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
like like to think we would like some um
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
reassurance that the permits that are
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
submitted you've worked this out so that
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
you have adequate time to give it a full
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
and proper review so the 60-day timeline
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
is in this proposal however it's similar
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
to our permits right now where we have a
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
50 day timeline or uh you know in some
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
other cases a shorter timeline there is
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with the
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
applicant if we if we need a Time
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
extension we can do that and if we don't
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
have all of the information to make a
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
decision on a specific application and
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
we run up against that clock because the
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
applicant hasn't provided it then we
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
would we would deny deny the permit just
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
like we do with all of our other types
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
of permits we we obviously make sure
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
that we have all the information and
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
have the proper time to review and vet
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
whatever projects are in front of us
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
before we make it we we issue an
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
approval um and so it's the way it
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
structure is very similar to our other
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
types of permit permitting processes
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity for extensions
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature and I will
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
just comment that oftentimes the reason
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
why I mean you may have heard from some
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
of your constituents sometime every once
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
in a while one of these things do take a
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time and the re
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the reason for that is because
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
the applicant has had a request for
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
information for a significant amount of
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
time and sent it you know they may have
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
it for a few months and then respond to
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
us after a few months after we sent it
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
and so um and and they consider that
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
time that they have the balls in their
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
coure as part of the time that Dees is
 
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and I I think we see that
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
very differently than than applicants um
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's what that is trying to
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
address so right represent well he had
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
one more comment it's I think an
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
important Point too is the governor's
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
initiative with these fee increases you
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
know again we're back to fee for service
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
as we discussed last time provides a
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
stable Revenue source for not only our
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
existing staff but the staff that we
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
would be bringing over to ensure that
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
this type of review can happen properly
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
and you know in the past has been arpa
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
money and you know Etc so that's an
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
important consideration too is that that
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
stable shity of funding also uh to me
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
goes a long way if well I I appreciate
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
the reassurance I just kind of want to
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
hear you guys say it um and then the
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
other thing is um it says that you're
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to change the well there's a
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
permit by notification uh provision now
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
for areas of less than 150,000 square
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
feet so that's a change from the current
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
law which is what a I don't remember I
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
just was curious about that yeah so the
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
current law States it's 100 thou
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
anything over 100,000 square feet
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
requires an alteration of terrain
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
permitting review they need to submit an
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
application and we need to review it and
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
either approve or deny the permit uh
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
what this is proposing to do is create a
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
permit by notification process between
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
100,000 square fet and 150,000 square
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
fet and that's around 15 to 20% of the
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
reviews depending on the year that we
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
get and and the r there's a similar bill
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 110 that is going through
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate currently it we we are
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
proposing to have the language we have a
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
technical correction uh in that Redline
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
packet that that you have that would
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
propose that that be that mirror Senate
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 110 because it has some some better
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
language in there and all basically all
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
this is doing it's giving us rule making
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
ability to create a permit by
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
notification between those two
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
thresholds right so people just have to
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with that extra 50,000
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative R thank
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'm looking at your sheet
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
that you had um for uh potential
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
increases to offset funds uh the
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
response to committee requests for fee
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
increases so we we've talked about fees
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
but what about fines how much revenue
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
does the department generate a year in
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
fines and is there opportunity there to
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
maybe increase fines that um are issued
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
when there are
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
violations I would say most of our fines
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
currently go to the general fund um one
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
of the arguments for that is in the past
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
by especially in the legislature has
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
been they don't want us to set quotas or
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
that have some sort of system like that
 
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.390 align:start position:0%
that have some sort of system like that
that

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
incentivizes um you know go going after
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
people uh for for arbitr you know small
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
violations things that they can't be
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
worked out um obviously we take our
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility very seriously on
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
enforcing the law and ensuring that any
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
violations that occur that we learn
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
about get remediated but that current
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
most fines and fe uh fines currently go
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
in violation uh Revenue go to the go to
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
the general fund how how much is that do
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
um no um um it varies greatly year toe
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
um we set a budget of about $75,000 for
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
fines and it could be um lower than that
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
or it could be several hundred thousand
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
it just depends on what cases get
 
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.670 align:start position:0%
it just depends on what cases get
settled

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
settled
 
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.230 align:start position:0%
settled
when

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay because I
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
mean from my perspective it's okay if it
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund um I'm just
 
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.589 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund um I'm just
wondering

00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
if my my concern is we may be missing a
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
lot of violations um um and that's not
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
just to um have a consequence for people
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
violating their permit but also um that
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
revenue is probably going to could be
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
used for mitigation or other programs
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
damage that was caused by the
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
violation so um that's something I I
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
mean if it there it's just an area I
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
think I mean we look at fines for a
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of other
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
departments uh we look at it you know in
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
the court system or way of defraying
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
costs um um I just think it's an area
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
that in that we need to look at in
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
addition to fees because it is it is a
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
revenue and we should get a handle on
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
the revenue that is um being I guess the
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
Services we don't get right so one of
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
the things that we do do is we often you
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
know settle with with uh violators of
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
whether it's Shoreland or other
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
um other parts of the statue to
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
remediate and and uh maybe have some
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
conser you know put some land in
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
conservation or work with them on other
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
types of consequences as well um and and
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that includes you know
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
paying a fine sometimes that in includes
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
um not paying the fine if they have a
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
substantial um you know if they put some
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
substantial land in preservation or
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
something like that um but I I I hear
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
and and to do uh significant you know
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
significant enforcement I think you know
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
you'd be looking at some more staff too
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
um at that point but I I just throw that
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
out there representative Ms thank you Mr
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking um my question
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
um is there any um redundancy in the um
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
in the in the rsas that you're going to
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
be inheriting from these other agencies
 
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess what I'm getting at is
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
um is there you know I think what we
 
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
would want to avoid is a situation where
 
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're filling out two reports that are
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
essentially similar but that's because
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's specified in the RSA I mean is
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
there are there changes that need to be
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
made in the rsas to allow you to be as
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
possible thank you for the question uh
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
um I think the short answer is no I
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
think we've looked at this pretty
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
carefully and we're we're taking a
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
pretty small piece of the existing
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
rsas that would be needed relative to
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
our permitting programs um but the the
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
rest of the authorities um for
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
implementing the RSA would would reside
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
with the NCR and fishing game you know
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
just not the permitting
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
part I I think also the the the hope for
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
the Governor's initiative uh is to kind
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
of have One-Stop shopping one one uh
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
belly button to push so to speak if I'm
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
rather than having to talk to three
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
agencies per
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
se they they know where to go and then
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
can be the work can be done in that
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
fashion so that that's the hope is is to
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
instead of having multiple it would be
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
one place to go but I I agree with you
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
completely I mean I think that that that
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
should be the goal I guess what I was
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
concerned about was that you know okay
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the applicant is going to one place but
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know after the applicant talks
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that's still having to
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
do three different things send them to
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
three different places that you know
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
maybe he's not necessary and and I don't
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
know maybe it is necessary but uh can
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
you know how do we streamline it to make
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
it easier for your
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
folks I think I think we we really
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
looked at this and you know from from
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
the perspective of streamlining there
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
there really wouldn't be a whole lot of
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
redundancy you know we're let's say we
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
have 20 people that work on this the the
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
way we're looking at this is we're
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
taking you know five of those 20 people
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
and moving them to our agency but it's
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to still be the same 20 people
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
working on it just maybe more efficient
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
for the applicant and on our end to have
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
them at in this physical location of our
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
building to be able to do this work and
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't think there would be any
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
redundancy a lot of this a lot of the
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
same things would happen it would just a
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
lot of it would be streamlined because
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
you'd be talking to one agency instead
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
of three
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
so go ahead all right just one one more
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
followup and it's it's somewhat related
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
um in the in the red line that you gave
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
us um says rule making shall commence
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
within 180 days and I'm not that
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with the rul making process but
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
um is there any reason it can't happen
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
sooner I mean one of the reasons the
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
governor is proposing this is to you
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
know help jump start what we need to do
 
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
in the housing
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
area it it will happen sooner we just
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to give sufficient time to be
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
able to work with stakeholders get as
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
you may be aware um and certainly the
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
members of JL car are are probably
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
painfully aware but it does take a
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time to come up
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
with a concrete proposal that meets the
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
letter of the law and factors in all of
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
the stakeholder input that we want to
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
get for this and ensure that we do it
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
what I'd hate to do is is do it fast and
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
not get not get it right and and I think
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
what what we're proposing here is to
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more more time and I
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
can assure you we're going to move
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
faster than 180 days but we wanted to
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
give ourselves a little bit more time to
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to get to JL car and Factor
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff in um and so that's
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why we're we're
 
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.630 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why we're we're
proposing

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
that so one thing that would help me is
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
give me a a sort of Soup To Nuts example
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
somebody has a piece of rural property
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
and they want to build a building there
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
does do do they call on fishing game to
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
say come out and look around for any
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
endangered animals and they call dncr
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
come out and look around for any
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
endangered plants let me know what's
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
there and then I go to you guys and say
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
I plan to do such and such or how does
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
that work thank thank you for the
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
question so there are quite a few
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
generous land owners Property Owners
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
members of the public that report to
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's the natural heritage database
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not there's a a rare plant
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
on their property or uh threatened or
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
endangered species on their property or
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
anything else like that their habitat um
 
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
there are certainly Folks at fishing
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
game and dncr that go out in the field
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
too to confirm those things um but Soup
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
To Nuts an applicant they have a project
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
that they're proposing uh what we've
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
always encourage folks to do is get
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
their letter from the natural heritage
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
database so that's the reviewers that
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking on looking at the
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
database to see if there are any
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
threatened or endangered plan or animals
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
on or near the property or their
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
habitat from there they work uh with the
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
staff that will be moving to come up
 
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.670 align:start position:0%
staff that will be moving to come up
with

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations and those get
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
incorporated into our permit um but that
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
process can take a significant amount of
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
time depending on the complexity of the
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
species that they're working with so
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
they'll get this letter then they'll
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
have several meetings with fishing game
 
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.990 align:start position:0%
have several meetings with fishing game
um

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
dncr and come up with recommendations
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
that uh need to be incorporated into the
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
permit to ensure that we don't endanger
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh or appreciably jeopardize the uh the
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
continued existence of the species and
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's how the the the law is written
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
and so once that is done we the
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
applicant is then required to come to us
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
for a permit sometimes these things
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
happen concurrently sometimes they don't
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
happen concurrently they come to us for
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
a permit we do our review and then we
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
will incorporate those recommendations
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
into our our permit so it would be a
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
condition as part of our permit and uh
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
Phil lives this day dayto day so I don't
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
know if you have anything you want to
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
add to that but that's from a Soup To
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
Nuts process that's basically how it
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
work sure I think the only thing I would
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
add is um what we ask someone to do when
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
they are applying for a permit and we
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
have these requirements in our in our
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
rules is that they do this uh review or
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
check in the DAT with this natural
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
heritage database and if that check does
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
not uncover any
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
reports of you know threatened
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
endangered species in that vicinity uh
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
they move on there's no further work
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
they need to do on the wildlife side uh
 
01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
and they come to us and we do our
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
permitting um so but if there there is
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
An Occurrence then there's a process by
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
which these people you know these
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
reviewers are taking a look at it and
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
saying is this an old review is this an
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
old report is it a something that that
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
is for example what we call a hit but no
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
impact in which case um we could you
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
know there's really no further work
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's needed uh one of the things that
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do with this program is is
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
identify kind of a high medium and low
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
category during that review because I
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
think it's important for applicants to
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
understand when maybe they're looking at
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
a very sensitive site and then before
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
they get too much invested in it and
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
they understand that it's going to be
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
challenging for permitting um and that's
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
often the challenge for us is someone
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
has in you know gone in two years of
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
planning maybe invested a considerable
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
amount and then they find out that this
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
is a site that's going to be very hard
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
to develop uh so we think some work on
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
the front end here when they're doing
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
this these data Check reviews where they
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
can get an early indication of high
 
01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
medium and low um would really help
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
improve the process so people can do
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
that right now they can look at a piece
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
of property and and look in this
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
database all on their own correct yes
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
well they I should I should say that it
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
kind of works in a way it's a a
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
combination database and um human review
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know they're putting in
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
information to say this is the parcel
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to develop uh that
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
generates um basically a work order or a
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
work ticket for people in the natural
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau and Fish and Game to
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
then look at the results that are NE
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
near that area uh and so there's they're
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
using their expert knowledge of the you
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
know the types of records that were
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
returned and the age of them and what
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
they know about the area to say what do
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
we tell this person do we tell them it's
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's a no no violation or no no concern
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
in this area or yes you need to come
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
into us and get a recommendations and
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
those people are staying at that that
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
would be the group that would be coming
 
01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
would be the group that would be coming
to

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
Dees oh okay and I think and so in that
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
way there's be some good integration
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
with what we do when we work with other
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
applicants for pre-application views
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
giving them a heads up as to what we
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
would consider to be issues regarding
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
Wetlands permitting or Shoreland
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
permitting is are there fees for that
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
part or not there's a there's a fee
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
right now of $25 to do that data check
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
review I see uh in The hb2 Proposal uh
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
that fee would be increased to
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
$50 um and you know it's you can see
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
that it's it's more than just a database
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
ping there's people behind the scenes
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
who are doing you know a little mini
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
review yeah right and so that's where we
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
think because we have these experts able
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
to review these things we could
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
implement this high medium and low
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
categorization and would the $50 cover
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
both the plant and animal parts yes
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
right now it's it's combined data
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
database for Flora and Fauna gotcha okay
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
very good other questions represent
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I want to go back to
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
the Fine thing so um I believe Susan you
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
said that the department budgets about
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
$75,000 for Fine Collection um is there
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
someone and I I tried to find it in HBO
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
I couldn't see it is there a person
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
whose responsibility is in is
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement in
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
Dees so we we yeah in the land resources
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
management section yes I mean for for
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
are different divisions and different
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
programs within the agency there's not
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
one singular person that's that's
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
respons responsible for enforcement so
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
if it's a solid waste violation uh folks
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
in Sol compliance staff in solid waste
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
would handle that if it's a land
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
resources management issue which is
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
those four buckets subsurface which is
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
septic systems alteration of terrain uh
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
Shoreland and wetlands those there is a
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
a unit within that group for compliance
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
and enforcement and that and so those
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
folks handle those so but it really
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
depends on the the the section of the
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
agency that you're working in and but
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
and they're they're the closest to it
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
because they're the experts in those
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
specific rsas and the rules behind those
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
rsas and so uh to I think I don't know
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
if that answered your question but there
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
There's No One Singular person in the
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
entire agency that's responsible for
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
coordinating enforcement so yeah I guess
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
my concern is that the amount of fines
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
budgeted Don't Come Close I guess to the
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
the the budget to support that to to
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
support and enforcement so for instance
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
let's say if you had a a person or group
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
of people and you figure maybe the cost
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
of enforcement for their salary and
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
benefits and you know ancillary costs
 
01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
might be let's say 300,000 you're not
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
nearly covering that with the $75,000
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
budget okay thank you all right so
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
should we hear from fishing game and and
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
dncr to see if uh there's any objections
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
to any of this before we before we get
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
into the details of
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
version hello
 
01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.380 align:start position:0%
version hello
hi

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:57.390 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:58.910 align:start position:0%
hi
[Music]

01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
hello Sarah Stewart commissioner of the
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
resources thank you for um asking for
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
our thoughts and feelings um that's you
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
know you're known for that at division
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
one thoughts and feelings um we've had a
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations uh with Dees um
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
with my staff uh I brought director
 
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
Patrick Hackley from forest and lands um
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
his bureau chief for the uh natural
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau um I feel confident that
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
we can proceed with the with the plan as
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
Dees outlined um and you know we support
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
the mission to create efficiency um and
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
and are willing Partners to do whatever
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
we can to achieve that goal so just for
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
you we heard that two positions are
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
moving to Dees but then we've also heard
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
maybe four positions so is there so two
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
things going on yeah so originally um
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
before we got into the weeds um there
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
was the thought to include two people
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
from the um division of historical
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
resources as well and after examining
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
sort of the the end goal of this um
 
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
change it was unanimously decided that
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't help create efficiencies
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
um and so we amended that okay and I
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
assume these are two filled positions
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay good h
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Stephanie Simi
 
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
executive director for New Hampshire
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game I appreciate you all asking
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
us to come up here um as Sarah said uh
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
fishing game we are supportive of the
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
governor's initiative and desire to
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
streamline government efficiencies I'm
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
trying to do that myself as a new
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
director for an agency uh so I'm fully
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
100% behind that effort and as she also
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we have been working
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
closely with Dees and Dancer Department
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
of Natural and cultural resources to
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that we could um make this a
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
successful transition uh uh honestly it
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
does impact our agency probably more
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
significantly than the others but um I
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
think that we are finding a me median
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
ground that we can try to sustain what
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
we need to do uh many of the uh ideas
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
that we've been you've heard from the
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
team from dees are ideas that we had
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
been talking about prior to this
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
initiative as far as like um the data
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
check tool and in high you know creating
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
a high of sensitivity those sorts of
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
things but um you know admittedly from
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
my position we did an analysis and it's
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
really about 1.5 people that we need to
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
continue for our permitting uh reviews
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
outside of Dees but in order to make
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we have efficiency and success
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
on that end we can get by with the one
 
01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
person and we'll we'll see how it goes
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I may be coming back to my
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
own house Division and asking for some
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
other support but nonetheless we're
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to to make this work we
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
want it to be successful um we 100%
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
agree with the One-Stop shop um you know
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
obviously I am concerned about how it
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
affects our agency and in doing the
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
other permitting or not permitting
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me the environmental review that
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
is required of our agency uh we do
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
environmental review not just for uh
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
federal agencies but also for nonprofits
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
that are getting federal grants and we
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
provide that technical uh review because
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
our mandate is Fish and Wildlife
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
Resources and ensuring that there's no
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
impact to those so is the database they
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
talked about is that very accurate and
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
and can you really tell on this piece of
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
land that there are certain animals
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
living there and others that aren't and
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
things like that it is very it's it's a
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
good start it is very it's a very good
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
foundation to start from uh that does
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
vary by project uh some of the concerns
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
about different projects and what's
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
being proposed during a project can
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
impact species differently um the type
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
of species is important you know
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
particularly if you need to do surveys
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
it creates a delay in some of the work
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
so uh I think if we can we we be working
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
with Dees for developing best management
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
practices and trying to help develop a
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
high-grading system I think that we can
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
get there uh the data is not only just
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
the public input and such it's also it's
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
fishing games data we are inputting data
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
into that system so as we're doing
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
surveys as we're doing research we're
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
updating that database as best as we can
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
with with the materials that we get and
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
even Sarah's team is doing the same so
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
when your officers are out there
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere and they say oh I saw such and
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
such they come back and change the
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
database to yes mostly it's our
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
biologists that are actually doing some
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
field field census work but yes it's our
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
staff across the board that are helping
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
to update that thank you welcome to
 
01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
division one thank you I know I get the
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
best of both
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
worlds um not being as familiar with
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
your budget as as others might be what
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
is the source of funds for the
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
employee employees so right now this is
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
an excellent question thank you very
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
much for asking that so right now they
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
are funded through arpa which goes away
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
in December so this transition that
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it all if they all
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
go to Dees obviously they're going to
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
need funding to support them if one
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
remains with us we are going to need
 
01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
funding to support that position because
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
there is not it's a temporary position
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
at this point point and it was only
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
funded through the arpa funding so I
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
will if it stays with us I will be going
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
back to house division 2 asking for the
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
consideration of General funds for that
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
support but this whole endangered
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
species thing is not new right no it's
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
not new it's just escalated uh we have a
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
lot more projects a lot more uh
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
sensitivities and I will mention also
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
our environmental reiew is not just
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
limited to um threatening danger species
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
it's also about you know water quality
 
01:14:59.310 --> 01:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
and water flow so that we have good
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
healthy fish you know fish uh e
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and things like that there
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
are a variety of things that go into the
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
environmental review process on our end
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
the permitting end is a little different
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
right so I see okay representative EV
 
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
well it's just um I I definitely don't
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
know the whole history here but I think
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
that fish and game generally had been
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
really struggling with permitting and
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
then through arpa they had given you
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
four more people to try to improve the
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
process and you were sort of chugging
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
along and now we're rearranging things a
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
little bit so um I guess
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
it I'm thinking my original question if
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to streamline this
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
process and do better with permitting
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
across the three agencies it's just
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
really important that in taking this
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
look we give adequate funding and
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing not just for the agencies from
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
their end but for the people that are
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
trying to work it through and I just I
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
Adam you referred to this earlier I know
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are frustrated with the
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
delays and the response and I don't
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
blame the agencies I blame the Staffing
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
situation so I hope division two is kind
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
to you thank you thank you yes I I would
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think we I think I
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
although I was not here from what I have
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
gathered from the my in my investigation
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
of this whole situation is that yes we
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
did lack from staffing issues um we also
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
weren't uh at a point where we were
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
raising any fees to cover that Staffing
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
if that was a a potential option the
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
other thing I think that we may have
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
struggled with and I I think this is
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
where I I support what DS is is trying
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
to propose here is that we tried to work
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
through the process with the applicant
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
rather than just saying at this point if
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
we don't hear back from you it's a
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
denial so that I think created a lot
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
long history of working for months and
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
months and months when maybe we should
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
have just said no we don't have the
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
information from you it's a denial at
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
this point and you'll have to just come
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
back um so that it's a different
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
approach but I think it might help get
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
everybody back on starting a good
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
starting point and understanding what's
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
expected of each other and how we're
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
together okay all right so commissioner
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
are there other dncr sections here in
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
house Bild 2 um I guess we've already
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't do you have anything I don't think
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah Mr chair
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right great well then thank you
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
both for coming than chairman yes
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative Le I was trying to find
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%

actually I've only just been added to
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
the site just like within the last week
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%

thank you very much all right thank you
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
come back again
 
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.229 align:start position:0%
come back again
sometime

01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right any so I'm back to um
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
Dees and the sections 2 through five you
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
here this this red line
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
section representative McGuire yes can I
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
ask a question goad up them for the
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
environmental um scientist position I
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
noticed there's funding in hb2 is there
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
also fing in hb1 for that that's a
 
01:18:50.639 --> 01:18:52.310 align:start position:0%
also fing in hb1 for that that's a
duplicate

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
duplicate
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay so we'll division one will
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
need to remove the
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the environmental
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
scientist position from
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 from what from hb2 the environmental
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
hb1 I think it would be more appropriate
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
to leave it in the budget rather than
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
have it as an appropriation in
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
hb2 which which section are we talking
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
about um page seven uh section four
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
um Yes except there is
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
a when the positions were put in our
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
budget they were put in at 2080 hours
 
01:19:35.639 --> 01:19:36.629 align:start position:0%
budget they were put in at 2080 hours
not

01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
1950 so um we'll have to work on that
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
correction yeah yeah okay and I'm not
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
sure they are the same position I'm
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get the details on that as
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
well okay we can work offline on that
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay you're talking about line
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
19 on page 7 yes yes okay all right good
 
01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.070 align:start position:0%
19 on page 7 yes yes okay all right good
so

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
um back to the redline
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
version so the redline version you'll
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
see in front of you you have um I should
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
have I I said sections two through five
 
01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
but I should have uh numbered them in
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
the SE
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
section is that it um it changes it so
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
that currently under hb2 we would be
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
doing all of the reviews for any state
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
agency this what this is doing is it's
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
saying that uh other departments and
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
agencies who need to uh you know make
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
sure that projects don't appreciably
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the continued existence of a
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
species if they have uh staff internally
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
that can work on that then they can do
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
those in lie of working for fishing game
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
and so that the way that was the way we
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh figured that we could do that in that
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph so that's the intent
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
there um in paragraph 4 it is doing
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
similarly it's doing the same thing it
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
is narrowing it down to just RSA 482a
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
which is Wetlands uh
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
485a which is aot in uh 236 which is
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
driveway permits at do this was part of
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of our projects also
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
required do driveway permits so that was
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
another they're roping them in into this
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
into this proposal that's a fourth
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
agency that sometimes developers need to
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
deal with and so um we would be doing
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
those reviews as
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
well um representative leechman
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh or representative Ms I
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
believe mentioned uh one changing it
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
from 30 days to 180 days that's also
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
happening in that paragraph can I just
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
stop so even though you're taking over
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
the do permits you feel like you could
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
do it with the Staffing that you've set
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
up at this that's correct we you're not
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
taking people from do for this one we we
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
are not taking people from do it's we're
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
not doing the driveway permits we're
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
doing the environmental reviews when a
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
developer goes and gets a driveway
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
permit um typically they would still
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
need to work with fishing game as well
 
01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.790 align:start position:0%
need to work with fishing game as well
on

01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
on
that

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
um going down to paragraph five these
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
are just uh it's re re uh lettering if
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
you will and uh cleaning it up because
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
below the before paragraph 6 listed out
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
a bunch more statutes where this would
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
apply at Dees where it doesn't currently
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
apply and so we we changed that and
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
there was a duplicate in there as well
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
so we crossed that out um and so that
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
all of
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh five is attempting to do
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
the same thing um it's just it's just
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
rewarded to be more more approp
 
01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.750 align:start position:0%
rewarded to be more more approp
appropriately

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
worded and then the only change to
 
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
6 to 8 which is the dncr piece is also
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
days and then well let's let's go back
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
why is um Roman six being eliminated so
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
six so we're adding in
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph four we're adding those rsas
 
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
there was a duplicate in paragraph 6 and
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
then there was also they were going to
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
add Shoreland in there and that was a
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
that was a tech a technical mistake
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
currently Shoreland permits are
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
specifically not subject to these en
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
these environmental reviews oh I see and
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
so uh we're getting rid of that too so
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
but we're keeping the other three that
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
are in there and just moving it back to
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
a different paragraph
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we frequently get large numbers of
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
of pages in hb2 with all sorts of
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
reorganizations which troubles me as to
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
who initiates this process is it is it
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget person is it the
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
agency or well the alternative you could
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
have gone through the legislative
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
process so what who who initiated all
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
these changes so this this was
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
specifically a governor's office
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
proposal we worked with them heavily to
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that it would technically
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
work and obviously we're coming in with
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment because we didn't catch
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
everything initially uh as as you know
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
that when the new governor comes in they
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
have very little time to prepare their
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
changes to what the prior Governor um
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
creates and so there was a obviously we
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
were we were kind of Off to the Races to
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
get this done so we made some we we
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
didn't catch everything when we provided
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
them language and so this is an attempt
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
to fix some of those things at what
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
point were you contacted to about all
 
01:24:56.109 --> 01:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh we were contacted we knew that this
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
was a priority for governor aot um we
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
were contacted uh about doing some sort
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
of initiative early on and then as time
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
developed and they they were trying to
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
formulate what they what what they
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward with we were
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
contacted um sometime I believe at the
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
end of January I'd have to get you I
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact date okay and then
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
we'll likely have some input from the
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislators that deal with this area of
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
policy and they'll come to it and do
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
some more changes
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
so yes for the
 
01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:35.719 align:start position:0%
Beast it's a lot of red lines yes I I uh
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the red lines but we
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that this will
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
technically work
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
if yeah now we heard from representative
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
Aaron right about there may be some
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
bills here right
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
so but that's landfills that's landfills
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
right okay but it's not this fishing
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
game kind
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
of not end dangerous speeches find out
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
get I I'm not aware of any bills aside
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
from Senate Bill 110 and maybe maybe a
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
few others but nothing significant that
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
would address what sections uh two
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
through eight are trying to address okay
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
so the only possible problem it seems
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
like in
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
section uh is section for this
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation right otherwise yes the
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriation that's a duplicate
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
yeah and then obviously the red lines
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
would need to kind of go over what
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
what's in the existing version of hb2
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
but yes yes I agree I wish we didn't
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
have to spend as much time on these
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
changes when we're trying to balance the
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
budget yes I agree with you okay all
 
01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
right why don't we keep going section
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
seven okay this this is on
 
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
page uh eight of house bill
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
to eight
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
yeah if people are following house buil
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
to section seven six s and8 uh implement
 
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
the D the dncr portions of this proposal
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
and so they're moving the environmental
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
reviewers from from dncr to Dees okay um
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
that that happens in house bill one and
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill two is the act the
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
authorities for what those reviewers do
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
Dees okay and so the oh so the only
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
change here is the 180 days correct
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
correct gotcha okay and
 
01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
then um we haven't gotten there but
 
01:27:42.119 --> 01:27:43.070 align:start position:0%
then um we haven't gotten there but
there

01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
are some cleanup uh technical changes
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to make to what we provided
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
in the budget it's eliminating the
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
rivers Council which is a a a
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entity um in Statue
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
they Pro they are able to sort of
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
investigate Wetlands permits and provide
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
feedback to us actually before we get to
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
section 13 yep should we talk about
 
01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.310 align:start position:0%
section 13 yep should we talk about
section

01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
nine 9 10 and so on yes so sorry we're
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
kind of flipping between a bunch of
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
documents here so 910 and then it's 1516
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
so I I they're kind of out of order and
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 but um going back to that
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet where the title is House
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 proposal
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
descriptions um that's overwater Boat
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
House guard rails so over overwater boat
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
houses we re historically have not
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
approved those um at the at the
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
department we've we've approved Doug in
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
boat houses and we
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
recently received a a legal
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation from the Attorney
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
General's office that the we can't look
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
at the Aesthetics we can't look at that
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh anything other than the environmental
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
factors when it comes to boat houses and
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
so they have sort of reverse that uh so
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
what we are going to be seeing in the
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
future are proposals for overwater boat
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
houses and we will not we would have to
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
consider them and potentially approve
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
them if they meet all the environmental
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
um criteria and so would would such a
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
boat house be floating or would it be
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
attached to a to a piling of some kind
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
or uh it would be attached to some sort
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
of dock or piling or something of that
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
nature um so it would have an access way
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
to to the shore but the pro the problem
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
that was foreseen here is that because
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
of that uh changeing
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation you could you could build
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
something pretty large and still receive
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
approval multiple stories and um other
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
issues with that yes and so what this is
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
attempting to to do is limit it to one
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
story and say that it needs to be
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
related to boat boats or boating
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
activity um there was some concern in
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's office when we let them
 
01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
know about this technical or this legal
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation this change um and it is
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
a major change because these do go in
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
front of the governor and Council as
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
well because they are uh technically the
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
owners of the of the public water the
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
land under the public water and so um
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted to put some guard rails on
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
on boat houses and what what might be
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
proposed um otherwise you might end up
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
with very large structures coming in
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
front of the governor and Council I see
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
I um gave these sections to the
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
resources committee uh chair but I
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back yet so okay go ahead
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like much of this is being
 
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
driven by your Communications with the
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
attorney general uh it is a recent it's
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
a change in interpretation of the law
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so so we we are now required to
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
consider these and potentially approve
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
them regardless of the size we have to
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
only consider the environmental aspects
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the application and so you
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
could get something that's 10 stories
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
and we may be have to send it to
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
governor and Council gotcha where's the
 
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.679 --> 01:31:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
n so nine nine and 10 sections 9 and 10
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
on page nine they create the definitions
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh what a boat house is and they also
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
create a definition of what the
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
structural height is and
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
then um you know in sections 15 and 16
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
which are on
 
01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:55.310 align:start position:0%
which are on
page

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
12 those
 
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
Define struct uh those
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
those set out uh the structural height
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
18t it would have been nice if they were
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
grouped together but they were they're
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
so me oh I see stri yes I see line 11 of
 
01:32:25.199 --> 01:32:28.070 align:start position:0%
so me oh I see stri yes I see line 11 of
page

01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
12 no second floor all this sort
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
stuff but this is all new right I mean
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
this is a that that is that is a new
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph um we historically have not
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
approved overwater boat houses we have
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
approved Doug in boat houses um and
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
because of the change in legal
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
interpretation in overwater Bow house is
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
actually more environmentally friendly
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
than in Dugen bow house and therefore we
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
will be we we are required to consider
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
these overwater structures does a dugin
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
so so the question is if if these are
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
more environmentally friendly than the
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
dugin one why are we restricting them
 
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we encourage them you know
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
so it has been a historic legal
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
interpretation that we could not approve
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
them and is is a recent in sort of our
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and in myself looking
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
into this issue we have determined with
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office that that
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
is no longer an accurate legal
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation um it it's been a
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the 1980s I don't know
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to add to
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
that no I and again so given that legal
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation we the presumption was
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
and obviously it' be up to a legislature
 
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
that others around the Lakes wouldn't
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to see two three four five story
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
developments happening over the over the
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
water blocking their views and things
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
like that yeah based on our experience
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
that would not go over well so so we the
 
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
thought was to put some guard rails
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
legal guard rails low and then maybe
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
change all right represent
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
evil represent doesn't matter I
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
win couple questions so with the dugin
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
boat houses they still have to go
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
through a wet Wetlands permit right
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
because they're in that Wetlands
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
range they they would have to get a
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
permit and oftentimes we we do if
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're if they're large structures
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
major major structures we do send them
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
to governor and Council as well um where
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of policy decision is made
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not to move them forward or
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
not we we simply look at the the criter
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
the environmental criteria on the
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
dugins um you know this this new legal
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
interpretation to expand the universe to
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
overwater that that could create I think
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
a I think we were seeing a potential
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
political problem right where you have
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
these giant five six story structures
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
being proposed and we would have to
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
approve them and move them on to the
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and so I think that
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
the intent of this was to uh set some
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
guard rails around that so that and it's
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
very black and white because you know
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
obviously that is the pview of the
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to set uh the Aesthetics you
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
know we're the environmental agency so
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
we we uh we should not be in the realm
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
of determining whether something is
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
aesthetically pleasing or or not and I
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
think that's that was uh the intent here
 
01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
was to actually lay the Aesthetics piece
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
out in statute okay two more question
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
two more questions um so with the over
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
thewater boat houses so you're
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
restricting the height but what if a
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's an existing boat house and they
 
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
the owner wants to increase the square
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
footage um is that covered would that be
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
covered under your Authority so th so
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is only affecting things after I
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's February of
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
2025 okay so so if they want so if they
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in for a modification uh
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
they could if they're if they're kind of
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
replacing in kind if you will we would
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
we would allow that okay but what if
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
footage you
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
want you know maybe maybe the boat house
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
now is you know suitable for one boat
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
what if they wanted to increase the
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
square footage so they could fit you
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
know maybe kayaks or maybe a small
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
boat okay yes uh thank you for the
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
question um as you as you're aware with
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
with um docking structures there's a
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
limit to the size of the structure based
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
on the Frontage that the person owns and
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
and that has to do you know basically
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
the number of slips that they can have
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
on that Frontage so there is a limit to
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
what they could have in terms of the
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
size of one of these um structures based
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
on the Frontage that they own so we
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
would review it just like we' review any
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
other docking structure and I think one
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that that helps with this
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
proposal is it allows us to apply the
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
least environmentally impacting
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
principle to all docking
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
structures um B I think it's very hard
 
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
anyone to argue that a dugin boat house
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
is the least environmentally impacting
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
structure okay and so we would take the
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
approach of do you meet the you know
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
under our Wetland rules do you meet the
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
requirements for a permanent structure
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
on the on the shoreline if you do
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter to us oh do you
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
meet and and the size of that structure
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
is governed by the Frontage that you own
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
after that it really doesn't matter to
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
us whether it's a permanent dock or a
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
boat house but I think there was concern
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
about that becoming a lighthouse or
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
something you know some very you know
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know building yeah and hence the
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
height restriction it's the most minimal
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
architectural restriction that we could
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
add okay I got you so it would really
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
fall under docking structure than the
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
boat house and then but over thewater
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
boat houses are they still still subject
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
to um any town uh building permit
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
requirements that that varies um but one
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
of the things that the reason for this
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
is that um because it's over submerged
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
public lands of State lands there's
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
certainly questions about the
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
applicability of town building codes and
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
and so the the need for some sort of
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh guard rail okay one more um
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
now so if you have over theater boat
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
houses but they're not subject to uh
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
Town Authority as far as building
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
permits could they still be added to the
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
assessed value of the onland structures
 
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.629 align:start position:0%
assessed value of the onland structures
and

01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
property this is getting outside of my
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
realm of understanding this would be
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
more of a municipal
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
question unfortunately I don't know the
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
answer to that okay thank you do do you
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
regulate docks and like how long the
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
dock can be and how heavy and things
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
like that yeah you know we regulate
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
docks and as I mentioned there's there's
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh restrictions regarding the size of
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
the docks and the number of slips based
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
on the amount of Frontage and um based
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
on the you know the depth of the water
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a big part of our
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
permitting program and so this will you
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
know by boat houses has been part of
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
that but it's had this not necessar
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
logical conclusion that you know a dug
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
in boat house is possible when it really
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
has a pretty large impact on the banks
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
of the of these water bodies presumably
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
a a boat house has a septic connection
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
right to to land right so uh wait these
 
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
would be not boat houses these would be
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
not struck dwellings over water this is
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
and also that's part of what the
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
guardrail here is to say this is only
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
for the servicing of boats oh okay house
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
for the boat not for the people yeah
 
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
right I see exactly uh we can't have a
 
01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
bathroom is that what you're saying
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
correct it does not have a bathroom
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
dwelling over water is an entirely
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
different thing and those are would only
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
be you know I got it okay repres
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional would they still allow a
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
dugin boat house seems to me it even get
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
more complicated now you're really into
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
dredge and fill into the into the lake
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
or the river or whatever uh the answer
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
is no we would not that's what I thought
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that that brings some
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
sort of logic to this process any that
 
01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
are left 100 years old or 50 years old
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
yeah the pre-jury would remain obviously
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
they would not have to be removed all
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
right represent V just less of a
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
question more of a comment I would just
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
say that I I really appreciate and
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
applaud you including this in hb2
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
because living in an area with Lakes
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
these things everywhere are growing like
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
Topsy at every opportunity and I think
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
this is a good provision and thanks for
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
bringing forward thank you okay but I
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
still represented Lehman yeah thank you
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman notice we kind of jumped to
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
boat houses but we jumped over the fees
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
on 14 I know if you're going to talk
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
about those or I guess I had a question
 
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
for you and representative wer whether
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
we ship those proposals over to Ways and
 
01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
or oh I see yeah yeah did you C copy
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
them on those pages or not NE
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily I don't
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
think okay let me make a note of this
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
14 okay and those and and just to
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
reiterate those are to support the
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
additional staff coming over after this
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
bium um the the intent there is to
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have enough resources to
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
make to to pay for those positions once
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
I was going to add I like that
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
approach okay good so um all
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
right so all right now we're done with
 
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
boats right
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
so Phil do you want to stay up here for
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
the the rivers Council um so we talked
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
about the fee increases that's 11 and 12
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
so we'll go to the next page um on the
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
chart we have section 13
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
which is uh we we named it streamling
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
permanently only in that it does a
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
couple of um specific things relative to
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
The Rivers Council and the extensions
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
for um for permits and I Phil you want
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
to kind of describe those in a little
 
01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
detail surely uh so in the in the
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
Wetland statute uh local conservation
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
commissions are able to put what's
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
called a 40-day hold on a Wetlands
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
permit which um you know basically
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
prevents the department from making a
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
decision for 40 days and that gives
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
these count these what um conservation
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
commission's time to review the project
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
and give us comments I think what they
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
wanted the point of that part of the
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
statute is to prevent the department
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
from quickly approving something before
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
a a Conservation Commission that meets
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
monthly is able to meet and provide
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
comments um that statute went a little
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
bit further to say that a Conservation
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
Commission can request a second 40-day
 
01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
Commission can request a second 40-day
hold

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
um in our experience that happens very
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
very very rarely um and just through you
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
know knowing the uh the objectives and
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
the priorities of the uh Governor we
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
were looking for ways that we could um
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate requirements that you know
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
aren't adding a lot of value and maybe
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
slowing down the process and so um we
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
suggested that as a as something that
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
could be removed um in reviewing that
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
section it it there's it also me
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
mentions uh local River advisory
 
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
committees which are duly appointed
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
committees that are around the
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
designated Rivers uh in the state and
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
they provide similar functions as a
 
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission and they're
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
place-based they you know they're uh
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
they have eyes and ears on the ground
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
they can tell us if a proposal you know
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
has some flaws or something that we're
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
not aware of um the there was also in
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
the statute we realized the New
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rivers Council which is is in
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
a a nonprofit organization that's not um
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
one of these con these local River
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
advisory committees it's Statewide it
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that same place-based
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
nature uh so it just didn't seem to fit
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
with what else was in the rest of the
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
statute so that was the suggestion okay
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that that being able to
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
hold the permit for for that Rivers
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
Council um we don't provide that to any
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
other sort of private nonprofit um
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
entity so we thought that was
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate and getting rid of the
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
40-day hole is what that does there is
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
one small going back to the redline
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
version sorry I'm going to to different
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
documents there we're adding we missed
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
one reference to The Rivers Council so
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're adding that in when we when we
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
prepared this change and so that's
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's um I see yeah so there's that and
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
then so if there's no questions on that
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
one I'll jump to 14 which is alteration
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
of permits basically we're striking that
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
section and we're adding the language of
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
s SP 110 that has had a a lot of debate
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the senate committee and has a lot of
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
good work was done on that and so we
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
feel like that proposal uh it's the
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
permit by notification and the increase
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
in a alteration of terrain fees those
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
two things kind of go hand inand in that
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
proposal and so the the hope is that
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
this committee would adopt the s sp110
 
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
language um to to to move that forward
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
so there's that so that's what is going
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
on there there's a lot of red but
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
basically it's it's eliminating that
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
section 14 and replacing it with
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
sp110 um representative evil yeah thank
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
you Sor just going up in the red you're
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
de trying to follow the bouncing balls
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
but uh that uh it it was old
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
C1 it says a project that would result
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
in a discharge of storm water within a
 
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
quarter of a mile of a Class A surface
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
water are you removing a approval
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for that or did it move to
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
some other home the no so that that was
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
in addition to when we when we were
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
creating this permit by notification
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
language we wanted to put those two
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
criteria C1 and C2 we realized that we
 
01:47:15.589 --> 01:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
could just write that we would have
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
rulemaking ability and we can
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate that in the rules and and we
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
will incorporate that in the rules yes I
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
heard it
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay can you clear clarify for me when
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
you say permit by notification what does
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
that mean so a permit by notification is
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
when a developer or applicant submits uh
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
a proposal to us and the plans in that
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
proposal um instead of a a review uh
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
beforehand we would um have those plans
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
and we would review them after the fact
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
and make and then uh make sure that that
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
they're in compliance with all the
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
requirements after the fact Phil can
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit more detail around
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
that because again he lives the day
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
today but that's
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes yes so the the interest of this the
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
um enr committee from the Senate was to
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
speed up permitting and so they're
 
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
asking for these smaller projects which
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
were at the lower end of our alteration
 
01:48:17.709 --> 01:48:17.719 align:start position:0%
of train category could we just you know
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
we have good Engineers they develop
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
plans um if they submit them and there
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
you know um then you don't have to
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
review them before the work could start
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know the work could start upon
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
notification of the work uh and then if
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
there were any deficiencies that we were
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
to discover either through review of the
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
plans or through a field inspection you
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
know obviously they'd have to fix them
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
so it it converts uh it goes a bit from
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
a permitting upfront to an auditing type
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
function uh and so we thought for these
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
smaller projects that would be
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it didn't it still gives
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
us authority to take enforcement should
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
we need to but it does allow for you
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
know 20% of our applications to move
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
forward at a much faster Pace but these
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
are still designs made by a licensed
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
person right correct it must be
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
submitted by a professional engineer and
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
stamped okay so this is an area where
 
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard that somebody complained to
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
me it was a builder that when they build
 
01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.629 align:start position:0%
me it was a builder that when they build
in

01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
Maine they just go to the professional
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
license Ed person that person gives them
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
a a stamp plan and then they build to
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
that plan and that's it they don't have
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
to go to your the equivalent of Dees and
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
get their engineer to check the licensed
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
person's plan that it's still okay you
 
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
know what I mean so it's like in New
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's like two such
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
Engineers involved in any plan sort of
 
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
thing whereas in Maine they say well the
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
person's license the what they're doing
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's okay is that all true
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
or is that am I sort of simplifying it
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
somehow or well I guess I'd characterize
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
it in terms of the measure twice cut
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
once adage um about well over well more
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
than half and close to all of our
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
reviews discover deficiencies in the
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
storm water um
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
calculations uh and you know these are
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
areas where I think we have very
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
talented Engineers on staff who are
 
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
stretching things and you improving the
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
process and um for an alteration of
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
terrain we're talking about 100,000
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
square ft which is almost is 2.3 Acres
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
these are Big projects and um the goal
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
here is to uh protect the the ab
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
buttering properties from changes in the
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
hydrology so you imagine a you know a
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
big box store that's going to go from
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
Woods to Pavement it's going to change
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
the way the storm water runs and we've
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
all help dealt with the the questions
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
from people and constituents who say you
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
know this development came in and now I
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
have flooding in my basement now I you
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
know it didn't always used to be this
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
way but now my driveways you know washed
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
out at the bottom the goal here with
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain is that the post
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
construction conditions match what the
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
preconditions were but if it's a house
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
then there isn't such a heavy review is
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
correct because because a house is you
 
01:51:22.350 --> 01:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
know 4,000 you know 5,000 square fet so
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's not even relative to this we only
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
looking for for housing we're generally
 
01:51:28.510 --> 01:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
looking at subdivisions and subdivisions
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
with 20 to 30 Lots I understand repr
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
W one of the reasons why we always have
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
to look through hb2 and wonder why they
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
did what they did is one year it was
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
heavily filled with OP office of
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing and
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
certification and they eliminated 30
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
licenses one of them being an engineer
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
and an architect and I said what's going
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
on here and they said well we don't get
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
many complaints about them we don't
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
think we need them and I said I guess
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
you don't know the law if you want to
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
submit a plan to the to the um
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
registered Deeds it better be from a
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
licensed engineer if you want to go to a
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
planning board it better be a licensed
 
01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
engineer if you want to go to you it
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
better be from a licensed I'm thinking
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
who comes up with this stuff so every
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
time I look at hp2 I look at it with a
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
jaist eye from some of the past
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
experience that who the heck comes up
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
with this stuff that's why I ask who
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
initiates this and it's obviously
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
not your Division and not probably from
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
some Engineers because when I saw that
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
one from oplc I couldn't believe it
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating 30 licenses because we
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
haven't had
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
complaints about some of and the other
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
ones that got very upset were Landscape
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
Architects because there were only 200
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
of them so why do we need to bother okay
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative evil yeah I was I
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that um on the on
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
these permits that relate to alteration
 
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
of terrain and it at a time when the
 
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
storm uh intensity is increasing so we
 
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
have like 100e storms every other year
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I just know from being on a planning
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
board in my town for almost 20 years the
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
storm water issue and the wetlands
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
incursion and the number of people
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
complaining about water in their
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
basement when they didn't have it before
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's just really really important which
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
is another reason why we just have to be
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
sure that you have the funding to do the
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
job that you're setting yourselves up
 
01:53:35.709 --> 01:53:35.719 align:start position:0%
for uh absolutely right representative
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is uh this this type of permit is
 
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to to ensuring
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're not you know properties are not
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
flooding out their neighbors or uh
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that and so you know we we
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
take that very seriously um you know we
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
we do believe the 100 to 100
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
50,000 it could be eligible for a permit
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
by notification process but anything
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
above that I think you know the original
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
proposal in sb10 just to give you a
 
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
quick note was 200,000 square feet and
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
we had said that's that's going a little
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
too far those are huge that's a huge
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
development so we we paired it back to
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
150,000 Square fet in that in this and
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
so that's that's our um that was our
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
desire here was to we think that's the
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
right the right uh thresholds
 
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
so if I wanted to know the fiscal impact
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
of this new section 14 I should go look
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note on Senate Bill 110 is
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
that it or I so there was an amendment
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 110 I don't know if
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
they've submitted a fiscal note to us
 
01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
recently for that Amendment but they
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
meliss and but but the this includes the
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
fee increases so it would cover the cost
 
01:54:53.709 --> 01:54:53.719 align:start position:0%
of any reduction in review that that
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
would occur here so so it it would be a
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
net positive for the Department um under
 
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
this proposal or for the general fund
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
what year Senate Bill 110 2023 202 this
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
this year 20252 thank you a net positive
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
for the department or for the general f
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
department so you can do your job to
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
well and and the idea behind that was it
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
would be in coordination with hb2 to
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that we had the resources to take
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
on on the additional staff so that's
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
part of this the additional staff from
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
the other two agencies that we just
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned I see okay Melissa you wanted
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
to say something I was just going to say
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
um our office just got the amendment to
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
this bill this morning so it's already
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
okay so in the you will have something
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative evil didn't the
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
governor put another
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
$275,000 in your budget for this no it
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
was something else it's okay that so
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was for that supervisor position I
 
01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
believe that was section four in hb2
 
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
and I think Melissa's going to work with
 
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
Susan Carlson to ensure that that's
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
that's synced up thank you
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
representative R I just want to confirm
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
are all the fees you collect for permits
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
do they go into the water resources fund
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
do any go to the general fund all of the
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
fees that we collect for land resources
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
management go into um the Water
 
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
Resources fund okay thank
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
you okay for trash is that coming next
 
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.149 align:start position:0%
you okay for trash is that coming next
so

01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
the next thing is the solid waste site
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee um this is a very
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
large proposal it's about 10 pages long
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the the summary of this one is that
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
um let me just get my notes out here it
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
establishes a solid waste site
 
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee for large
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
facilities 100,000 uh tons of throughput
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
or more um excluding Municipal
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
facilities and and it includes expansion
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
so if an existing facility wanted to
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
expand and that expansion is more than
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
100,000 tons of throughput which is how
 
01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
much waste is going through the facility
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's disposed there or it's a
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
transfer station they would need to come
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
in uh they would obviously do all the
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
dees and other permitting reviews at the
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
state level and then they would filter
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
to this new entity it's a it's the site
 
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and it's a me it's
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
a five member board and they would look
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
at things
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
like um the types of waste and
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
quantities of waste and their
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
characteristics the sources of waste
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
where the waste is coming from as a
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
factor um visual impacts uh impacts the
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
property values tourism outdoor
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
recreation traffic noise and odor uh
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
economic impacts and any other
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
information requested by the committee
 
01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.030 align:start position:0%
information requested by the committee
and

01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
so the the intent of this was to have
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
this this new entity look at impact that
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
are not already contemplated by other
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
state agencies or Dees and so uh and to
 
01:58:03.069 --> 01:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
allow for greater Regional and Municipal
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
input uh and and the folks who live in
 
01:58:08.669 --> 01:58:08.679 align:start position:0%
those areas input into the process and
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
so um is this taken from some Bill or no
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is house bill this isn't
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 no it's it's a own proposal
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
it is similarly situated as the existing
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee but a lot of
 
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
the technical defects for that uh that
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
committee which which considers energy
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
facilities have been corrected in this
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
in this proposal some of the nuances new
 
01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
stuff right yeah so there's it's new
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
stuff okay fine um and so when I read
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
this proposal my assumption was you will
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
never open a dump in New Hampshire again
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way it reads
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that's the intent I
 
01:58:59.310 --> 01:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
think the intent is to have a greater I
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
mean 12 pages of this you can't do this
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
you got to go there you got to go here
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
you got to go everywhere you got to
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
check odor if anybody can see it from a
 
01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.589 align:start position:0%
check odor if anybody can see it from a
surrounding

01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
town it's bad all this kind of stuff
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
it's just it's going to make it
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
impossible to ever open a dump again in
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
new yeah I I would tend to think you
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
could get representative evil or some
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
some friendly lend lator to put this in
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
as a bill and see what happens to it you
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
know me this was this was the governor's
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
proposal um it does include a one-year
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
moratorium or greater on on uh Solid
 
01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.510 align:start position:0%
moratorium or greater on on uh Solid
Waste

01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
facilities um or until the rules have
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
been passed by the committee so it may
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
take 18 months for the committee to pass
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
rules through jail car or something like
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
that so it would be whatever one of
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
those whichever one is later and so this
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
was the governor obviously VI L the
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal it's something she's
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
very passionate about I'm sure you've
 
01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard that um it's the intent is
 
02:00:02.350 --> 02:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
not to and and I think we we helped
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
write it to ensure that it would not uh
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
stop all landfills in New Hampshire
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
right I think the idea is to allow for a
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
lot more public input and consider the
 
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
things that probably should be
 
02:00:18.030 --> 02:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
considered but are not considered
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
currently under these un for these types
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
of proposals
 
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
um and oh God what's the effect on the
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
budget of these section so the inten is
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
for it to be self-funded similar to the
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee when
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
applicants come in for a uh review they
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
would pay a filing fee under this uh
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
proposal it's
 
02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
$20,000 and then additional to that uh
 
02:00:47.229 --> 02:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's for every it's scales up so
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
something that's around 500,000 tons of
 
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
throughput would be around $660,000
 
02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
the applicant would have to pay into
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
this into this proposal is there any is
 
02:01:00.069 --> 02:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
there a similar fee now or not uh we do
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
have we do have Solid Waste um Fe
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
application fees at the department but
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a separate review it be
 
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
outside of the there this would be
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to us
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
similarly to how the Energy site
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee administrative
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of energy but
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
it would be self-funded it would be it
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
would it would sort of be outside of our
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
on top of existing fees on top of
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
existing fees representative e will then
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
representative okay so just in the um
 
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
chair Wier referred to his conversation
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
with um chair Aaron that there is some
 
02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
bills that have been working their ways
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
way through the house regarding
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
landfills so two of them haven't
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually passed yet but one did pass
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday this HB 215 and it actually is
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
something called the net benefits
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
analysis and the idea of the net
 
02:01:59.069 --> 02:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
benefits analysis is very similar to the
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that you have here for the
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
for the SEC so I'm just saying in terms
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
of um a more Global approach to these
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
things that concept is in is embodied in
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
this so it's so it does align with house
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
policy at this point because we've U
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
adopted this bill so the other bill
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's out there that just came through
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
Ena is a three-year as opposed to a
 
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
one-year moratorium and then there's
 
02:02:34.069 --> 02:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
another bill hb77 that I'm actually not
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
as familiar with but though I just
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that those were the
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
three bills that um that chair Aaron had
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned um okay to so HB 215 what else
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I asked U Melissa to make
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
copies for us so that's here um that's
 
02:02:53.790 --> 02:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
just different approach it's
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
not embodying the SEC approach right I'm
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
just talking about the more Global
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to say and I would
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
want to comment on that you know we we
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
would certainly prefer this proposal
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
obviously it's the governor's proposal
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
number one um and we're part of the
 
02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
executive branch but number two you know
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
I think the difference between 215 uh HB
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
215 and this proposal is that this
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
independent a or body would make these
 
02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh determinations where as we don't have
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
the the expertise to um consider I think
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of what's in in HB 2 25 and I
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't know Mike do you want to comment
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
on on the some of the Nuance differences
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
between those these two proposals sure I
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
well I think yeah two as as assistant
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Kos indicated there's
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's really two fundamental
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
differences I think between the between
 
02:03:50.669 --> 02:03:50.679 align:start position:0%
what's in hp2 and what's in 2115 first
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
um it uh it is it would be Dees that
 
02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
would make the decisions in both it
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
still creates a bifurcated process so
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's a and and and the second
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
difference is is that it puts that
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
initial sighting decision that the site
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee would make that
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
idea in 215 happens first rather than
 
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards so that's a fundamental
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
difference and um so and again the other
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
piece is that it would have Dees making
 
02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
these decisions not only in its normal
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
traditional permitting um uh program but
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
also these uh broader evaluations of
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
potential Community impacts like
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
property values uh business impacts um
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
Recreation and uh uh you know various
 
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
aesthetic issues so um we had testified
 
02:04:41.229 --> 02:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
on 215 when it was in house Ena and uh
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know the we didn't take a position
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
on the bill the issues we identified as
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
potential concerns were that we didn't
 
02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
feel that our staff you know we have
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
very good scientists in Engineers who
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
are absolutely prepared to do the work
 
02:04:57.069 --> 02:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
we do which is to evaluate uh the design
 
02:04:58.830 --> 02:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
and operation and construction of a
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
proposed facility um and to make sure
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that the permit if it's issued
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
provides all the the necessary
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
protections for Environmental
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
Protections but we're not experts on um
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
property values or uh business
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
recreational impacts scope is a little
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
too right so so I think that you know
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
and certainly we we support what's in
 
02:05:22.589 --> 02:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
hb2 I I think what we see as an
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
advantage there is that that's a broader
 
02:05:26.589 --> 02:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
group of folks who are brought together
 
02:05:28.549 --> 02:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
who under the provisions of the bill can
 
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
bring in experts as they need to to
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate these V and even require the
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
applicant to to provide reports or
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
studies of various issues so I think
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's an important issue the other
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
piece I think is that um
 
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
in the uh the build in hb2 the the after
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
the fact after so the way it's
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
structured any Dees per permits whether
 
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
they be a solid waste permit or an air
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
permit or aot or or a Wetlands permit
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
would need to be evaluated in a decision
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
made before it would come to that second
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
step if any of those were denials then
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
probably the project would be dead at
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
that point there would be no need to go
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
to that second step but if those were
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
all approved then it could go to the
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and the
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
advantage there is that then when you're
 
02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
making these key broad decisions about
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
broader Community impacts you know
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what the project looks like it's
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
been through the vetting and a
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
permitting process at the department you
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
know and and anybody who's gone through
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
that process knows that from the time of
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
the initial application to a final
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
decision by the department project
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
changes a bit you know we say it's not
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
complete and they change their proposal
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit they may make design
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
changes based on our technical review so
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
under the the program the the process
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's described in
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 you're going to know exactly what
 
02:06:48.549 --> 02:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
that project is at that point and the
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
project that comes to the site
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee will be very well
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
defined and that will put that Committee
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
in a great position to actually make
 
02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
these evaluations on these broader
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
impacts does the site evaluation
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
committee have any full-time
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
employees so that's one one of the
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
technical changes we need to make uh the
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
original draft and it got lost in the
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
drafting process I don't know where but
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
it got lost in the drafting process we
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
are uh originally is proposed it was
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the administ current
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
administrator of the site evaluation
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
Committee in the uh in the Pu uh that
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
person has some bandwidth as I
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
understand it to be able to perform
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
these tasks when needed and so the idea
 
02:07:33.709 --> 02:07:33.719 align:start position:0%
was for that person they're really a
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
process type person they they uh accept
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
the applications they do all the filing
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
they work work on that and make sure
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
that the committee is updated and
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
prepared when they are uh deliberating
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
in public and so that is uh what we
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
would uh need for a technical change to
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that the administrator of the
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
current energy sec would also be able to
 
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
do this uh again it's a process person
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a policy role it's really a
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
process role and and and they're really
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh trained in that so okay
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair um
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
there was quite a bit of work done last
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
bi Anum and maybe even before that to um
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
streamline the operation of the uh the
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee for energy
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
projects uh was that uh were those
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
changes uh kind of Incorporated in this
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
as well so they taking advantage of that
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
work yes so one one of the biggest
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
pieces of that was streamlining the
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
membership there were quite a few
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
members of the SEC and for for for some
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
dockets that are ongoing there still are
 
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
for uh new dockets after that change was
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
made it's only a five member and that's
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in here um so it' be a five
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
member board panel and uh some of the
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
other efficiencies were also also
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
adopted in here as well um around public
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
process and all of that um you know the
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
the hope is that this would provide a
 
02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
lot of community uh in public process to
 
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that those communities have a
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
have a say in in what's what's what's
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
being proposed from it from the
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
standpoint that the state agencies don't
 
02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
regulate representative thank you um so
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to admit that this was of
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
great interest to me and so I did spend
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
some time with the folks at Dees and we
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
had a really I thought fruitful and long
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
conversation about it I really like the
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
idea of having a separate site
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee for landfills um I
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
think they put a lot of pro thought into
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
the process here and comparing it with
 
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
what they do um in the energy context I
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
mean I just know from my own experience
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
working with them the establishment of a
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
new major landfill in the state of New
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you know has just been an
 
02:10:01.229 --> 02:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
unbelievably contentious difficult
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
longstanding uh
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
process I don't know if you would say it
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
I feel like it it eats the the staff
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
time alive over there it's a really
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
difficult process and uh and I
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
understand why because there's a lot of
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
concern and this sort of thing would
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
sort of remove it from Dees make it a
 
02:10:28.549 --> 02:10:28.559 align:start position:0%
freestanding um process and you know
 
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
really the SEC would for this wouldn't
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
really be active unless there's a major
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
solid waste facility application coming
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
through right so it's the same with the
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
p the SEC for energy that's why I think
 
02:10:44.109 --> 02:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
the administrator has some bandwidth
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
right because they're not always um
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
active I just to share with the
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee I had a few concerns one was
 
02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
to um right now Dees permits are
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
appealed to the waste management Council
 
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I was concerned when I saw that the
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
waste management Council um chair was
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
also the chair of the SEC and they said
 
02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
that the way this is set up and I see it
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
here the the appeal process is through
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
the superior court so I thought that was
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
really um really a good thing um I think
 
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
it's worth looking at this hb25 just to
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
combine just to compare the metrics a
 
02:11:28.589 --> 02:11:28.599 align:start position:0%
little bit um so that maybe there's some
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
alignment I do know that uh we have a
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
the the ENA is going to be proposing a
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
three-year moratorium we'll have to see
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
how all that works out um one of the
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
things I was concerned about was the
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
$20,000 fee and you just said something
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
Adam and I and I might have missed it I
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
I felt like there maybe should be
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
starting at 20,000 and maybe graduated
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
up because you know if you're proposing
 
02:11:57.239 --> 02:11:58.549 align:start position:0%
up because you know if you're proposing
a

02:11:58.549 --> 02:11:58.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
500,000 ton whatever a day or whatever
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
it is um uh transfer or landfill seems
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
like you could pay a little more for all
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
the incredible amounts of work that's
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
going to go into this versus a smaller
 
02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
facility so if if you let me I can
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
comment on that so uh the base charge is
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
20 ,000 for 100,000 uh tons of
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
throughput and then it does escalates
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per additional 10,000 tons of
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
throughput so uh I used 500,000 tons as
 
02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:37.559 align:start position:0%
an example but that would yield uh
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
$6,000 in revenue from the filing fees
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
and just for context uh some of the
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
members do get paid for their time uh
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
because you know it's very difficult to
 
02:12:49.870 --> 02:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
find people for these volunteer roles
 
02:12:51.870 --> 02:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be around $50 a days is what we
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
calculated it out um so even if they
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
went you know uh you know 50 days you
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
know they would only be uh it would be
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
only like
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
$25,000 and so the fee we we do feel
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
like the fees would cover the way it's
 
02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
written right now we do feel like the
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
fees would cover that um the cost of of
 
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
of this um as it's
 
02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
written Ju Just um even in the context
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
of a Cella type proposal you think
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
enough

02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
really it would really depend upon how
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
long that process went on right I mean
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
the we you know we have a have had an
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
application before us on a controversial
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
project two different applications for
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
six years now and there's been
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous interest in that so it has
 
02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
had a great a very significant impact on
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
staff time and our resources in the
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
agency I'm not sure that the solid waste
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
sighting evaluation committee as is
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
envisioned in hb2 would encounter the
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
same impacts on time that the department
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
has so well one of the benefits and and
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
I know we're getting short on time I
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
guess but uh you know one of the
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
benefits of having it at the end of the
 
02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:17.559 align:start position:0%
process rather than at the beginning is
 
02:14:20.669 --> 02:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
that these proposals are vetted we kind
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%
of know where things are at the
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
Departments and and state agencies have
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed them so it is at by that point
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
if it does get approved it's a
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
relatively solid proposal for this group
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
to look at one of the reasons why some
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
of those things have been in front of us
 
02:14:36.549 --> 02:14:36.559 align:start position:0%
for for some time is because of
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
incomplete applications and so um the
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
the the thought behind this was
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully they would have a more
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
complete applica or a a proposal would
 
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
have a more complete application by the
 
02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
time the state agencies are done with
 
02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
that process and then it would go to
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
this new entity represent Ms thank you U
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
would this committee have um oversight
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
for um Solid Waste incinerator or refu
 
02:15:05.599 --> 02:15:07.390 align:start position:0%
for um Solid Waste incinerator or refu
energy

02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
facility yes this would be any facility
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's a landfill an incinerator
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
or even a transfer facility that has a
 
02:15:18.189 --> 02:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
annual throughput of greater than
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow up and it is that specified in
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
the definitions I mean is it clear that
 
02:15:29.069 --> 02:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
that's what that that includes that it's
 
02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
a great question the definition is clear
 
02:15:34.030 --> 02:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
the um I I would note that um the the
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
term that's being defined is a major
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
solid waste disposal facility and it
 
02:15:41.069 --> 02:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
might be that it would be appropriate to
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
take the word disposal out of there and
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
just say major solid waste facility
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
because when you read the definition it
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
includes facilities that had collect
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
store treat transfer or dispose of waste
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
so the the the definition is correct the
 
02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
name of the term maybe could use a
 
02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:00.559 align:start position:0%
little take the disposal
 
02:16:02.669 --> 02:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
out representative
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
lean thanks Mr chairman maybe
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative evil can help me because
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm drawing a blank on the facility that
 
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
was such a controversial sighting up
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
north next to the lake yeah right Dalton
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's the cassella proposal
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
correct so I know that facility get that
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
whole thing is on hold are they subject
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
to these fees that you're proposing here
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
or is there separate fees that are
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
charged to people that are out there now
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
trying to get a site approved uh so they
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
so should this pass they you know if if
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
it has not gone through our process
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
which they do have a pending application
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
in front of us it's I want to be clear
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's not on hold it you know if this
 
02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
does include a moratorium which would
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
put such facilities on hold until the
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
new committee adopts rules but they
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
would be subject to this should this
 
02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:57.509 align:start position:0%
would be subject to this should this
pass

02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
before uh anything is approved at this
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
at the state agency level if that makes
 
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
sense yeah I follow thanks thanks Mr
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
chairman yes commissioner and quickly on
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
the adequacy of the the the the fees I
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
will remind the committee that the site
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee for energy covers
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
everything under the sun for an app for
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
facility this just covers the things
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
that my agency and other agencies aren't
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
covering so that so so the the workload
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
if you will though may be controversial
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
is much more is much smaller piece of
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
the pie if you will so that's the other
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
reason why we feel these fees are
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
adequate if that makes
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
sense all right uh very good so do we
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
have House Bill 215 I had her I had
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
Melissa C assigned assigned to to this
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
no it's not a is it a it just passed
 
02:17:54.429 --> 02:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
yesterday on
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
the it was on the consent calendar
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday and it um has it come to
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
finance is my question is it assigned to
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
consent it it's referred to finance
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday it was refer anyway all right
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
so good and and you mentioned two other
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
bills that are related what are those so
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
I I mean Adam if you want to I don't
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
know the N what is it one HB 171 I think
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
is the one on the moratorium and that
 
02:18:32.589 --> 02:18:32.599 align:start position:0%
came that that's correct HB 171 is
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative German's Bill
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
establishing a uh well I think it
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
originally came in as a 5-year
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
moratorium and the committee has uh I
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
looked I think looked to amend it to the
 
02:18:45.389 --> 02:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
three-year moratorium will beond next we
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
so it's still in process yeah or cor
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
whatever it's on the calendar for next
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
week next week it'll be exact I think
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
and there's also a Senate bill and then
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes the or well the uh yeah there is a
 
02:18:59.790 --> 02:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
Senate bill um and I its number escapes
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
me at the moment Senator rosf for's Bill
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
which also establishes a moratorium and
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
then uh I believe the other bill that
 
02:19:09.389 --> 02:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative eil was referring to was
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
hb77 that's representative Penza bill in
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
in housea and that that is actually
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
related to uh landfill setbacks and such
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
you know from very setbacks to surface
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
water water and other features so um I I
 
02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
don't and that I think is going to be
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
exact next week as well yeah I don't
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
understand Melissa does that have an
 
02:19:30.639 --> 02:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
understand Melissa does that have an
FN

02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
FN
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
707 well no okay it can't be an early
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
bill because yeah they're all done on it
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's right that's right following the
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
bouncing balls okay all right very good
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
so I guess we'll have to think about um
 
02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
this sort of stuff and I I try I'll try
 
02:19:50.439 --> 02:19:51.389 align:start position:0%
this sort of stuff and I I try I'll try
to

02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
yet we'll hear back from um
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron right
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah she could I did speak with her
 
02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
and she was sorry she couldn't make it
 
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
today okay all right good all right is
 
02:20:07.469 --> 02:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
there another second so so there are
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
some technical changes we're proposing
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the red lines to this uh we're we're
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
consolidating originally it's proposed
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
it's said they would have to hold a
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in every affected
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
municipality which is any where any
 
02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
truck traffic would go we felt that we
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
could make that you know you know one
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in that area because it's
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to be close enough to all
 
02:20:33.309 --> 02:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
go to that and then the committee will
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
have discretion to order additional
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
public hearings as necessary we just
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like uh you know proposals
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
coming through here needed to have TW
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know 20 different public hearings
 
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
for one proposal when they're all
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
relatively close together these towns so
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
um so there's that and then just some
 
02:20:54.670 --> 02:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
technical changes around um you know
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the moratorium would be for any new
 
02:20:59.070 --> 02:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
capacity the way it's worded now would
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
be any land landfill CH any change in
 
02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
ownership or anything like that I
 
02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
believe and so and Mike can speak to
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more but this would
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
just clarify that it's for any any new
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
capacity whether it's an expansion or or
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
new landfill or new waste
 
02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
facility yes that's right the uh the
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
current language was discovered by one
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
of our Engineers who are good at those
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
things they they read the rules and they
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
see what they mean um the way it's
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
worded right now we we administer our
 
02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
whole Solid Waste regulatory program
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
through a system of permits so even
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
after you get an approval to expand your
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
per your landfill for example you may
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
have three or four other permit
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
modifications you'll have to come in for
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
for final design approval uh change your
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
operating plan and such and the way it
 
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
was worded it made it sound like all of
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
those approvals would be held up for a
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
year um under the uh suspension which
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
was clearly not the intent I think of
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
the of the of the language so we just
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
clarified it to show that it's really
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the the issues that would come before
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee would only
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
be uh uh applications that sought to
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
provide uh expanded capacity or new
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
capacity or continued capacity for an
 
02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:09.790 align:start position:0%
capacity or continued capacity for an
existing

02:22:09.790 --> 02:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:22:13.710 --> 02:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
facility okay yes representative R yeah
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
I just want to confirm something um
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
regarding on your Redline document um
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh regarding those public hearings and
 
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
the public information center even
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
though they're going to be um for the
 
02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
municipality where the site is
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
proposed other community members from
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
neighboring communities would still be
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
invited to participate that's correct
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and in paragraph two again I I
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having the sections
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
connect to hb2 on this but um in
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 it does say the committee
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
May order the applicant to provide such
 
02:22:53.469 --> 02:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
additional public sessions in affected
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities as are reasonable to
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
inform the public of the proposed
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
project and so even if all the community
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
members or groups that that they
 
02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it that to that one public
 
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
hearing that they have the this
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee could order additional ones if
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
they felt that more needed to be done
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
there and so I we we felt that have
 
02:23:15.309 --> 02:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the jurisdiction or uh
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
yeah jurisdiction of the committee was
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
the was the right way to go on this
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
instead of requiring you know 15 to 20
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
public individual public hearings if
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
that makes makes sense yeah I I agree
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
with that my um concern is just to
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that people that may be in other
 
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
affected municipalities are aware of
 
02:23:34.830 --> 02:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
that public hearing they could travel to
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
the Imp you know to the municipality
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
where the sit's located similar Mr whims
 
02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
at the way we've done the Pas hearings
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
and Communications I me may be held in
 
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
marac but other community members are
 
02:23:50.429 --> 02:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
welcome to attend and provide cont
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
comment and ask questions I think we had
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
one in Lichfield absolutely you know
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
anytime we have a public information
 
02:23:58.030 --> 02:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
meeting or a public hearing it's it's
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
broadly advertised and we welcome
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to come and attend and
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's language in hp2 that provides
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
that effective municipalities absolutely
 
02:24:08.590 --> 02:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table to provide
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
their input not just citizens in those
 
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities but actually the local
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
government body as well all right thank
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
you okay all right shall we move ahead
 
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:21.550 align:start position:0%
you okay all right shall we move ahead
to

02:24:21.550 --> 02:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
um I think page 65 is it yes page 65 and
 
02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
so you'll it corresponds to the Chart uh
 
02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:33.469 align:start position:0%
so you'll it corresponds to the Chart uh
section

02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
156 that is a section to repeal in in
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
the 2023 budget we had two uh an
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation in FY 26 and an
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation FY 27 for the state aid
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
grant program it's a total of $30
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
million this is uh getting rid of those
 
02:24:57.389 --> 02:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
sections um and so that that saves $30
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
million for for the committee yeah you
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
prefunding Su Susan Carlson will be able
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
to speak to this a little bit more uh
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
but I believe the reason for that is
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
because this was an HB to appropriation
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
and so it didn't let me yeah yeah um
 
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
essentially this is these are
 
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that have not yet
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
happened okay so this um in hp2 from the
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
last session they they essentially
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated $15 million in 26 and $15
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
million in 27 so um the slide I gave you
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
um when we met last week was about what
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
we currently have as Appropriations this
 
02:25:51.870 --> 02:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
bium not what we are getting in the
 
02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:53.630 align:start position:0%
bium not what we are getting in the
future

02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay so I thought this this money was
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
on that slide no no it was not okay so
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
essent go ahead so essentially what is
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
happening is that the the uh sag as you
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
call it is being defunded
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
from well the appropriation was made for
 
02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
this by enum and now it's being that
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation is being repealed and so
 
02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
the 30 million I is going back to the
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
general fund is that correct under hp2
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
laws of 23 they have set up an
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the 26 27 BM and so
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
yes we're taking that we're asking that
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
that be taken so you're losing that
 
02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:36.349 align:start position:0%
that be taken so you're losing that
money

02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes but I want to be clear it's not
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
defunding the whole program it's just it
 
02:26:45.269 --> 02:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
is it's just defunding the future
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that were put in
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
hb2 as a result of I think there was a
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
larger Surplus last session than right
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there's not one in this
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
session so that's I think that's the
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
goal of that was to help balance and so
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
we we of course have a Buco Buck bill
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
for $15 million per well 30 million so
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway I get it yeah so we'll have to
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
talk about it yeah I will anyway so
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that sheet of paper you
 
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
gave us last time with all that leftover
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
money that's still there yes yes okay
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
represent them
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
mons you're good okay so to me this
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
particular section I I find it very
 
02:27:30.750 --> 02:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
disappointing because I think it should
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
apply to how fiscal year
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
25 and not fiscal year 26 and 27 this is
 
02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
leftover unspent
 
02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
money right
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
and we have a serious deficit in fiscal
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
year 25 and to say take from the rainy
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
day fund and let me spend this in 26 27
 
02:27:56.910 --> 02:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate okay would you agree
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay some I see some noding heads
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
anyways but huh spend it in 26 27 well
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's not going to be available for
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment projects by taking
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
the money isn't that the point no no no
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
but but because this is in houseu to
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
right and and if you read uh Melissa's
 
02:28:23.790 --> 02:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
note here it says $115 million increase
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
in general fund in fiscal year 26 and 27
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
so if you look at our um if you look at
 
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
our um Surplus statement right it's in
 
02:28:40.590 --> 02:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 1515 yes yeah yeah true so
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct because in 2023 it was
 
02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated to 26 and 27 so by
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
repealing it it falls into 26 and 27
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
right but I think it should be a 30 and
 
02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
right but I think it should be a 30 and
25

02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.309 --> 02:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
meany yeah over right so this is
 
02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
effectively let's take money out of the
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and spend it in 26 27
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's the way I look at it um so I
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
would like assuming we want to do it
 
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
which I I I guess we want to I mean it's
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
a you don't want to but no I don't know
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a big dollar amount that it is
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
a big dollar amount but it is a it's a
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
program to help with wastewater
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
treatment plant I mean you you guys can
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
say what it's for better than I can yeah
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we know what it's
 
02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
for but this total fund is hundreds of
 
02:29:43.150 --> 02:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
millions right I mean the amount in
 
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
these kind of projects yeah well we
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a fund well
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
there's yes the project there's people
 
02:29:52.990 --> 02:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
paying back and it's going back and
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
being loan out and yeah I mean the total
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
value right now in the Wastewater um sag
 
02:30:03.550 --> 02:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
program we're paying out on 174 projects
 
02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
the revolving
 
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
f it is not the revolving fund this is
 
02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
strictly a general fund
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation okay this pays again real
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
quickly I know know the chair
 
02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
understands he said but uh this is an
 
02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
after to the fact after the project is
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
completed and commissioned this helps
 
02:30:27.309 --> 02:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
pay debt
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
service okay yeah anyways but but it's
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
not yet been promised
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
anyway right that's corrected has not
 
02:30:40.349 --> 02:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
yet been promised okay all right so all
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
right I guess do we're not necessarily
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
in agreement so let's let's wait on
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
doing something with this line okay all
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
right let's go to uh
 
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
um section 158 on page
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
64 one 157 is just a small technical
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
change it I think we already decided
 
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
that one oh have you we're we're already
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
good with
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
157 okay that's what my note
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
says so we we're getting F two extra
 
02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.389 align:start position:0%
says so we we're getting F two extra
decimal

02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
decimal
 
02:31:11.399 --> 02:31:14.550 align:start position:0%
decimal
places

02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
um 158 uh this language repeals a fee on
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment system operators
 
02:31:23.230 --> 02:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh the bureau that administrates uh the
 
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
administers the fee does not receive any
 
02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
proceeds from the fees uh the fee
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
calculation is very arduous and often
 
02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
not calculated correctly by the folks
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
who submit it so it's more of a burden
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
than it is a benefit for the program and
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're proposing to to to
 
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
get rid of it is there is there a
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
general fund impact no
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right shall we anybody want to
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
should we approve this
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
make sense make a motion to approve I'll
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
second it
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right all those in favor
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
accepting section
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
158 okay very good
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
then section 159 so 159 this language
 
02:32:10.269 --> 02:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
repeals the out ofate Boer decal program
 
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
it was passed in 201 uh 19 and requires
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
a detail uh decal for the operation of
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
any out ofate watercraft the purpose was
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
to address uh the spread of invas of
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
aquatic uh species and organisms
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we found through this
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
process that the fee do not is not
 
02:32:30.910 --> 02:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue positive it's costing us more to
 
02:32:32.349 --> 02:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
administer the program than we actually
 
02:32:35.469 --> 02:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
bring in um so far the state spent
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
$75,000 on it and we've received a
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
little over 40,000 and so that's why
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
we're requesting for this one to be
 
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
repealed as well um I think our concern
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
is especially with these tight tight
 
02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
times that we're going into we want to
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're getting the best
 
02:32:53.309 --> 02:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
use of our our resources as possible and
 
02:32:54.990 --> 02:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to be administering
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
things that don't that are not Revenue
 
02:32:59.469 --> 02:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
positive okay representative evil yeah
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
just we have a letter here that I asked
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
Melissa to share with everyone it's from
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Lakes folks and um
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
they're they're opposing the repeal you
 
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
we should give you a cop yeah I haven't
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
seen a cop yet but I I have one here
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
guess so maybe we could talk about it a
 
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
little more they they do admit here that
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been Revenue positive yet but
 
02:33:27.550 --> 02:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
they were feeling like it would
 
02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
be yeah that's
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
what you have the letter Mr CH everybody
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
here right out of state voter decal
 
02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
y right you have the letter now I do
 
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
yes so I maybe we'd like an opportunity
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know what your thoughts are
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
maybe an opportunity to review this and
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
see where how they got to their
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
calculations but um our like I said our
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
feeling is that this has not been
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue positive um and I think our Our
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
concern is that it continue it will
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
continue to not be Revenue positive can
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
I ask you if it's doing anything about
 
02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:10.309 align:start position:0%
I ask you if it's doing anything about
invasive

02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
invasive
 
02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
species they don't have the money yet so
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
not now because it's costing us more so
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have any money to apply to that
 
02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's costing us more to actually bring
 
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the fees but but
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
oh but the fact that you get the decal
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean your boat's been inspected
 
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore it doesn't have any
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
invasive species sticking to it or
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
something like that is that
 
02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
no no no it's it's it's a purely
 
02:34:37.309 --> 02:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
administrative process you a decal right
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
I see okay representative
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
minds but I I guess I would ask the
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
question but is is the threat of
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
invasive species something we should be
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
a absolutely yes it is something to be
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about I think unfortunately
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
this specific fee we're not saying that
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's not um I think the specific fee
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here is that this fee
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
is not Revenue positive it's costing the
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
state money to administer it and that's
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
why we're proposing for it to be
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
repealed I know um I know it's not an
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
invasive species but I know
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative Rong has a separate bill
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
on license plates and and U CYO bacteria
 
02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
and other things like that so I guess
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
I'm confused so are we are we are we
 
02:35:26.110 --> 02:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
repealing the program
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
or the dcap decal just the decal and the
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
fee so the program still we're still
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to be yes checking for invasive
 
02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
okay under under under under the law New
 
02:35:41.269 --> 02:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters pay a boting
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
registration fee we currently get $99.50
 
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
from that Boer registration fee this is
 
02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
a decal a voluntary decal for out ofate
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
voters um to put a decal on their boats
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
um for this program what we have found
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
because this is um and we've had it run
 
02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
by a third party because it's an all
 
02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
online Pro program this one decal is not
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
making us any
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
money we are not eliminating program
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're not eliminating the instate fee
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's just this small decal program that
 
02:36:21.070 --> 02:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to eliminate that's costing
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
us money so are out ofate voters going
 
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
to have to pay
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
anything if we repeal
 
02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
this it sounded like they don't have to
 
02:36:33.309 --> 02:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
nowt volunt they don't have to but if
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's a problem why wouldn't we require
 
02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
out of state voters to pay something you
 
02:36:40.429 --> 02:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to give them a decal but just
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
make them well we can't force them to if
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're registered in their home state
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
we can't force them to re-register their
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
boat in our state
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
right right represent if you want rainy
 
02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
peler is here he can answer more
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
questions I I uh I think um Adam had a
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
good suggestion maybe you could take
 
02:37:03.389 --> 02:37:03.399 align:start position:0%
this back and and look at it I think New
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes was very um concerned
 
02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
that this potential Revenue stream for
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
them you know for this issue would be
 
02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
them you know for this issue would be
cut

02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
cut
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
off R they just look at it thank you Mr
 
02:37:18.269 --> 02:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
chair yeah especially with the cost of
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
the program I understand is that we're
 
02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
paying that third party
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
$225,000 because the department couldn't
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
process credit card payments for this
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
decal where now the department does have
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
that capability and so the the cost of
 
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
running it would go down um so I mean
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's one thing clarifying and also I'd
 
02:37:42.349 --> 02:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
be curious to why it made a you know if
 
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
you could clarify or confirm why it made
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
a profit in 2024 and not the other years
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah we'll wait to you for you to
 
02:37:52.349 --> 02:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
come back but those would be my
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
questions but they have to print and
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
mail out a thousand decals right I mean
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's the correct okay representative
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
wer well we could just as easily have
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
invasive species coming in on the Ducks
 
02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
geese there's not much we can do about
 
02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
that put a decal on them all right
 
02:38:14.070 --> 02:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative C representative C thank
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh correct me if I'm wrong
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
but uh to alleviate representative ms's
 
02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:20.269 align:start position:0%
but uh to alleviate representative ms's
concern

02:38:20.269 --> 02:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:38:22.590 --> 02:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
the uh Lakes Association has many
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
programs with local um uh water Lake
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
Associations and and uh volunteer groups
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
that monitor the uh invasive species
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
program and they do quite a good job as
 
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
as I know yes and and we we give them a
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
very healthy Grant in order to do that
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
to assist them with that program so this
 
02:38:48.750 --> 02:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
will actually give us a little more
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
money to be able to give more grants out
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay but follow up the um So currently
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
the and I'm aware of the grants that are
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
given uh that is currently done through
 
02:39:02.269 --> 02:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
the probably the $750 fee that we get
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
from our own and if this is a losing
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
program right now we're just taking
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
money away from that fund is that not
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct yeah and again
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
just to be clear the department is not
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting invasive species control is
 
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
something we want to get away from as
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
you allude to representative we'd rather
 
02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
any monies go to addressing that rather
 
02:39:26.110 --> 02:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
than to go to a vendor or go to a
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
sticker correct so thank you okay next
 
02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
one is
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh um section 160 line 17 repealing the
 
02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.469 --> 02:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
drinking so with the UN uncertainty of
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
federal funding and several other issues
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
we we're actually asking this was
 
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
something we proposed to the governor's
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
office they were kind enough to put it
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
into the to
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 um but we are asking for this
 
02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
language to be deleted um it's not
 
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
something that we feel is is prudent to
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
do at this time uh again with the
 
02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of some of the federal
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
funding uh going forward we want to make
 
02:40:11.469 --> 02:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
sure we have the revenue to be able to
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
um to pay for pay for staff in those
 
02:40:16.750 --> 02:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
programs that that do such great work on
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
safe safe drinking water so okay
 
02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:20.070 align:start position:0%
safe safe drinking water so okay
representative

02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I would at least like to
 
02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
look at the statute before I yeah okay
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll wait and go read the
 
02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
section Mr chairman before we go too far
 
02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:32.429 align:start position:0%
section Mr chairman before we go too far
beyond

02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
159 it does appear that if we can return
 
02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:36.750 align:start position:0%
159 it does appear that if we can return
another

02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:40:39.790 --> 02:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
$25,000 to the invasive species account
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
versus paying for a decal we could check
 
02:40:45.389 --> 02:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
this off by supporting the repeal So you
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're willing to vote for it I am no I
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
will second that motion
 
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
I just I feel bad because New Hampshire
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
Lakes had a different they've agreed to
 
02:40:58.269 --> 02:40:58.279 align:start position:0%
just look at it and they're very
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about it Mr chair yeah I I'm
 
02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
not ready to vote on it
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
because like the commissioner said we
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
should find out where they got these
 
02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
numbers because as of last year they
 
02:41:12.990 --> 02:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
were making money so if they're netting
 
02:41:15.389 --> 02:41:15.399 align:start position:0%
$4,000 that we wouldn't have otherwise
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
that could go to that
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
program that's something we should
 
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
report is m l Moro here no no she sent
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
the letter and um asked for it to be
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
distributed because she unfortunately
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here this afternoon I mean
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't take very long for
 
02:41:36.429 --> 02:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
you guys to just check it out we we can
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
check in with her and and get back to
 
02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
the committee by email if that's if
 
02:41:41.309 --> 02:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
that's all right okay thank you very
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
much okay we'll wait we'll wait all
 
02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:45.510 align:start position:0%
much okay we'll wait we'll wait all
right

02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:41:49.389 --> 02:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
now um let's go back to
 
02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
can you describe what's in section RSA
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
8 so that is that's the repeal of the um
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's not the Safe Drinking Water Act in
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
its entirety don't get me wrong it's
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
concern it is a it's a permit fee to
 
02:42:19.710 --> 02:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
operate uh for operators of drink water
 
02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
systems and we were seeking to to get
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
rid of this fee because it is arduous to
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
to administer similar to the Wastewater
 
02:42:31.389 --> 02:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
one but our it is revenue positive and I
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
guess and we do have a position on it
 
02:42:35.469 --> 02:42:35.479 align:start position:0%
and with the uh again with the
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of federal funding and where
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
that stands uh at the federal level we
 
02:42:42.190 --> 02:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we we are still
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
collecting Revenue to be able to pay for
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
those positions that do such good work
 
02:42:48.030 --> 02:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
on on public drinking water systems and
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
so um before we were we were not as
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about that now with the the
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
some of the federal stuff going on we
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we have that that
 
02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
um it brings in approximately
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
$128,000 which is enough to cover the
 
02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
cost of the position there's a position
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes there's a single position in
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
there and what do that the person just
 
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
collects the fees basically um yes they
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
collect the fees and and they do a lot
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
of other work yeah they do a lot they do
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of they work on the permits they
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
work on a variety of issues right
 
02:43:50.670 --> 02:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
they're very they they work with the
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
drinking water systems on on various
 
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
issues that they're having with any
 
02:43:57.790 --> 02:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
contamination uh other other issues as
 
02:43:59.710 --> 02:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
well so they they they have a variety of
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
hats if you will um they they they're
 
02:44:04.590 --> 02:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
very versatile uh but they are certainly
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
on this this this fee account um and our
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
our initial thought was to switch them
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
over to a federal account but given the
 
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
uncertainty we we want to delete this
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
language and retract retract it
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative R thank you Mr chair
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
um does this person also work with the
 
02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
lead drinking the municipal water or
 
02:44:32.110 --> 02:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
there's a program where I think Dees
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
reports every year or every other year
 
02:44:40.030 --> 02:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
about the uh lead that lead testing of
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
um public and private schools and Child
 
02:44:46.110 --> 02:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
Care Centers and I it's been a very
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
important program it actually identified
 
02:44:51.230 --> 02:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
some very very serious lead problems we
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
had in one of our elementary schools is
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
this person involved in that program
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
this person works with a variety of
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
programs in the drinking water Bureau um
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
that being one of them I mean that's a
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
that's a joint effort between DHHS and
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
and uh Dees but uh so so she does wear
 
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
many hats and and and does interact with
 
02:45:16.510 --> 02:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
that program as well as many others um
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
so so if if um
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
we maintain the repeal of that that's in
 
02:45:27.710 --> 02:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 would that detri detrimentally
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
affect that lead monitoring
 
02:45:33.070 --> 02:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
program we would have to move that pos
 
02:45:35.469 --> 02:45:35.479 align:start position:0%
position onto federal funds as I
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
understand it and that that could uh
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens at the federal
 
02:45:42.510 --> 02:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
level could have an effect on on that
 
02:45:44.790 --> 02:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
program again it's very uncertain what's
 
02:45:46.349 --> 02:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
happening at that at that level right
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
now there's there's uh various
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
legal actions and and things of that
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
nature happening and so we just want to
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
be safe on this one and and should we
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
not need this next session or even later
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
on in this session if we feel
 
02:46:02.309 --> 02:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving forward we we would
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
potentially come back and and maybe
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
propose it but I think at this time
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're just hoping to retract the
 
02:46:10.349 --> 02:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
you that's you maybe and not the
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
governor or we don't know uh we have not
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
on this specific one we have not but
 
02:46:19.389 --> 02:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
this is something that we we put forward
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
to them as a proposal I got and uh you
 
02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
changed your mind yes we have changed
 
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
our mind okay fine all right let's go to
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
161 so this one is uh it gives us the
 
02:46:34.349 --> 02:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
ability to work on uh Dam easements and
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
get easements for various uh for the
 
02:46:41.230 --> 02:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
horn horn pond dam and the um another
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
Dam in Conway to ensure that we have uh
 
02:46:48.190 --> 02:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
enough area to put our materials uh work
 
02:46:50.349 --> 02:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
with the Property Owners to get those
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
easements and so we do have one on the
 
02:46:55.230 --> 02:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
one change on the red line to add
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
another Dam and new I switch to this
 
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
list and and really the idea is to do an
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
easement for a dollar and that would
 
02:47:08.429 --> 02:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
allow us to put our um our materials and
 
02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
and and and basically work work near
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
that site um and have enough area there
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to perform the work that's
 
02:47:20.110 --> 02:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
needed I see so any problems with this
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
no okay yeah so why don't we approve it
 
02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
with the redline version where does the
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
money come from work
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
on uh so cap capital budget yeah capital
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
budget okay all right so representative
 
02:47:40.590 --> 02:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
Ms moves and representative rung seconds
 
02:47:43.469 --> 02:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
that we approved the redline version of
 
02:47:43.479 --> 02:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
that we approved the redline version of
section

02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
161 any any further discussion no all in
 
02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.429 align:start position:0%
161 any any further discussion no all in
favor

02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
favor
 
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
yeah are we going the have favor okay
 
02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
good so that yes ref um I'm prepared to
 
02:48:00.510 --> 02:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
accept the red line on the elimination
 
02:48:02.349 --> 02:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
of the drinking water operator permit
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
fee to instead of repealing that to to
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
keep that um in you know to to take that
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
repeal line out of
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 so that we're accepting de's
 
02:48:18.990 --> 02:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation I want to look at into
 
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
that one a little more okay yeah all
 
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
right let's go to so this one we
 
02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:26.110 align:start position:0%
right let's go to so this one we
accepted

02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
162 162 is proposing to change the uh
 
02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the waste management
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
division director uh right now it
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
requires a master's degree we're we're
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh proposing to bring it in line with
 
02:48:44.190 --> 02:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of our division directors to be
 
02:48:47.469 --> 02:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree um and that's and
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that is is supported by
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
the current Waste Management director
 
02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
are we okay with this yes I would uh
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
make a motion to accept uh 162 all right
 
02:49:00.510 --> 02:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
so moved in second U by representative
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
evil and representative rung to accept
 
02:49:05.710 --> 02:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
Section 162 while in
 
02:49:09.389 --> 02:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
favor yes all right one
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
opposed one
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
slow are you in favor he in favor okay
 
02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
good you mentally okay good all right so
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
we accepted that one 163 air
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
resources so next page yes so this one
 
02:49:29.950 --> 02:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh it it really is a a larger proposal
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
from 163 to uh 166 those those sections
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
um it eliminates the specific mentions
 
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
of uh membership organizations and
 
02:49:43.870 --> 02:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
associations and leaves it to the
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office to choose uh it it
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
still retains the requirements you know
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
if you're a public health expert or a
 
02:49:54.990 --> 02:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission member but it
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the associations having to
 
02:49:59.309 --> 02:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
nominate those positions and the reason
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
for that is because we've uh we we
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
haven't really found but the governor's
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
office in the past at least the past
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
governor's office I don't know if the
 
02:50:08.229 --> 02:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
new one has experienced it or not the
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
past governor's office has uh had issues
 
02:50:16.110 --> 02:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
with getting those associations to put
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
nominees up for them to potentially
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
accept and the number required so yeah
 
02:50:28.110 --> 02:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
so 163 164 165 and 166 these are all
 
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
changing characteristics of commissions
 
02:50:35.309 --> 02:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
and so on right so I I guess what I have
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
experienced and what I have heard
 
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
through the governor's office is that
 
02:50:42.110 --> 02:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
frequently it's a nightmare to find
 
02:50:44.349 --> 02:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
people to fill these positions and it's
 
02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
a lot easier if a if an organization
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
marches in the door and say he says here
 
02:50:54.950 --> 02:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
here's your name but so I didn't know
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
who generated the thought for this so
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the this came from not being able to
 
02:51:07.229 --> 02:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
get some of these associations to put
 
02:51:09.030 --> 02:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
forward a name some of them are very
 
02:51:13.389 --> 02:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
diligent some of them are not um and so
 
02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
that the thought was to do across the
 
02:51:17.550 --> 02:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
board you know eliminate the requirement
 
02:51:20.309 --> 02:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
then a specific Association put the put
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
forward these names that's not to say
 
02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
that the governor's office or whoever in
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's office is is searching
 
02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
for nominees for these would not work
 
02:51:31.469 --> 02:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
with those associations I think that's
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
probably where they'd go to First and
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
having been in the governor's office in
 
02:51:37.150 --> 02:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
the past that's often what we did for
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
things that didn't have a specific
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
Association attached to it but so but to
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
your point representative sometimes it
 
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
is a hindrance and sometimes it is a
 
02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
benefit um but in and I think you you
 
02:51:53.229 --> 02:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
have some experience and have heard that
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
some of these specifically to the
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
environmental councils have not been put
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
up nominations have not been put up and
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
some some of the reasons for that have
 
02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
been the associations have not been
 
02:52:06.990 --> 02:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
diligent but providing uh specific
 
02:52:11.229 --> 02:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
members uh or or individuals up for for
 
02:52:13.469 --> 02:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
nomination to the governor's office and
 
02:52:15.550 --> 02:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
so that was the intent of this well I
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
mean I think actually we have the same
 
02:52:19.870 --> 02:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
concern in and that is just trying to
 
02:52:21.990 --> 02:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
promptly fill these positions because
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's just been incredibly difficult and
 
02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
then just when I was Deputy speaker I
 
02:52:30.269 --> 02:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
would be elated if I came across
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
something that I had to a point where
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
the where an association had to name the
 
02:52:36.269 --> 02:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
person because I didn't have to go and
 
02:52:40.269 --> 02:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
find somebody but I mean you can try it
 
02:52:44.429 --> 02:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
and see if it works okay and and to be
 
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
clear we we try to have a pretty solid
 
02:52:48.910 --> 02:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
wall between us and the environmental
 
02:52:50.910 --> 02:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
councils because they are our appeals
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
venues and so we do our very best and
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
are very diligent about keeping a a
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
firewall between us and them and so um
 
02:53:01.790 --> 02:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know we we we don't want to be in
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
the position of being the ones to
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
recommend people for these positions
 
02:53:08.670 --> 02:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
frankly and and it has come down to that
 
02:53:11.070 --> 02:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
in some instances so I just I I think
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
one of the ideas here was to ensure that
 
02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
there was a an O more more available
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
candidates and more availability for the
 
02:53:20.269 --> 02:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
governor's office to do their due
 
02:53:21.870 --> 02:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
diligence on some on some of this
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
instead of having to rely on a specific
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
organization to make a recommendation
 
02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see in some of these often
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
times it's multiple organizations and
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
they have to put up multiple nominees
 
02:53:35.550 --> 02:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
and that becomes a an intense
 
02:53:37.229 --> 02:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
proposition I'll put put it that way all
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
right represent Ms um I I have a I have
 
02:53:44.229 --> 02:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a problem um
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
listing um as required Representatives
 
02:53:51.750 --> 02:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh representatives from the uh the oil
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
industry and the natural gas
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
industry um without mentioning you know
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy industry I mean I
 
02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
would like to see something that says
 
02:54:04.190 --> 02:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
you know one member from the renewable
 
02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:06.150 align:start position:0%
you know one member from the renewable
energy

02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
industry since the renewable we talking
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
about this is on
 
02:54:13.469 --> 02:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
163 since you know one of the benefits
 
02:54:16.030 --> 02:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy is that it does um
 
02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:22.910 --> 02:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
so those are the existing members of the
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
council um that would be a policy
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
position for this committee to make I I
 
02:54:31.150 --> 02:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
don't know that we we have a position to
 
02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
take on that um we were specifically for
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
the public health uh position you'll see
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
that there's a strike through there and
 
02:54:41.469 --> 02:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
just it says just in the field of Public
 
02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
Health it's been many years since we
 
02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
filled that specific position we haven't
 
02:54:46.429 --> 02:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
been able to find anyone with these
 
02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications and neither as the
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office and so we we felt that
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
it was important that we find someone to
 
02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
sit on this Council and so that's that's
 
02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's office find someone to
 
02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
sell in this Council rather and that
 
02:55:01.269 --> 02:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
that requirement be paired back a little
 
02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
bit so that it's not as difficult to
 
02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:04.110 align:start position:0%
bit so that it's not as difficult to
find

02:55:04.110 --> 02:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
find
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
a a unicorn if you will representative R
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um I apologize
 
02:55:14.590 --> 02:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
that um I'm I'm looking back for more
 
02:55:17.550 --> 02:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
basic information but I understand what
 
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying that these councils are an
 
02:55:23.790 --> 02:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
appeals provide appeals venue for um
 
02:55:27.150 --> 02:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
permitting correct what other value if
 
02:55:31.710 --> 02:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
any do they provide to Dees so we do
 
02:55:33.229 --> 02:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
I'll let the commissioner speak to this
 
02:55:36.269 --> 02:55:36.279 align:start position:0%
but we do uh run our rules by these
 
02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
councils so we go there and we provide
 
02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
our Draft rules to them and they provide
 
02:55:43.630 --> 02:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
input these are the industry experts in
 
02:55:45.150 --> 02:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh these specific Fields so there's the
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
waste Council Waste Management Council
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
which is so you know solid waste
 
02:55:50.670 --> 02:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste those types of things
 
02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
there's the air Resources Council which
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
is experts in as you'll see here uh
 
02:55:57.229 --> 02:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
different industries that have to do
 
02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
with air permitting and air uh things
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
that have to affect air emissions
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's the wetlands Council which is uh
 
02:56:07.870 --> 02:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
you know our Wetlands experts and then
 
02:56:09.389 --> 02:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
there's the water Council which deals
 
02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
with uh anything that's not wetlands in
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
the within the Water Division and so
 
02:56:15.469 --> 02:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
these are really the industry I I say
 
02:56:17.429 --> 02:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
all that these are the industry experts
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
they do provide good advice to us in in
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
our sounding board when we do do rule
 
02:56:26.229 --> 02:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
Mak um so they do provide a benefit um
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
but you know I I I guess that's what I'd
 
02:56:32.429 --> 02:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
say about it and I'll let yeah okay
 
02:56:32.439 --> 02:56:33.590 align:start position:0%
say about it and I'll let yeah okay
thank

02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:56:36.750 --> 02:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
you chair could I just make a comment so
 
02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:37.710 align:start position:0%
you chair could I just make a comment so
in

02:56:37.710 --> 02:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
hb2 for the previous bium the uh go
 
02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu at the time recommended
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
that these councils become simply
 
02:56:51.469 --> 02:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
advisory as I recall and um what
 
02:56:55.469 --> 02:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
happened during the during the uh
 
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
process they retained The Advisory part
 
02:57:03.630 --> 02:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
uh for questions of fact right they were
 
02:57:05.790 --> 02:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
determined for questions of fact but
 
02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
they have somebody from the AG for
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
questions of law I think they bifurcated
 
02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
it that's how it ended up and then there
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
was just a study committee that just
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
completed a look at these environmental
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
councils and they decided to just leave
 
02:57:22.030 --> 02:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
them alone but your question is good I
 
02:57:24.070 --> 02:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a different kind of an
 
02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
app pellet format than a lot of agencies
 
02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah one other I'm sorry so um with
 
02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
the with their appeals responsibility if
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
does that still allow the um the the the
 
02:57:44.710 --> 02:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
permit te to go to let's say Superior
 
02:57:47.070 --> 02:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
Court if they disagree with the decision
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
of the council so goes to the Supreme
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
Court after the after the council so it
 
02:57:53.550 --> 02:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
goes it's a direct route to the Supreme
 
02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
Court okay thank
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
you so I I guess I'm okay with um moving
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
one of
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
the uh public interest one of the
 
02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
general public numbers to a to a
 
02:58:11.309 --> 02:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
renewable uh generating industry type if
 
02:58:11.319 --> 02:58:16.469 align:start position:0%
renewable uh generating industry type if
you

02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
want I mean the other thing you could do
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
I was thinking we have Reggie and all
 
02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
these things right so well you could
 
02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
combine the representative for oil and
 
02:58:30.150 --> 02:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
natural gas into one person and then
 
02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
just replace one of them with renewable
 
02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but those are very different kinds
 
02:58:38.670 --> 02:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
of things they're not they're not really
 
02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
the same I will remind the committee
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
these are existing positions people in
 
02:58:43.399 --> 02:58:44.229 align:start position:0%
these are existing positions people in
these

02:58:44.229 --> 02:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
positions um so I just providing that
 
02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.389 --> 02:58:55.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and if I could also again we
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't have an objection per se but
 
02:59:00.550 --> 02:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see the change here in line four
 
02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
on six page 66 so the current language
 
02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
says it has to be a steam power electric
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
generating uh that's being made more
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
generic so it's electric generating I
 
02:59:13.950 --> 02:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
would presume in the context you're
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about a renewable would be would
 
02:59:19.710 --> 02:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
qualify too so there's a potential that
 
02:59:22.510 --> 02:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
that could just be all encompassing so
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
but what were you saying Mr chair so I
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
said obviously they can't find anybody
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
who does steam right because no who
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
uses that actually was historically the
 
02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
old PSNH plants and and now the
 
02:59:39.349 --> 02:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
successors successor owners yeah but
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's I mean conquer got rid
 
02:59:44.110 --> 02:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
of conquer Steam and all right actually
 
02:59:46.110 --> 02:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
it's we're talking about uh marac
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
station or Schiller station are the two
 
02:59:51.429 --> 02:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
that that qualify so so it's on the way
 
02:59:54.630 --> 02:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
out so anyways no I was
 
02:59:56.990 --> 02:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
saying it wouldn't bother me if we
 
02:59:58.990 --> 02:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's six people here who are
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
general public or something
 
03:00:05.790 --> 03:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
right so yeah so take make it five and
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's great how about that
 
03:00:12.590 --> 03:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay
 
03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay
so

03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so represent Ms and and Melissa can
 
03:00:20.190 --> 03:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
work out the actual language and we'll
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.590 --> 03:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
righta wer I'll I'll make sure I say one
 
03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:29.590 align:start position:0%
righta wer I'll I'll make sure I say one
tree

03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
tree
 
03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
hugging representative of the renewable
 
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
energy yeah I mean this is going to be
 
03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:36.850 align:start position:0%
one person out of 12 or
 
03:00:36.850 --> 03:00:39.309 align:start position:0%
one person out of 12 or
[Laughter]

03:00:39.309 --> 03:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
something all right let's move on to 164
 
03:00:46.229 --> 03:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
any problems with that
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
one same kind of stuff
 
03:00:52.030 --> 03:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so 163 to 166 are all the same sort
 
03:00:55.269 --> 03:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
of concept there when you move through
 
03:00:55.279 --> 03:00:57.150 align:start position:0%
of concept there when you move through
them

03:00:57.150 --> 03:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:01:00.670 --> 03:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
yeah can we approve that one yeah to ask
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
so so the thing about having the vice
 
03:01:05.710 --> 03:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
chair assume the duties of the chair you
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
confirm conform that with all the
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
councils that's that's correct it's to
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
just bring those in
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
line I um I just want to say that the
 
03:01:18.349 --> 03:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes did object to the
 
03:01:22.190 --> 03:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
change here but I'm just didn't or did
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay on 165 yeah well replacing the uh a
 
03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
power of the organizations to name
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
someone I think it's just out of concern
 
03:01:38.399 --> 03:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
someone I think it's just out of concern
that

03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:41.950 --> 03:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
there's I should say complete
 
03:01:44.110 --> 03:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
representation right they are one of the
 
03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
organizations being that are being
 
03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
deleted deleted out of the statute yeah
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
I have a question Mr chair have have has
 
03:01:54.190 --> 03:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes been have you had an
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
nominee we do have one on the council
 
03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
now okay but it took a while to fill it
 
03:02:08.389 --> 03:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
did take some time to
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
fill yeah I I would be
 
03:02:15.150 --> 03:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
um I would be opposed of just making
 
03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:15.870 align:start position:0%
um I would be opposed of just making
that

03:02:15.870 --> 03:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
deletion um but I would I would um offer
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
if if if it was the um sentiment of the
 
03:02:27.150 --> 03:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
majority to go to delete that I would
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
prefer to have it replaced with and one
 
03:02:31.630 --> 03:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
shall represent an a lake a New
 
03:02:34.750 --> 03:02:34.760 align:start position:0%

could say one represent New Hampshire
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
lakes or you could say New Hampshire
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
Lake Association yes so just a Lake
 
03:02:49.870 --> 03:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
Association or Watershed Association
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
would would do just say saying they're
 
03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative New Hampshire Lakes you
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
could have any have anybody yeah I
 
03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:01.030 align:start position:0%
could have any have anybody yeah I
see

03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
rers I know so what about what let's
 
03:03:06.670 --> 03:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
let's start with 164 any problems with
 
03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:08.830 align:start position:0%
let's start with 164 any problems with
that

03:03:08.830 --> 03:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
one because this is your thing this is
 
03:03:14.229 --> 03:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Waste
 
03:03:16.229 --> 03:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
Management are you are you on this
 
03:03:19.349 --> 03:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
Council no I am not okay I don't fit any
 
03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:21.310 align:start position:0%
category and they would
 
03:03:21.310 --> 03:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
category and they would
[Music]

03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
03:03:30.750 --> 03:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
mean the the if the deletion of the nrra
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know how we could when it's uh
 
03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
but well it says I don't know
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
communities which recycle or
 
03:03:40.349 --> 03:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
recover Solid Waste representing the
 
03:03:40.359 --> 03:03:44.790 align:start position:0%
recover Solid Waste representing the
public

03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
interest I don't know what I would
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
replace that with it quarter pass
 
03:03:53.710 --> 03:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
four I don't know I Mr whims do you can
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
you think of somebody that would
 
03:03:57.550 --> 03:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin okay I I'd like
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
to just make a general comment that this
 
03:04:02.990 --> 03:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
is the governor's
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
proposal right she she's the executive
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
the state she manages the state I'm not
 
03:04:12.670 --> 03:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
sure that we should be down in the weeds
 
03:04:15.389 --> 03:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
at the level we're at particularly where
 
03:04:19.229 --> 03:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
there's little or no Financial impact
 
03:04:21.910 --> 03:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
I think we have to move on okay and
 
03:04:24.030 --> 03:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
approve these
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
sections all right well I mean we could
 
03:04:28.269 --> 03:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
take a
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
vote but it it is our responsibility I
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
mean we are a separate branch of
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
government I think it is these I think
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
my my constituents anyim mate would
 
03:04:42.269 --> 03:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
expect me to review this since it is
 
03:04:46.590 --> 03:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
presented to us okay all right so on on
 
03:04:48.429 --> 03:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
Section 164
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative eel moves that we accept
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
Section 164 second and representative
 
03:04:57.870 --> 03:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
cell seconds all those in
 
03:05:00.750 --> 03:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
favor okay good we got
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
one um
 
03:05:06.389 --> 03:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
except okay now
 
03:05:09.229 --> 03:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
165 we had some some
 
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement on the lake one I mean I
 
03:05:14.670 --> 03:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
think it's I think they were just going
 
03:05:17.830 --> 03:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
through and removing the names of
 
03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
organizations without like really study
 
03:05:23.790 --> 03:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
so I think you could even do that shall
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire River councils
 
03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
or something like that or just leave
 
03:05:31.349 --> 03:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
Rivers alone but Lakes I really do I
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
mean you could have somebody that
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
represents boers if they're from Lakes
 
03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
maybe write interests River interests or
 
03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:41.349 align:start position:0%
maybe write interests River interests or
lakes

03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
interests they they they like
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
associations I
 
03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
guess just say um shall represent New
 
03:05:53.110 --> 03:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall represent a New
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire River Association or represent
 
03:05:58.710 --> 03:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Lake Association yeah I
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:04.190 --> 03:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
that no the ones that are cross out are
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
specific organizations they're they're
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
have bylaws they're you know so I I
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
think if we make a generic Association
 
03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it still need we're all
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.469 --> 03:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
Association or
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
Council just keep it generic yeah
 
03:06:30.110 --> 03:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
generic okay and a Lakes Association
 
03:06:34.510 --> 03:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
right okay um I'd like to move that we
 
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh accept
 
03:06:39.950 --> 03:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
165 subject to the
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
changes regarding the adding the word
 
03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
River I mean Association after rivers
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
and after after LS
 
03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and probably insert the word a
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
as appropriate make it grammatically
 
03:06:59.229 --> 03:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
correct okay do we do we understand what
 
03:07:01.870 --> 03:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
we're voting on here section 165 are you
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
seconding this she second represent Rong
 
03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
second okay all those in favor yes okay
 
03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
good all right 165
 
03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
Melissa what's that Melissa do you want
 
03:07:22.710 --> 03:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
to um vote on to go back 163 as amended
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
by the language that we discussed
 
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
instead of keeping it as an open item I
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
thought we didn't quite have language
 
03:07:30.190 --> 03:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
yet you think we can say renewable
 
03:07:32.269 --> 03:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
energy member and reduce the public
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
member to
 
03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
five okay good all right ready for 163
 
03:07:44.229 --> 03:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
add the renewable reduce the public
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
member okay so that's moved by
 
03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative months and second I'll
 
03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
second it by representative Cals all
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
those in
 
03:07:55.229 --> 03:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
favor we're going to add the renewable
 
03:07:58.670 --> 03:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
member renewable energy somebody
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
representing renewable energy industry
 
03:08:04.190 --> 03:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay yes because because all these
 
03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
things are industry one no vote okay
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
okay one no vote okay
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
good all right
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
now down to um accept
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
see and yeah I mean look at this the
 
03:08:39.229 --> 03:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
general they they have to submit three
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
names of which the governor picks one
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:49.389 --> 03:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.469 --> 03:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
I'm okay we're okay with this okay rep
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative moves representative cell
 
03:08:59.070 --> 03:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
seconds yes we accept second it R
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
section 166 all those in
 
03:09:07.830 --> 03:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
favor yes okay unanimous okay
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
accept Okay now
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
167 a water management Flowage fee so
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
one 67 and 168 are increasing the annual
 
03:09:24.630 --> 03:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
registration fee for dams by 10% and
 
03:09:26.429 --> 03:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
creating a CPI
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh that will that will be
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
done every year on on those fees um and
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's doing the same thing for the dam
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
permitting fees um in 168 and
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
so that we we'll be we'll be giving you
 
03:09:45.389 --> 03:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
as part of the or we have given you as
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
part of that homework assignment you
 
03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
gave us around fee increases to offset
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
General funds that's one of the things
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we'll address but this is a so this
 
03:09:55.950 --> 03:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
is a 10% in order to offset more
 
03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
positions it would have to be 100% but
 
03:10:01.550 --> 03:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's something that we
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
provided as part of consideration but so
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's what those two sections do there
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
though it's it's a 10%
 
03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
regular it's a regular CPI adjustment
 
03:10:15.150 --> 03:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:18.349 --> 03:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
2027 yes I'm sorry represent a month
 
03:10:21.229 --> 03:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
when when was the last time that fee was
 
03:10:21.239 --> 03:10:24.590 align:start position:0%
when when was the last time that fee was
adjusted

03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
2007 have you looked at what the
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
inflation's been since then and is that
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
why you pick the no it's way more than
 
03:10:34.830 --> 03:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
10% it's it's it's more than 10% I I
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
think you know this this is something
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
that that we we express just issues
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
generally with with fee funds uh to the
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
governor's office and and you know there
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
are many agencies going to them with v
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
increases so I think they had said you
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
know we're we're willing to do 10% here
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
um you know but that's so that's that's
 
03:10:57.510 --> 03:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
kind of where we're
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
at oh it's not one of the ones on this
 
03:11:03.389 --> 03:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
paper yeah it's not so so you're this is
 
03:11:05.309 --> 03:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
the fee you're recommending there's not
 
03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
a difference so just to be clear on the
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's two matrices the one that has
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
the hb2 language and changes that's the
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
10% on the page that we gave you that's
 
03:11:17.469 --> 03:11:17.479 align:start position:0%
part of the homework assignment you gave
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
us to say to offset we're not proposing
 
03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
anything per se but it's it was we asked
 
03:11:25.469 --> 03:11:25.479 align:start position:0%
for it it was to address it was to
 
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
address your your your request so so
 
03:11:32.429 --> 03:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
does this fee as is bring in 1.3 million
 
03:11:33.349 --> 03:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
all these
 
03:11:42.670 --> 03:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh you turn on the sorry apologize um
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
yes um currently they bring in a little
 
03:11:52.830 --> 03:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars over the
 
03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
bani okay so where is the one point am I
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the right line Dam
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
registration and permitting fees if we
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
fee okay it would offset $1.3 million in
 
03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
fee okay it would offset $1.3 million in
general

03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
funds at 10% it adds around
 
03:12:15.630 --> 03:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
$130,000 or 60,000 a year or $60,000 a
 
03:12:15.640 --> 03:12:18.150 align:start position:0%
$130,000 or 60,000 a year or $60,000 a
year

03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:12:19.870 --> 03:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
I mean in In
 
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
fairness the the cost to the agency over
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
time is more than just inflation I mean
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
you have Personnel you have benefits you
 
03:12:30.269 --> 03:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
have all kinds of things so I think
 
03:12:32.590 --> 03:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
something more than just an inflation
 
03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:34.670 align:start position:0%
something more than just an inflation
rate

03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
rate
is

03:12:37.110 --> 03:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate yes representative Le I
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly support the inflation
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
rate but if I'm looking at 167 168 169
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
you have have the uh cost of living
 
03:12:52.030 --> 03:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment based on the Department of
 
03:12:55.349 --> 03:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
Labor or it successor now in other items
 
03:12:58.269 --> 03:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
we've had any fee increases subject to
 
03:13:00.670 --> 03:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
oversight of the fiscal committee
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
so if these fees are going up to much
 
03:13:05.550 --> 03:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
you know nationally but maybe not here
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire as far as the cost of
 
03:13:09.750 --> 03:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
living I do think the fiscal committee
 
03:13:11.950 --> 03:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
should have the final say like we do
 
03:13:14.110 --> 03:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
with Canon Mountain if they look for an
 
03:13:16.910 --> 03:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
increase in ticket okay tickets that's a
 
03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:17.790 align:start position:0%
increase in ticket okay tickets that's a
good

03:13:17.790 --> 03:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
add fiscal committee so so like annually
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
they could give you the fee schedule and
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
you would then it would just have to be
 
03:13:26.469 --> 03:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved sure because
 
03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
whoever the successor may be too you
 
03:13:32.429 --> 03:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
sure sure okay represent R it doesn't
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
add so um to M to representative
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
Lehman's point so we would be adding an
 
03:13:41.950 --> 03:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
addition to this adjustment of review or
 
03:13:43.630 --> 03:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
it would be contingent on approval by
 
03:13:48.030 --> 03:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee yes the annual
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
increase or by annual or whatever
 
03:13:54.670 --> 03:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm throwing this out there but um
 
03:13:57.870 --> 03:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
one change I would prefer to see on line
 
03:14:03.309 --> 03:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
12 and in any and where that Clause is
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
it follows um I'm on page 68 on line 12
 
03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
where it says shall be
 
03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
increased I'd prefer to just say shall
 
03:14:14.830 --> 03:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
be adjusted annually and then by the
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
percentage change mhm I mean I guess
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's wishful thinking to think that the
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:30.469 --> 03:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
might yeah you could you know pigs may
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah was your grandfather in I so I
 
03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up did did you say
 
03:14:44.110 --> 03:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of agencies are bringing fee
 
03:14:47.469 --> 03:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
alteration requests
 
03:14:49.910 --> 03:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that there are other
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
agencies bringing I don't know how many
 
03:14:54.030 --> 03:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know in what magnitude I
 
03:14:55.630 --> 03:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
just know that there are other agencies
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
bringing up fee requests and so I I
 
03:15:00.990 --> 03:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
think you
 
03:15:03.710 --> 03:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
know they this this was a this was a
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
number that that we worked with them on
 
03:15:08.670 --> 03:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's part of the the 10 yeah the
 
03:15:12.510 --> 03:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
10% was and then you know as part of the
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
exercise that you gave us we provided
 
03:15:16.229 --> 03:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
the 100% just to show you what it would
 
03:15:18.269 --> 03:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
look like if chose to go that row what
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
if we made it connected to the budget
 
03:15:23.229 --> 03:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
that is by anually on odd-numbered years
 
03:15:23.239 --> 03:15:25.670 align:start position:0%
that is by anually on odd-numbered years
July

03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
1st you could you could certainly do
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
that um so that instead of every two
 
03:15:31.950 --> 03:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
yeah instead of every year every two
 
03:15:34.349 --> 03:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
years yeah yeah I
 
03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
mean any way you you you want to slice
 
03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
it I'm not sure that this is uh a
 
03:15:42.030 --> 03:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
typical uh language in it in other
 
03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
pieces of statue um but so I think it's
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
the the world Royster on this one okay
 
03:15:52.030 --> 03:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
yeah cuz cuz that way it's you're only
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
doing it half as often but also
 
03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
connected with coming up with the next
 
03:15:59.590 --> 03:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
budget you think okay the fees is going
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
to such and such right and I will say
 
03:16:03.229 --> 03:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
the one of the points to doing this is
 
03:16:05.469 --> 03:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
not to have a sticker shock and a big
 
03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
you know just to maintain yeah but
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's probably not that much no I
 
03:16:11.189 --> 03:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
agree in a two-year cycle I'm not
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
worried about that at all that was the
 
03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
only thing I was going to mention I mean
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
that you know I I like the Elegance of
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
what you proposing it's just that
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
instead of it going up smoothly you're
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to get this ratchet effect okay
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
all right I'm just trying to make less
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
work for you know so all right I'll I'll
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
work on rewriting this uh these various
 
03:16:35.429 --> 03:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
sections okay
 
03:16:39.229 --> 03:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
good so
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
rewrite so these are all fee sections
 
03:16:44.910 --> 03:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
here okay anything where are we going
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
from here what's next in the last
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
section is 169 for us that we believe is
 
03:16:51.469 --> 03:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
relevant to us is that's the subsurface
 
03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
which is septic fee increases I should
 
03:16:56.349 --> 03:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
note that the governor's office um
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was a typo in this
 
03:17:00.269 --> 03:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
section they wanted to do a 10% fee
 
03:17:03.189 --> 03:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
increase and this is currently a 50% fee
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
increase um so there there was a typo
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
there um I will mention that as the
 
03:17:14.670 --> 03:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
current trajectory is an FY 27 or FY 28
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're projecting a um a NE not a
 
03:17:22.469 --> 03:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
negative balance in in the subsurface
 
03:17:26.349 --> 03:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
account and so um you know a fee
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
increase would would be beneficial on on
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is this on your list here or no no
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
no so it's not on the proposed fee list
 
03:17:37.630 --> 03:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
because it's not dependent on General
 
03:17:41.710 --> 03:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
funds um it is on the Matrix that has
 
03:17:45.229 --> 03:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
the Staple in it um and that's we don't
 
03:17:48.269 --> 03:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
have any technical changes to that
 
03:17:48.279 --> 03:17:49.870 align:start position:0%
have any technical changes to that
provision

03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
provision
 
03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:52.790 align:start position:0%
provision
ni

03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
ni
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.269 --> 03:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
people and I will add assuming the 50%
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a moment uh that how that was drived
 
03:18:12.189 --> 03:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
at is Phil can correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
the fees hadn't been increased in
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
statute since 2009 if you applied the
 
03:18:16.279 --> 03:18:18.630 align:start position:0%
statute since 2009 if you applied the
CPI

03:18:18.630 --> 03:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
CPI
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
as you were talking if it had been
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
applied that's where you end up so this
 
03:18:24.750 --> 03:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
is not like an expansion of the program
 
03:18:26.710 --> 03:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
this is basically the program trying to
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
keep up with the cost of living ETA
 
03:18:30.070 --> 03:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
which is what we're trying to do but
 
03:18:33.189 --> 03:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
this is back to my original point about
 
03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
you have a you have a licensed septic
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
designer who does a test pit and creates
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
a septic design and now is going to pay
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
you an extra
 
03:18:49.630 --> 03:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
no it's not that expensive yes it is oh
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
my gosh to do atic to do a septic design
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's well for the for the
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
right design um depends on the type of
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
design more typically around
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
3,000 right okay but still it needs a
 
03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
very good review I mean this is
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
right yeah the as the commissioner said
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh the we did look at the CPI since 2009
 
03:19:26.790 --> 03:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
when the fees were last changed and we
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
also looked at the construction cost
 
03:19:31.469 --> 03:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
index which increased also CPI would be
 
03:19:31.479 --> 03:19:32.710 align:start position:0%
index which increased also CPI would be
exactly

03:19:32.710 --> 03:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:19:36.030 --> 03:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
50% uh to get to to catch up for the
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
inflation and construction cost index is
 
03:19:39.189 --> 03:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
more like
 
03:19:41.630 --> 03:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
70% so we were looking at a way to
 
03:19:45.150 --> 03:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
rightsize the fees to basically catch up
 
03:19:47.309 --> 03:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
um with the inflation from where we were
 
03:19:49.710 --> 03:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
from 2009 and then with the CPI
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment year-over-year to to stay
 
03:19:55.950 --> 03:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
caught up so why isn't this General
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
funds this is just like any of our other
 
03:20:00.910 --> 03:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
permits where it's fee for service oh I
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
see okay and so there's a dedicated fund
 
03:20:05.309 --> 03:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
or not there's a there's a fund part it
 
03:20:06.990 --> 03:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
goes into the water resources fund but
 
03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is you know the this is the part of
 
03:20:10.670 --> 03:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
it relative to subsurface permanence I
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
see which deals with septic systems and
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
subdivisions gotcha and our our model on
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
this indicated that um we will
 
03:20:24.189 --> 03:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
be um in most recent year we are running
 
03:20:28.389 --> 03:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
a deficit and sort of a net operating
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
deficit of
 
03:20:32.469 --> 03:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
200,000 uh next year we predict about a
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
million dollar deficit um and you know
 
03:20:38.590 --> 03:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
by at at that burn rate relative to our
 
03:20:41.469 --> 03:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
balance we expect to be um negative
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
balance in FY
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
27 that's a lot of money
 
03:20:50.429 --> 03:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
so do you P the employees out of the
 
03:20:52.189 --> 03:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
water fund oh yeah this this pays for
 
03:20:54.030 --> 03:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
all of the Personnel costs all the
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
benefits all of the uh indirect costs
 
03:20:57.870 --> 03:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
also direct costs so not to jump ahead
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
but this is the kind of thing we're
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about with the solid waste
 
03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
management fund to have some of the fees
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
help def Fray the Staffing costs within
 
03:21:12.429 --> 03:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
that Bureau so it's the same
 
03:21:17.189 --> 03:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
idea yeah okay
 
03:21:20.349 --> 03:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
Pro um no we want to maybe change it to
 
03:21:22.510 --> 03:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
by annual so we're going to wait on this
 
03:21:26.110 --> 03:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
one okay all right thank you all
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
gentlemen and
 
03:21:30.750 --> 03:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
ladies for coming yes represent can I
 
03:21:32.590 --> 03:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
can I ask one question
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
um um is there any source of
 
03:21:38.309 --> 03:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
funding uh
 
03:21:43.189 --> 03:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere to assist the the department in
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
the work it has to do to kind of oversee
 
03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
closed landfills and and perhaps help
 
03:21:49.960 --> 03:21:52.870 align:start position:0%
closed landfills and and perhaps help
with

03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:55.389 --> 03:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
remediation yes there there is and and
 
03:21:58.990 --> 03:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
director whims can can uh speak to that
 
03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:02.830 align:start position:0%
director whims can can uh speak to that
more

03:22:02.830 --> 03:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
intelligently well I'm not I'm not sure
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
what the assist commissioner is
 
03:22:08.710 --> 03:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
referring to I if I understand your
 
03:22:10.110 --> 03:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
question you're asking is there a source
 
03:22:13.030 --> 03:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
of funding available to the department
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
to oversee for to defay its cost for
 
03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
overseeing closed online landfills yeah
 
03:22:19.830 --> 03:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
and let me just be more clear I mean you
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
know there's a landfill gets closed and
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's you know one in my area that you
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
know director whims and I have talked
 
03:22:31.830 --> 03:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
about quite a bit um and um while the
 
03:22:33.510 --> 03:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
the previous operators and maybe the
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
towns have some responsibility the
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
department has a pretty significant role
 
03:22:41.229 --> 03:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
and is there any source of funding to
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of that the current
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
source of funding to cover the cost of
 
03:22:46.830 --> 03:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
that is the general fund the entire
 
03:22:48.349 --> 03:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste program for New Hampshire
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
Dees is is General funded there's no
 
03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
federal money for that there's no
 
03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
it is there any is there any would there
 
03:23:01.630 --> 03:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
be any way to to to to collect a fee
 
03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
from maybe the the prior owners the
 
03:23:07.510 --> 03:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
prior users of the of the um landfill
 
03:23:10.269 --> 03:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
who are going someplace else now the
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
majority of those closed online
 
03:23:13.950 --> 03:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
landfills are municipally owned so if
 
03:23:15.189 --> 03:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
there were going to be a fee it would
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to be collected from municip IP
 
03:23:20.830 --> 03:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
alties um I mean we've you know
 
03:23:23.550 --> 03:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
discussed in Broad terms with this
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
committee um the concept of a solid
 
03:23:30.429 --> 03:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
waste disposal search charge which could
 
03:23:32.189 --> 03:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely raise funding for that sort
 
03:23:32.199 --> 03:23:34.510 align:start position:0%
absolutely raise funding for that sort
of

03:23:34.510 --> 03:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
thing so so actually the chair just
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
asked me to mention it in this context
 
03:23:41.830 --> 03:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
but I think we'll be talking some more
 
03:23:46.269 --> 03:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
about it um just if since you two are
 
03:23:51.150 --> 03:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
here here now um I had um presented to
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
the division with some input from Mr
 
03:23:59.950 --> 03:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
whim at this concept of the um waste uh
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
disposal surcharge and the concept that
 
03:24:09.870 --> 03:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
if we added some money um to into the
 
03:24:12.389 --> 03:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund to help
 
03:24:15.429 --> 03:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
defay employee costs I didn't know if
 
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
you wanted to add a little bit more
 
03:24:21.710 --> 03:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
about that so currently the entire Solid
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Waste uh group is on the general fund
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
and so establishing a search charge on
 
03:24:33.590 --> 03:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
waste disposed at our landfills would uh
 
03:24:36.030 --> 03:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
certainly uh allow us to offset that
 
03:24:40.189 --> 03:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
general fund uh expenditure and free up
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
General funds for other purposes and so
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
um I I believe representative eel you
 
03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned a
 
03:24:48.680 --> 03:24:51.030 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned a
$3.50

03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
$3.50
 
03:24:54.510 --> 03:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh SE charge that that that would allow
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
us to take the entire uh per ton and
 
03:24:59.870 --> 03:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
that would that's higher than most other
 
03:25:03.070 --> 03:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
places no no no it's not oh okay you
 
03:25:05.309 --> 03:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
missed my presentation I missed your
 
03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
presentation that would allow that's the
 
03:25:08.990 --> 03:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
way I remembered it but I could be wrong
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
us to take the entirety of the program
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
off of General funds and still have some
 
03:25:16.510 --> 03:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
funding left over for Grants and and and
 
03:25:18.670 --> 03:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
the like and whatever we need for for
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
communities to um provide them some some
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
funding to do some waste diversion
 
03:25:28.229 --> 03:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
activities it represent would your the
 
03:25:30.750 --> 03:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
language of your bill that would cover
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring closed landfills and you know
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
remediation or whatever so so the idea
 
03:25:41.070 --> 03:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
is that um of course it could be funded
 
03:25:44.429 --> 03:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
at any level with these discharge fees
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the concept would be that that um
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
you could take P this is what Mr whims
 
03:25:53.309 --> 03:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
said you could take 19 people off the
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
general fund at the
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
$350 level you could refund all the
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
money that the New Hampshire
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities have paid in back to them
 
03:26:07.150 --> 03:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
and you could also put about a million
 
03:26:10.750 --> 03:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
dollars into the grant program so you
 
03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
could to so to answer your question yes
 
03:26:17.070 --> 03:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
but we could fund the solid way
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh management Bureau fund our grants and
 
03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
still make our municipalities whole all
 
03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
Griffin you're all right so if I
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
remember the the numbers right there's
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
something like one one and 3/4 million
 
03:26:39.309 --> 03:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
tons is that it yeah yes the over the
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
last five years it's been closer to 2
 
03:26:43.710 --> 03:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
million on average but last year we saw
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
a slight decrease because a little bit
 
03:26:49.469 --> 03:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
less out ofate waste was brought in so
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
it was about 1.75 million ton last year
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
so are we not concerned that if we put a
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
fee on it the out of state waste will
 
03:26:58.990 --> 03:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
get even smaller because they'll they
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
have some alternative I I'm not sure
 
03:27:04.269 --> 03:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
that that that I would use the word
 
03:27:06.910 --> 03:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
concern it's possible that could happen
 
03:27:08.550 --> 03:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
that would make a lot of people very
 
03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
happy um a lot of members of the
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
legislature I believe would be very well
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
but I mean if we if we're counting on
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
this money to create job just pay for
 
03:27:20.110 --> 03:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
jobs then you know again the the the way
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
the numbers work if you look at that
 
03:27:27.229 --> 03:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
$33.50 proposed T ton tonage fee on um
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
at the last year's low at 1.75 million
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
ton that's about $6.1 million that would
 
03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely per per year so that would
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely cover the roughly $3 million
 
03:27:40.710 --> 03:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
operating budget for the entire program
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
so all positions all C everything State
 
03:27:45.229 --> 03:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
grant program associated with landfills
 
03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
all that um it would provide uh we think
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's hard a little bit hard to estimate
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
but we think the the the amount that
 
03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
would be needed as the language in the
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
bill provides um for uh providing
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
payments back to municipalities to sort
 
03:28:01.830 --> 03:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
of make them whole for what they've paid
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
for that search charge fee would be
 
03:28:05.790 --> 03:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
between one and two million so even if
 
03:28:07.710 --> 03:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
it's at the outside even if it's at 2
 
03:28:09.630 --> 03:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
million it would still leave a million
 
03:28:12.030 --> 03:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
dollars uh so you only got 3 million 2
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
million and then that to get to 6 you'd
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
have $1.1 million for making grants to
 
03:28:19.870 --> 03:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities businesses any others
 
03:28:22.229 --> 03:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
anybody who proposes to advance
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
technology and a facility that would
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
help um divert waste from disposal so as
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
we had some discussion last time the
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
hope would be that the fee would
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
actually drive certain policy goals and
 
03:28:36.910 --> 03:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
that in fact you might collect less over
 
03:28:39.630 --> 03:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
time um but that wouldn't necessarily
 
03:28:40.990 --> 03:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
are you currently have some kind of
 
03:28:43.229 --> 03:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
grant program like this or not yeah we
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
funded it we oh okay right it it it's
 
03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
been funded one with one general fund
 
03:28:50.590 --> 03:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation to date I understand
 
03:28:53.110 --> 03:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yeah is all that
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
Tage out of state no sir uh the LA like
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
last year for example um one about 1.1
 
03:29:03.429 --> 03:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
million ton was inate waste in generated
 
03:29:07.469 --> 03:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
waste and 670,000 ton were out of state
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
more typically it's on the order of
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
about a million and a million it's about
 
03:29:15.550 --> 03:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
5050 well is is any of that instate
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
waste coming from municipalities yes and
 
03:29:21.309 --> 03:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
and the way that the yes so this is
 
03:29:26.590 --> 03:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:30.189 --> 03:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
orties no no that's the I'm so that's
 
03:29:32.670 --> 03:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
the point when we constructed this
 
03:29:35.710 --> 03:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
before the money that the municipalities
 
03:29:38.750 --> 03:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
are paying will be refunded to
 
03:29:42.189 --> 03:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
them but and you retain the I mean we
 
03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
can talk about it more but you retain
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
the rest of it within the fund because
 
03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
we don't want to this is to help
 
03:29:52.110 --> 03:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and not to hurt them well
 
03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
but if municipalities are 1.1 oh but
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
some of them are are businesses they're
 
03:29:59.870 --> 03:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
not Municipal health I I can clarify if
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
it with theit's permission so of that
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
one if we say in round numbers if that 1
 
03:30:07.150 --> 03:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
million ton um that's in state generated
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
waste we and again we're estimating
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
because we never kind of parse this out
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
but we believe we have pretty good
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
information that suggest that no more
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
than 50% of that is waste that was paid
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
to be disposed of by Municipal by
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal governments and the language
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the proposal would uh
 
03:30:26.229 --> 03:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
basically allow them to itemize to us
 
03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
how much they spent in a given year and
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
we would refund all that back to them
 
03:30:32.349 --> 03:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
and that's that $2 million figure that
 
03:30:34.349 --> 03:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
when I broke down the6 million that's
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
what the $2 million was so 3 million to
 
03:30:38.790 --> 03:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
cover operating costs 2 million back to
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to kind essentially
 
03:30:42.429 --> 03:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
make them whole and then another million
 
03:30:45.309 --> 03:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
available for Grants I see all right
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.359 --> 03:31:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
right well
 
03:31:05.710 --> 03:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
um so I did I went to ncsl and I had
 
03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
them do a do a survey and the the search
 
03:31:13.630 --> 03:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
charges are all over the map um I think
 
03:31:15.510 --> 03:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
the thing is that there are an awful lot
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
of State states that you'll see on that
 
03:31:20.309 --> 03:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
list that have other sources of funds
 
03:31:23.229 --> 03:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
more than than we do so that's one thing
 
03:31:25.269 --> 03:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
but I think you also have to look at it
 
03:31:27.550 --> 03:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
from a regional standpoint so we talked
 
03:31:29.870 --> 03:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
about this um when I was talking about
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
the bill Maine has a state
 
03:31:37.469 --> 03:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
run um landfill and so if they're
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
charging money it's basically charging
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
money to help run their state fund their
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know Vermont has a $6 landfill I
 
03:31:48.389 --> 03:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
mean uh I'm sorry we've been up for
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
hours forever a $6 per ton search charge
 
03:31:54.910 --> 03:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they have had for a really really
 
03:31:58.630 --> 03:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
long time Massachusetts has a mechanism
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
where they uh use waste to energy uh
 
03:32:04.389 --> 03:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
credits of some sort to fund a
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar grant program we
 
03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that but but main I mean
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts only has like one landfill
 
03:32:15.469 --> 03:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
and a couple of waste of energy plants
 
03:32:15.479 --> 03:32:16.349 align:start position:0%
and a couple of waste of energy plants
and

03:32:16.349 --> 03:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
costs per for disposal are so much
 
03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
higher than ours I don't think they're
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
going to be running away too much if we
 
03:32:25.950 --> 03:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
add three bucks to a ton I mean the real
 
03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
costs here are Transportation costs and
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
not so much tipping fees um they're
 
03:32:33.510 --> 03:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
either railing it out or you know I
 
03:32:36.150 --> 03:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
think during my original presentation I
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
said the town of New London for instance
 
03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
to go from Bristol to Success New
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is almost $700 a hopper load
 
03:32:46.349 --> 03:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
so we
 
03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
really outliers in not having some sort
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
of um search charge to help defay the
 
03:32:57.229 --> 03:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
burden of solid waste in our state okay
 
03:33:00.429 --> 03:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
so um Melissa if we want to work on any
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the new bills we got we have to put
 
03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
it in the calendar or not yep I have
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
that as an item to discuss with you
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
after but if you want to I was um we I
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
think we got um seven new
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
bills assigned to division one so maybe
 
03:33:17.950 --> 03:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
put those for next Friday so I don't
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
know if you want to yes if you y cuz
 
03:33:22.830 --> 03:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's the soonest we could do I was
 
03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
thinking okay all right so my goal is to
 
03:33:28.389 --> 03:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
try to get through everything in house
 
03:33:31.710 --> 03:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
build too on Monday and Tuesday if
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
possible um and then we can we have
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we have our public hearing and
 
03:33:40.750 --> 03:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
then Friday maybe these bills and real
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
budget stuff right so
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah you think we can do that that yes
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
rep yes uh commissioner just just for
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
clarification first of all you all been
 
03:33:52.309 --> 03:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
very patient because we have so much
 
03:33:54.510 --> 03:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
here I appreciate that so what is your
 
03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
your your thought on what we want to
 
03:33:57.990 --> 03:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
make sure we're available to discuss the
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
homework assignment the fees yeah
 
03:34:04.830 --> 03:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah well that would be a new thing
 
03:34:06.269 --> 03:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
right so that's
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
probably either late Friday or or next
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
week right I don't know if there's much
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
time next week but yeah yeah might be
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
the following week yeah I think we're
 
03:34:18.510 --> 03:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to have I think we can get
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
through hb2 this week of the items that
 
03:34:22.590 --> 03:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
are in hb2 we're going to need a whole
 
03:34:24.269 --> 03:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
another separate discussion on what are
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
we adding to hbt so we're compiling some
 
03:34:29.070 --> 03:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
of those in the background this can be
 
03:34:30.429 --> 03:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
one of them we have fees from other
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
agencies as well so I figure we kind of
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
look at those as a packet all together
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
and then decide on that not next week
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
but the week after right all right we
 
03:34:41.910 --> 03:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
will see everybody on 10 o'clock on
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
Monday thank you
