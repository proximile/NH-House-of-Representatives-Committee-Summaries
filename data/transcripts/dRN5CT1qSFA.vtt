bills and I call on Senate Bill 45 and I
 
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 align:start position:0%

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
consideration this morning Senate Bill
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
45 relative to National Guard education
 
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
45 relative to National Guard education
benefits

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
um this bill is quite frankly fairly
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
simple and builds upon legislation that
 
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
was passed within last biennium which
 
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
would allow National Guard eligible
 
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
National Guard members to transfer their
 
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
educational benefits to their spouse
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is can be seen as a recruitment
 
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
tool for the National Guard and if the
 
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
member is not interested in attending
 
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.589 align:start position:0%
member is not interested in attending
college

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
that it will allow their spouse to
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
attend a four-year state or College
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
University with their benefits and
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Madam
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
chair if if I may ask as I read this the
 
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.210 align:start position:0%
chair if if I may ask as I read this the
spousal

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
spousal
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
benefit is already in statute and what
 
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
they added was the ability to use it at
 
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
the University system in addition to the
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
community college system correct that is
 
00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.210 align:start position:0%
community college system correct that is
correct

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.350 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
like having a brain cramp here
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
um you are absolutely correct it does
 
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 align:start position:0%
allow them to have access to
 
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
our University of New Hampshire and I
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
believe there's someone here from the
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
University system who will testify in
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
favor they did testify in favor in the
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
Senate as well
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I've got other are there
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
chair so this would allow both the
 
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
spouse and the serving member the
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of a four-year or just one or
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
um to be honest representative I'm not
 
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
um it's usually what happens is you
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
might have a National Guard member who
 
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
already has a college degree and doesn't
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
want to go for an advanced degree and I
 
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
don't believe they pay for an advanced
 
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.550 align:start position:0%
don't believe they pay for an advanced
degree

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
um but they're not going to use that
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
benefit so this is going to allow their
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
spouse to use the benefit I'm not sure
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
if both of them can and again there's uh
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Perry lines nine and ten lines
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
nine and ten would be my question yeah
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay let's see um members
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
yeah you can it can go back it looks
 
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
not at the same time thank you all right
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative thank
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
you I think you sort of answered this
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
but just to be completely clear the only
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
change this bill is doing is uh is
 
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
adding to the current benefit of being
 
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
able to use the community college system
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to use the university system
 
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
as well and everything else stays the
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
same everything else stays the same
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative all right thank you okay
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
the other question
 
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee for
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Warren Perry I'm
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
the deputy adjun general for New
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services
 
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the uh of this of
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 45 uh relative to National
 
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
Guard education benefits
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
as many of you may know the top
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
strategic challenge for the New
 
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard remains
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention for the next
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
generation of our service members in our
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
Armed Forces what this bill does very
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
simply is adds another tool in our
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
toolkit to help retain soldiers so after
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
they complete their first term Of
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
Enlistment they have the ability to
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
transfer their education benefits which
 
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
have been existing in statute for a long
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
time to their spouse and for clarity
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
it's one or the other at a time they can
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
transfer back and forth but only one can
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
use them at a time this is a tremendous
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
benefit for the members of the National
 
00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 align:start position:0%
Guard that they can continue to pursue
 
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 align:start position:0%
higher education uh
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
essentially for free so it's a it's a
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit so what we find is
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
when we recruit this Soldier we retain
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
the family so this is a an opportunity
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
for us to continue to retain soldiers
 
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.110 align:start position:0%
for us to continue to retain soldiers
uh

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions it's it's
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
really that simple we we appreciate the
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
partnership with both the community
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
college system of New Hampshire and the
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire but
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
you may have a very simple housekeeping
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
Booth thank you representative Schmidt
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chairman
 
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
um so why not both people at the same
 
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.430 align:start position:0%
um so why not both people at the same
time

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's uh I think it's just easier
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
to administer the program for us I mean
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that we couldn't do it
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
both at the same time the agreement that
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
we have with the community college
 
00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
system when we instituted this in the
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
last legislation legislative session was
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
that we would do one or the other
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
to to not overburden the system because
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
I mean nobody pays for this right it's
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh you know somebody goes to school for
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
free it's a it's a it's a sunk cost an
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost for the University
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
system I think it's just and it it
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't double the demand on the on the
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
University system I think another reason
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be not everybody needs to go to
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
school right so so there's no real need
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
for there to be both I think so follow
 
00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:49.730 align:start position:0%
for there to be both I think so follow
up

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
I I having taught at UNH a number of
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
years ago uh I know that you know the
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
university offers the benefit if I want
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
to take a course myself uh I can just
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
ask the instructor and as long as he or
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
she is not you know overburdened for
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
space or whatever uh they're happy to
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
oblige but the situation is uh you may
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
have somebody who is assigned uh I
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
understand this National Guard it's not
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
the same being transferred away from if
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're in the Air Force or the Marines
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
or whatever get transferred away you
 
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:31.220 align:start position:0%
lose the opportunity to go to
 
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
UNH hypothetically
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
um but but uh
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that would be a
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
benefit that that would if they can both
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
get away at the same time and they want
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
to go they have the advantage of
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
note-taking all the advantages of being
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the place with a with a companion a
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
fellow student
 
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
I think the department would be opposed
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
to that I just it's not the way we
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
envisioned the bill originally
 
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.509 align:start position:0%
envisioned the bill originally
representative

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
but you're not basically opposing it
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
either no I'm I'm not I'm not going to
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
come down either way I think that you
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
know and I'll let the the university
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
system kind of comment on any impacts
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
they have to the university system you
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
know to our to our way of thinking
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
transferring the benefit is it's this
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
it's similar to transferring one's GI
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
Bill benefits right so when when uh in
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
the post 911 GI Bill members of the
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
service could transfer their GI benefits
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
to a family member could it be a child
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
or a spouse or whoever they want to be
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
but you only had so many years of
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
Eligibility right so many months 36
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
months of eligibility for your GI bill
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
so if you transferred some of that away
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
it was gone you couldn't use it again
 
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I think we modeled this legislation
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
on that model would we be opposed to
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
saying you could do them both at the
 
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
same time I wouldn't be opposed to it I
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
have no idea it didn't really give it
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
much thought on what the implications
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
would be the university system thank you
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.829 align:start position:0%
very much
representative

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
may have implied the answer to this
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
earlier but uh you know everything costs
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
something so the question and I don't
 
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
see a fiscal note to pay for this so is
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh is it just the university system
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
either Community College or
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
UNH have to just absorb the cost is that
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
how it works my understanding is that
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
they absorb the cost in the in previous
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
versions of the legislation the the cost
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
was it was the the uh the benefit was
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
offered on a space available basis that
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
changed probably two or three
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions ago uh I do know
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
that the university system and the
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
community college system calculates the
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
cost the the the the opportunity cost of
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
this uh I don't have that in front of me
 
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
but I know that we they do calculate it
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't add a burden it just is
 
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
lost Revenue I guess what I what I would
 
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.410 align:start position:0%
lost Revenue I guess what I what I would
say

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we do have the university
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
system ready to explain that to us and
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
the other representative Simon thank you
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
this isn't specifically to the addition
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
but just trying to understand the law as
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
a general rule it says that the member
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
would be required a four-year reserve
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
duty service obligation from the date
 
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
that the benefit is transferred right
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
but then the spouse can transfer that
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
benefit back is there an additional four
 
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
years or is it just a one-time so so
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
when when the member is using the
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
benefit himself he just has to be a
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
member in good standing of the National
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
Guard so it doesn't incur another
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
service obligation just a member of good
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
in good standing so if they separate
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
from the military or they have some
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
pending uh some reason that they're not
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
not uh in favorably serving like in good
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
standing weight control is one of the
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
things you're not making military
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
standards then you would not be eligible
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
for the benefit so there would not be
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
another service obligation if it went
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
back to this to the service member and
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
again it's about retention right so the
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
guy guy or gal finishes their first term
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
Of Enlistment we want them to re-enlist
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
we tell them that their wife or their
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
husband can go to school for free if
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
they re-enlist then we get them for
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
another four years right that's that's
 
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
right that's that's the the very pointed
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
way of saying right yeah thank you
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
encourage continued service
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
I don't see any more questions so thank
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you and I think that
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
leads into the university
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee for the record my
 
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
name is Catherine provencher I service
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
the chief administrative officer for our
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
state's University system of the
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
University system is in favor of
 
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
supporting Senate Bill 45 we testified
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
to that as Senator Carson mentioned in
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate I provided some written
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
testimony for you and for the record I
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
passed that out earlier it was part of
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
our public Mission we've been supporting
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
National Guards men and women since 1996
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
over the last decade we've provided
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
educational benefits to over 7 000
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
National Guardsmen and women we do
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
calculate the cost if you will and and
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
the university system and the community
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
college system absorb that because it's
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
part of our public Mission last Academic
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
Year that was about 2.6 million dollars
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
in tuition waivers averaging about
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
seventy three hundred dollars per
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
um guard's been a woman that took
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of the benefit
 
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.949 align:start position:0%
advantage of the benefit
um

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
to answer questions on the fiscal note
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
honestly we aren't sure how
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
um how many spouses may take advantage
 
00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:51.500 align:start position:0%
of this benefit
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the cost if we provided
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
the benefit to both at the same time so
 
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
again this is I believe
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
and um the deputy in general would know
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
better than I I think this passed in the
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
last legislative session
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
for the community college system and
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
because of the timing of the University
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
system wasn't asked to to be included in
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
the bill and so we were happy to support
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
it this this session in Senate bill 45.
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and and thank you for the
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
numbers we always appreciate those uh
 
00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:33.139 align:start position:0%
is as I read this this would apply to
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
any degree granting curriculum including
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
graduate work
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
is that true I believe so yes okay thank
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative shrew
 
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question ma'am
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
um so if uh if a spouse would have to
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this and go to a
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
school at unh
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
full time what is is that cost 7 300
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
what was that cost
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um in-state tuition at the University of
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I believe is about fifteen
 
00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:06.110 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I believe is about fifteen
thousand

um Senate Bill 96. uh this bill was
 
00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:48.299 align:start position:0%
brought uh as as a request of a
 
00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:49.610 align:start position:0%
brought uh as as a request of a
constituent

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the short version of the bill is
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
about fairness right so the whole
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to make sure that
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
public entities that submit rfps don't
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
put language into an RFP that steers
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um a contract to a specific company
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
because they have specific problems who
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.529 align:start position:0%
is this
policy

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
only extended to the state energy
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
performance Contracting why not other
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure so again it was about an identified
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
identified issue is why this was brought
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
up is that in some of the state
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
performance contracts there were some
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
energy performance contracts there were
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
some proprietary information written
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
into the contract that was steering the
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
the contracts in a given Direction and
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
all right well I guess that's the
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
obvious question to
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question follow-up yes
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
so if this was targeted to a specific
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
issue to do with energy performance
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
Contracting how do we know that this
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
issue is not being
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
how do we address this issue if it's
 
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
how do we address this issue if it's
being

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.370 align:start position:0%
being
um

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
used for other types of Contracting do
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer for that again I
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
take one problem at one time and this is
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
the problem that was put in front of me
 
00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
and I looked to correct
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
and in the state we use the distinct
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
that distinction to say if it's a bid
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking strictly at price and if
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's a proposal we're looking at more
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
than price so bid would be used for
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
things that are
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
um you know we're buying a box of
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
pencils and they're all the same pencils
 
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
we're just looking for the cheapest ones
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
where um an RFP would be a proposal for
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
more of a service type so you're looking
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
for different qualities in the company
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and I have a question these uh Energy
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
Efficiency contracts are for state-owned
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
buildings for the most part or
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
state-owned facilities so the ones that
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
go through my office the division of
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
plant property are all for state-owned
 
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.070 align:start position:0%
plant property are all for state-owned
buildings

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
um municipalities as well as school
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
districts are also allowed to use this
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
process however as you mentioned earlier
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're not required to follow the state
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
um rules and laws that guide it yeah
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
no no okay representative Goulds okay
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
got in ahead all right perhaps I'm Gould
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
as I said before having participated in
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
the process and
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
um knowing the Integrity this build just
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
follows suit and I support it gold
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
click and call the roll
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
representative Simon yes representative
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%

representative Gould yes and the chair
 
00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:25.730 align:start position:0%
representative Gould yes and the chair
yes

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
16 years
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
all right the motion passes 16-0 and the
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
objections to consent
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay I will let go representative
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
lekkus's comment that I'm surprised that
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
this is necessary and uh I would hope
 
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
that the general procurement statutes
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
are more specific about how about the
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
fairness required
 
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.770 align:start position:0%
fairness required
okay

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:53.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
do you want a report on this yes please
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
and I promise you I'll follow through
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
this I promise you I'll follow through
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
this time thank you very much please uh
 
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.670 align:start position:0%
this time thank you very much please uh
report

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
at your earliest convenience and we have
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
15 minutes this time
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I will go through those changes
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
first this would be applicable to large
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
fabricated items instead of small items
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
such as nuts bolts and hinges
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
secondly this would only be applicable
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
to State projects not maintenance
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
projects that are 100 million excuse me
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
one million dollars or more
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
third state-funded contracts would have
 
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
to identify steel products in the
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
project documents so that all bidders
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
are aware of the requirements and
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
finally a procedure would be set up with
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire administrative
 
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
services to allow for waivers when there
 
00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:10.099 align:start position:0%
are Supply chains or availability issues
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I will I will end my
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
testimony at this point there are
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
members from the steel industry that are
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
here that would be able to answer your
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
questions much better than I can so I
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time this morning and
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you senator
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
not taking questions that's fine it
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
looks like you've got a full staff
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
behind you
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
McGuire I represent the town of Epsom
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm in favor of this bill
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
um mostly because for very different
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
reasons I think from others in that this
 
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
is really horrible policy and so
 
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:05.540 align:start position:0%
anything that reduces really horrible
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
policy seems to me to be a good thing I
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
hand it out to you a short article a
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
couple pages from Professor Boudreau
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
that talks about why this is bad policy
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
um but but in a nutshell
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
protectionism is not a good idea when
 
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
when we try
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's a concept in economics of the
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
scene and the Unseen when you have some
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
kind of policy like this it's easy to
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
see who benefits right the people who
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
benefit are the people in the steel
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
industry right but the people who are
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
hurt are sort of invisible because the
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
people who are hurt are the people who's
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
who would have a job or would have
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
higher income otherwise right that if
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
the if this policy wasn't in place and
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
they're they're sort of two kinds of of
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
people like that one is in the in the
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
steel industry itself let's suppose that
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
a steel job moved overseas right so so
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
um because somebody overseas could make
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
steel cheaper than than we can
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so the money we send overseas has to
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
come back to the U.S and be paid to
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
somebody who can do something better
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
than somebody overseas can do that other
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
thing somebody in the lumber industry or
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
somebody in the computer industry or
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
somebody in the movie industry or
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
whatever right those are the Unseen
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
people and if if our funds don't go to
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
the steel producer overseas then that
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
overseas person can't can't get the
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
funds back to us in the sense right so
 
00:49:57.599 --> 00:49:58.910 align:start position:0%
funds back to us in the sense right so
so

00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the one loss is the
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
people that would normally have sold to
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
the overseas people and don't right but
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
they're invisible the same thing is the
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
domestic consumers so let's say we
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
because of this policy spend two dollars
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
for steel when otherwise if we bought it
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
overseas we'd spend a dollar
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
well we have a dollar less right we're
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
buying steel for two dollars and if we
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
could have bought it for a dollar we'd
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
have a dollar more and some of that
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
dollar more would go to domestic
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
producers of something else right so
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
those are unseen people if you see what
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
I mean so so
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
protectionist policy like this is is
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
simply a bad idea but it it feels good
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
because it's obvious who's being helped
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
right we can see the steel you know the
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
poor steel person is losing their job
 
00:50:57.849 --> 00:50:57.859 align:start position:0%
but what we don't see is all the people
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
who are losing their jobs as a
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
consequence of this policy
 
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and committee
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name's Gary
 
00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:44.900 align:start position:0%
Abbott I'm the Executive Vice President
 
00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:47.540 align:start position:0%
of the associated
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me associated general contractors
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:51:55.089 --> 00:51:55.099 align:start position:0%
I represent both building and Highway
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
commercial contractors and
 
00:52:01.569 --> 00:52:01.579 align:start position:0%
subcontractors and even some suppliers
 
00:52:05.049 --> 00:52:05.059 align:start position:0%
I appreciate
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
the sponsor putting this bill in she did
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
Cover the pretty much the four items
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
that I have here that we've highlighted
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
understand that I represent the
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
commercial construction industry who
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
deals with this currently
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
both on Airport projects they deal with
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
it with Federal projects Highway
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
projects there has been a buy America
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
steel provision for many years on those
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
projects that have Federal requirements
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
and so last year the legislature adopted
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
the policy of buy America Steel
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
the language was vague I know our
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
industry me representing contractors had
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
difficulty explaining what this applies
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
to and what it does not apply to
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
I think the consensus through that
 
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.059 align:start position:0%
process was we were talking about
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
fabricated steel uh the larger items the
 
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
larger pieces on construction projects
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
not the small items that you get at Home
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
Depot that kind of thing be very hard to
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
track or even purchase buy American
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
Steel products for hinges that kind of
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
thing you got to think of a building
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
project and all the suppliers and
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
companies that work on it so what this
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill does and there's some key points
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
the clarification when you read those
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
items they are somewhat Technical and
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
construction related cheers does not
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
mean like chairs we're sitting in
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
they're chairs for the rebar that goes
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
into sidewalks it's a little it's a
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
different it's a different chairs I know
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
some have read this bill that language I
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
have to tell you I got from Federal
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
Highway it was one of their
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
clarifications of what the Buy America
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
steal so we want to duplicate what is
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
happening with the federal projects in
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
the state projects so we're playing on
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
the same Level Playing Field is what
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
we're talking about by America so that
 
00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:05.579 align:start position:0%
was part of the definitions really used
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
a Federal Highway memo that did a
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
clarification we agreed it was for
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
larger projects the 1 million and over
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
make sense and it kind of ties in within
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
the third bullet point that I have is
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
you need it in the project you want
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
every bidder knowing what items we're
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
talking about this is one of the things
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
the contractors brought to me that they
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
know what a Bridge Project what items
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're talking about if you do an airport
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
project they tell you what items
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so we want the same
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing here in the state if you have a
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
state on a state project it should be in
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
the project documents now this helps
 
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
both sides whether you're a steel
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
fabricator or a contractor bidding the
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
job you know what items you've got to
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
make sure are by America so everybody's
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
on the same Level Playing Field you
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody coming in who says I
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the law
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't follow the law this
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
would make it uh not competitive for a
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
contractor in New Hampshire who knew the
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
law so it needs to be in the contract
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
documents and that's what this does the
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
fourth bullet that was not in the
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
language that was passed it left it up
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the court system to here disputes if
 
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
anybody objected any person said I don't
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
think you met the by America even with
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
the definitions being as vague as it is
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
you had to go to court to resolve it
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
we think the power should be with
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
administrative services on state
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
projects whether it's a wave or whether
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with a project that way
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
both the contractor or supplier could
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
highlight this before the Project's bid
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's our hope is that all this is
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
resolved ahead of time especially if we
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
have supply chain issues as we currently
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
do if there is a problem getting some
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
item identified administrative Services
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
would be the oversight makes sense this
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
applies to just State projects
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
so with that I would hope the committee
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
would support and I really look at this
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
as clarification
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
of the bill that you passed last year
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
that set the policy without the details
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
and the reason the details weren't
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
completely worked out
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
the bill changed shape in the last week
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
during the committee conference it had
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
some of these items in it those were
 
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
removed so we're here today to try to
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
get that back so with that I would
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and hope the
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
committee supports this bill
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I remember having the Das
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh allowing waivers in the version of
 
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
the bill that we passed it was there but
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
it went away in the last version that
 
00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
went and got tacked on to the crypto
 
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.730 align:start position:0%
went and got tacked on to the crypto
bill

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.170 align:start position:0%
bill
ah

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I wasn't aware of
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
where it and went to stray are there any
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
before this thank you madam chair before
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
this one million dollar change what was
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
it before this
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
really wasn't clarified in the bill and
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
that's where the confusion of what items
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Steel components in I
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
think it started with a million I
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
believe oh it did originally
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at the statute today
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not there ah yes when this
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee passed it last year it did
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
have a threshold of I believe a million
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
dollars was the amount yeah there were
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
components your committee saw that was
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
still there and uh we were happy with
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
what the senate had passed so we didn't
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
play a very big role last year as you
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
were deciding the policy question we
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
were neutral on the policy question but
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
just it just is how the process worked
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
that some of these things got removed
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up question
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
is that before the nuts and bolts and
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
everything in
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
throughout lines 6 through 10 were not
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
included this is added in this version
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
I will I will repeat with the chairman
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
it was in the Senate version that came
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
across the Senate amended it with that
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts version and some of these
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
other parts you looked at it you played
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
with a part that was not that's no
 
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
longer in here there was a 25 and I know
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
this committee had a whole thing there
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
was some threshold of an amount but I
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
think when you give it to administrative
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
Services it solves that so that's not
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
there there was a piece that your
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee did amend
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
but I think what we're saying is all of
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
this was in the original bills it just
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
the last week it got changed out to a
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
different version ah I will remind the
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee that you have received a
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
research report on this topic that uh
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
it appears not all of us have read as
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
thoroughly as it deserves
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
I certainly didn't so I'm surprised to
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent true and then representative
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I'm just
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get a handle on what
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
structural steel is in this bill
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
so is that's
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
the bid is out to uh to put in a new
 
00:59:33.299 --> 00:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
the bid is out to uh to put in a new
bridge

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
and to pave uh 100 yards on each side of
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the bridge so it's the huge i-beams
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
going in to be the fabricate yeah the
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
fabricated steel portion and in this
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill you'll see it's the latest edition
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
of the American Institute of Steel and
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
it's the fabrication portion that is
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
that would be covered under this that
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair and
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
the million dollar threshold
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
is not a million dollars of structural
 
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.930 align:start position:0%
is not a million dollars of structural
steel

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
steel
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's a million dollars of the whole bid
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
and there may be a hundred thousand
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of structural steel that's
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
correct any project that's over a
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
million is is what's classified here not
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
a million dollars of fabricated steel
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
thank you it's really to eliminate when
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
the state goes out and hires a
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
subcontractor to fix the plumbing in the
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office it's not intended for
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.609 align:start position:0%
 
replenishment

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I remember
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
having the bill and and it's got you
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
know a million different little
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications and so forth
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
so but the bottom line is we're not
 
01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
talking about people making steel right
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people making things
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
out of steel and where you get the steel
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
is has nothing to do with uh whether
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's American or not is that correct
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
well it's a process
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
um it is from the molten stage in the
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
United States to the fabricator made as
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
the state it's the steel it is both you
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
have to show that it was the molten
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
steel was made in the United States and
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
then went to the fabricator to make the
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
product make the size beam say let's
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
just say a bridge beam of whatever size
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
bridge I need they would make it and so
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
there would be a it would be a buy
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
America from that point it's just not I
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
went to the local Home Depot and that
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
qualifies that does not qualify as a buy
 
01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.789 align:start position:0%
qualifies that does not qualify as a buy
America

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
America
 
01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I really
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate your summary of what this
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does thank you
 
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.549 align:start position:0%
this bill does thank you
and

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
um Amy Charbonneau from Continental
 
01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:18.829 align:start position:0%
um Amy Charbonneau from Continental
Paving

01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
Paving
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
um Gary did a great job summarizing I
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just wanted to come up as an
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
end user of the what is written for the
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
state as a contract so the RSA would
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
fall down on us as a contractor
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
um we support family business in New
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we had nothing against the
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
bill from the beginning all we needed
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
was the clarification
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
um so the important part of the bid
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
process is what would play really
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
important to us and to answer your
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
question so what it would do is give the
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the steel manufacturers
 
01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
to keep the state honest and for us
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
people to be able to bid honestly so
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
when a bid comes out they have a list of
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
items and currently right now the items
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
are listed and you actually know
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
particularly like down to the
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty each item that has that's
 
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
in the job and it would list which ones
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
have to be made in the United States and
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
at that point it would give the steel
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
people the ability to
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
um ask questions to the the state and
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
the bidding process if they missed an
 
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:18.740 align:start position:0%
item but it also gives the unit like
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
uniformity in a bid there can be a lot
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
of confusion when especially
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-staters come in and New Hampshire
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
people know the rule and you can lose a
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire company could lose a bid
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
on based on doing it by the way it's
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
written now and not having Clarity and
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
it leaves the dot in my eyes a lot of
 
01:03:40.089 --> 01:03:40.099 align:start position:0%
uncertainty after the fact to try and
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
imply these rules onto somebody who
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
didn't know them so I think it causes a
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion in the bidding process
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
could cost a lot of money to the dot and
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
then second
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
when it plays through if this was were
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
not to pass out on the job it can cause
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of delays and a lot of confusion
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
again because what items can you go in
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
the middle of building a bridge you
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
can't like the certs and the paperwork
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
and all that takes so many people in
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
your office and without the clarity we
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
are unable to really do what we're
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing so we're just
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
asking for the clarification and the
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
support to be able to do our job every
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
day for the state most efficiently and
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
low cost that we possibly can so that's
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
all I had to say if anybody has any
 
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
all I had to say if anybody has any
questions

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think you covered everything admirably
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and committee
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
members I'm Holly novletski I'm
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
structural steel fabricator located in
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
Greenland New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
um accompanied by some of my other
 
01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:56.660 align:start position:0%
fabricator uh members from New Hampshire
 
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
we do support this bill that AGC brought
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
forward I think it provides needed

um last year the house passed this
policy

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:49.940 align:start position:0%
and I view this bill as a clarification
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
and an assistance in in the bidding
 
01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
and an assistance in in the bidding
process

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
and that's basically
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
why I moved to Auto pass all right
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think it
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
all right seeing non-themotion is ought
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.049 --> 01:06:23.059 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me please forgive me
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative true and which bill
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
um was it that
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
the house passed last year was it 438 or
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
I have I I know the answer if you don't
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
mind so we passed Health bill Senate it
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
was Senate Bill 438 that came over to
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
all right and then we passed that
 
01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:48.059 align:start position:0%
and we had amended it to include some of
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
the million dollar components and then
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
when it went back to the Senate
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
um there was a committee of conference
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
and these the bill was attached to House
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 1552 I believe which was a
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency bill
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
the some of the components of the
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
original Senate bill that came to us had
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
not been added and the part that is
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
specifically missing is the part that's
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
in this Senate bill now online
 
01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.870 align:start position:0%
in this Senate bill now online
um yeah

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
yeah line ten you the part that's bolded
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that should have been in the the amended
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
version on House Bill 1552 during the
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee of conference but it was not
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
added and that's how that's why we are
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
here today we're just basically fixing
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
something that should have been correct
 
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
both the Senate bills sorry 1503 I got
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
the wrong bill yeah sorry both the
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
Senate bill and the house bill
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
were amended with a totally different
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
place and the the Senate bill that we
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
fixed had a major
 
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:04.940 align:start position:0%
at a non-germain Amendment added that
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
caused it to the Senate to non-concur so
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
that that language died and that they
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
added it back into a house bill
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
irrelevant a different house bill with
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
no relation to it but they added their
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else confused representative shua
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
if you haven't had time to read the
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
research paper it it got very convoluted
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
last year but this explains it very well
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I think you'd have a deeper
 
01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.390 align:start position:0%
and I think you'd have a deeper
understanding

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes it definitely got convoluted
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.749 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
this time the emotion is ought to pass
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
by representative and the clerk can call
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Simon yes representative
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
Lucas yes representative Bailey yes
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative true yes representative
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
Dolan yes representative a bear yes
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard yes clerk vote
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
Yes representative groda yes
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt yes
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative goalie yes representative
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
shrewitt yes representative Davis yes
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick yes
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gould yes and the chair
 
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.890 align:start position:0%
representative Gould yes and the chair
yes

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
16 a zero name
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right the motion passes 16 to zero
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
is there any objection to consent
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll put this one
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
on consent
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
what the the fiscal impact is
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
indeterminable but probably small
 
01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:51.349 align:start position:0%
indeterminable but probably small
um

01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
I think I don't think that's enough to
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's uh that's all we have for
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your hard work and
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency and the we will resume at 1pm
 
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:43:10.849 --> 02:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
um and and FEMA homeland security has
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
one too so you can pick either one and
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
put them with the kits in fact you can
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
build these any way you want or you can
 
02:43:18.650 --> 02:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
buy a pre-made kit
 
02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh list so I want to read something and
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to share a copy of this letter
 
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
with all of you and then I will finish
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
up my testimony this is from David Hurst
 
02:43:28.010 --> 02:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
she's a resident of Bedford New
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he's an emergency medical
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
physician that actually works in the
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
North country and Dr Hersh and I used to
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
work together at Concord Hospital for a
 
02:43:37.849 --> 02:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
he was not able to be here today but he
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you and this is key
 
02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
almost 10 years ago I had the
 
02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunate opportunity to experience
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
firsthand how immediate Hemorrhage
 
02:43:50.090 --> 02:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
control can save lives I was stationed
 
02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
at the finish line of the medical tent
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
for the Boston Marathon bombing and was
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
one of the first Rescuers to arrive at
 
02:43:58.490 --> 02:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
the bombing site within minutes of the
 
02:43:58.500 --> 02:43:59.450 align:start position:0%
the bombing site within minutes of the
blast

02:43:59.450 --> 02:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
blast
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
although this was a terrible tragedy
 
02:44:04.849 --> 02:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
with 280 victims and three immediate
 
02:44:07.490 --> 02:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
fatalities I learned how immediate
 
02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
bleeding control could help save lives
 
02:44:12.050 --> 02:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
of everyone that was transported to the
 
02:44:12.060 --> 02:44:12.889 align:start position:0%
of everyone that was transported to the
hospital

02:44:12.889 --> 02:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
there was a there was also a large
 
02:44:17.690 --> 02:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
contribution from bystanders many
 
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
without prior medical training some with
 
02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
but they had to rely on improvised
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
devices t-shirts and belts they didn't
 
02:44:27.170 --> 02:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
have these they didn't have kits that
 
02:44:29.330 --> 02:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
were already pre-prepared not all
 
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
incidents that were that cause
 
02:44:33.410 --> 02:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled Hemorrhage are incidents
 
02:44:35.809 --> 02:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
that involve you know penetrating trauma
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
or a bombing or a shooting or a stabbing
 
02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
it can be quite simply but very scary
 
02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
broken glass if in the wrong place you
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
know it's ever an artery and again
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
someone could bleed to death in under
 
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
02:44:51.170 --> 02:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
so I've included in this bill limited
 
02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
liability it's the same Protection One
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
Would experience under the Good
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
Samaritan law if they have to act I've
 
02:44:59.330 --> 02:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
also included it here making a
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
connection it's not required but they
 
02:45:02.809 --> 02:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
could connect with the local emergency
 
02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
department Physicians who work with EMS
 
02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
and might have a preference you know
 
02:45:08.809 --> 02:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
might be able to guide them on this is
 
02:45:10.429 --> 02:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
what you should here's some equipment
 
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
and here's what you you can buy it's
 
02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:15.230 align:start position:0%
and here's what you you can buy it's
um

02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
these kits if you put them together it
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
can span anywhere from 23 to 83 dollars
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's why you see a variation in the
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
this bill also puts a dedicated Fund in
 
02:45:29.929 --> 02:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
place so that
 
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
as we move forward if folks want to
 
02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
contribute you know if there was a group
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
that wanted to make a contribution so
 
02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we could put these in more of the
 
02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
public you know more state buildings and
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
grow this program there would be a place
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
for this money to actually go we did
 
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
this with the AED commission that I'm
 
02:45:48.770 --> 02:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
now going to date myself that I was a
 
02:45:50.090 --> 02:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
part of when I worked at the Bureau of
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
EMS oh gosh in in the um the late 2000s
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
so we've done us we have done this kind
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
of work before I also
 
02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
um set up and this is where the bill had
 
02:46:03.050 --> 02:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
gotten amended in the committee in the
 
02:46:05.389 --> 02:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna set up a committee that has
 
02:46:07.969 --> 02:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
one person from EMS one first doctor
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
from the medical control board that's
 
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
authorized in statute and a member of
 
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
administrative services that can take
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
this list and
 
02:46:19.849 --> 02:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
set up set the criteria for basically
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
triage like what buildings would go
 
02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
first because that's you know what's
 
02:46:24.830 --> 02:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to be hard to sort out so let's
 
02:46:26.929 --> 02:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
let the experts that would be enabled in
 
02:46:30.770 --> 02:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
the statute to do this and that's um
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
yeah the three-person committee and I
 
02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
think that that's it for now I'll share
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
Dr Hirsch's letter I do appreciate the
 
02:46:39.349 --> 02:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm happy to answer any
 
02:46:41.389 --> 02:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
questions you have if I can I do have
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
with me some members of the Emergency
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
Medical Services community and one of my
 
02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors here that are available as
 
02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
well and I'm sorry I have to keep
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
tipping over this way but I've got this
 
02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:52.250 align:start position:0%
tipping over this way but I've got this
speaker

02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
it's good thank you chairman okay thank
 
02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
you Senator are there questions from the
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gould
 
02:47:00.889 --> 02:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Adam Sharon thank you Senator
 
02:47:02.809 --> 02:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
Apprentice for taking my question I
 
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
believe I saw recently a video about
 
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
these kits do you know if that's um on
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
the the State Fire standards website or
 
02:47:16.130 --> 02:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
if that's on YouTube I think I don't I
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
we are our chief of EMS that's here okay
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
all right could be if you Google so the
 
02:47:23.929 --> 02:47:23.939 align:start position:0%
American College of Surgeons has
 
02:47:25.849 --> 02:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
something called stop the bleed and
 
02:47:27.230 --> 02:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's where this is the public
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
initiative this is the New Hampshire
 
02:47:31.730 --> 02:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
version of that some states have done
 
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
this differently and we are one of them
 
02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
so if you Google stop the bleed you can
 
02:47:37.610 --> 02:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
actually see this yes thank you for your
 
02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:39.590 align:start position:0%
actually see this yes thank you for your
questions

02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good afternoon
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
Senator uh you started your speech
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
saying that you were aiming at select
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
but not all buildings
 
02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
um could you Enlighten us as to which
 
02:47:55.630 --> 02:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
buildings would not be included in this
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
so what thank you for the question
 
02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative schuett um
 
02:48:02.330 --> 02:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
there are over 5 000 buildings between
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
ones that are owned by the state and one
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
and space that is leased by the state
 
02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
so in an effort
 
02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
to get these rolled out but I worked
 
02:48:16.250 --> 02:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
with administrative services to identify
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
to really 221 of the most high traffic
 
02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
you know public and as well as employee
 
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
buildings that would be best suited
 
02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
bless you and that's where we would
 
02:48:29.270 --> 02:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
start so this committee would make the
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
decision using the funding that they had
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
to and these 221 buildings what the
 
02:48:37.370 --> 02:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
criteria is and where they would start
 
02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
placing them and it is my hope and
 
02:48:41.889 --> 02:48:41.899 align:start position:0%
that's why I set up the fund that we can
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
we can even receive private dot you know
 
02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
we can receive grants and other ways to
 
02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
build this out you know there are
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
seasonal locations that have campgrounds
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
that would actually probably be great
 
02:48:55.490 --> 02:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
places for this but there isn't somebody
 
02:48:57.889 --> 02:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
there throughout the year so we're going
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
to have to approach this in a tiered
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.570 --> 02:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative blackis thank you
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
um I noticed you have something here
 
02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
about replacement and I know these
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
things don't last forever
 
02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
um so do you have some estimate as to
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
what the ongoing costs will be of
 
02:49:18.410 --> 02:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
handling uh regular replacement of these
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
02:49:23.570 --> 02:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere between 23 and 83 dollars
 
02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
depending on that's our estimate
 
02:49:27.889 --> 02:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
depending on what if you buy a pre-made
 
02:49:29.929 --> 02:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
kit or you put it together yourself it's
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
not an annual they don't none of this
 
02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:33.250 align:start position:0%
not an annual they don't none of this
equipment

02:49:33.250 --> 02:49:33.260 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
none of this equipment expires so but
 
02:49:40.849 --> 02:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
you would still you know over time if um
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know like rubber gloves can become
 
02:49:44.929 --> 02:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
kind of they can become fragile if
 
02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're not replaced so you know
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
the building we'd have to work with the
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
buildings to make sure that they um you
 
02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
know that they check these just like
 
02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
they do their aeds that everything is
 
02:49:56.450 --> 02:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
there that's supposed to be so there
 
02:49:58.010 --> 02:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
isn't a specific replacement cost I
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
would estimate as being just what the
 
02:50:01.450 --> 02:50:01.460 align:start position:0%
initial purchase price
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
so do you have a general feel for how
 
02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
long they'd have to go without
 
02:50:06.650 --> 02:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
replacement I mean I actually
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with this I have them in
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
our vehicles
 
02:50:11.809 --> 02:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
um and I know they last quite a while
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
but not forever yeah so just trying to
 
02:50:17.870 --> 02:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
get a feel if I thank you um for the
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
question representative Lucas I don't
 
02:50:21.530 --> 02:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
have an exact place I can point my
 
02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
finger one of my um colleagues that's
 
02:50:26.030 --> 02:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
here with me may be able to oh all right
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
other questions representative carehart
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'm so just to explain where I'm coming
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
from I saw a video over the weekend of
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who's stabbed to death out in
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
Vancouver out from a Starbucks just
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
completely random but what I'm concerned
 
02:50:45.230 --> 02:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
about is we have the materials but we
 
02:50:47.270 --> 02:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the training and is there
 
02:50:49.010 --> 02:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
anything in place to kind of train
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
people I don't know maybe something in a
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
school or is there any kind of long-term
 
02:50:53.690 --> 02:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
plan for something like that because
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's all good to have the stuff there
 
02:50:56.809 --> 02:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
but if nobody knows how to use it I
 
02:50:59.570 --> 02:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
understand as a such as a a poster
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's enclosed in each kit but I mean
 
02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
somebody's bleeding out and you're
 
02:51:04.250 --> 02:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
reading instructions that could be kind
 
02:51:04.260 --> 02:51:05.090 align:start position:0%
reading instructions that could be kind
of

02:51:05.090 --> 02:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:51:06.349 --> 02:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there's any plans
 
02:51:07.969 --> 02:51:07.979 align:start position:0%
though or that was kind of beyond the
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
scope and thank you for your question
 
02:51:13.370 --> 02:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
so in approaching this uh you know again
 
02:51:15.889 --> 02:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
looking back on the the defibrillators
 
02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
in the early days
 
02:51:19.370 --> 02:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
we thought we as EMTs were the only ones
 
02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
that could do this and then we found the
 
02:51:22.610 --> 02:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
technology to make it easy and the
 
02:51:25.130 --> 02:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
public intuitively is able to pick these
 
02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
machines up and use them so this is
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
framed in the same way and I know like
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
looking at a card
 
02:51:32.929 --> 02:51:32.939 align:start position:0%
um you know it could it could take a
 
02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
couple seconds to get yourself through
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
that but how intuitively the public has
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
been able to already do this so we're
 
02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
building upon that and you know it would
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
be ideal that we could
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
how you know I don't want to mandate
 
02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
training I want to put this out there in
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
the same way that we've done other
 
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
things and then have people rise to the
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
occasion and say you know well we're you
 
02:51:56.990 --> 02:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
know say it in the state house you have
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
now and that you have these trauma kits
 
02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
and this is what's in them and this is
 
02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
how to use them and make it just just
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
put them near the aeds and you would get
 
02:52:07.309 --> 02:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
that basic information so my fear is if
 
02:52:08.809 --> 02:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
that we mandate it it'll hold up getting
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
these out there and that we we do this
 
02:52:13.010 --> 02:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
and then rise to the occasion thank you
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
02:52:16.389 --> 02:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
other questions representative build
 
02:52:18.769 --> 02:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cronus I just remembered
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
um at the New Hampshire Historical
 
02:52:26.030 --> 02:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
Society Library they have a kit and
 
02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
there was a poster with it so I wanted
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
to reassure representative Gerhard it
 
02:52:31.610 --> 02:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
was so informative looking over that
 
02:52:33.469 --> 02:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
little piece of paper in the coat room
 
02:52:35.330 --> 02:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Historical Society
 
02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
I thought I had watched an entire
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
educational video about it thank you
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:44.769 align:start position:0%
I have a question
um

02:52:44.769 --> 02:52:44.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
why I understand drama kids are good to
 
02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
have where there's a lot of people
 
02:52:52.969 --> 02:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
run coming in and out but
 
02:52:55.969 --> 02:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
why why is this necessarily to be
 
02:52:55.979 --> 02:52:58.070 align:start position:0%
why why is this necessarily to be
mandated

02:52:58.070 --> 02:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
well putting them in the building if we
 
02:53:02.570 --> 02:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
if we want to lead and we know this is
 
02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
the third leading cause of death and we
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
want to lean into and give people just
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
like we have aeds in these buildings
 
02:53:13.849 --> 02:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
why you know this is the opportunity so
 
02:53:15.650 --> 02:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
to get something started this is where
 
02:53:17.630 --> 02:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:53:21.410 --> 02:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
I see thank you other questions
 
02:53:23.210 --> 02:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and do you have a clerk I can
 
02:53:28.130 --> 02:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
give the letter to
 
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
let's we'll pass it around but I think
 
02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:33.769 align:start position:0%
let's we'll pass it around but I think
you

02:53:33.769 --> 02:53:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have any other cards is
 
02:53:38.450 --> 02:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560 align:start position:0%

02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:06.530 align:start position:0%
committee
um

02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
didn't really plan on
 
02:54:10.849 --> 02:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
um speaking but I am a co-sponsor of the
 
02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm also a stop to bleed
 
02:54:15.410 --> 02:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
instructor and and that you can usually
 
02:54:17.809 --> 02:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
get that instruction fairly uh
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
inexpensive or sometimes free
 
02:54:23.809 --> 02:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that I am also an
 
02:54:28.849 --> 02:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
EMT I teach uh tactical EMS as well and
 
02:54:28.859 --> 02:54:29.570 align:start position:0%
EMT I teach uh tactical EMS as well and
um

02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
02:54:34.190 --> 02:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
either in video or in real life these
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
bleeds and if there is an equipment
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
people can die in less than five minutes
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
in some cases but usually the average is
 
02:54:46.130 --> 02:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
five so having these available is uh
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
almost as important as the AED
 
02:54:51.469 --> 02:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
so I think by pushing them out into
 
02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
state buildings where people can see
 
02:54:53.460 --> 02:54:54.230 align:start position:0%
state buildings where people can see
them

02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:54:57.230 --> 02:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
it at least raises awareness and maybe
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
they will go get the training on their
 
02:55:00.769 --> 02:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
own but I know there's a lot of people
 
02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
floating around because
 
02:55:06.170 --> 02:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
stop the bleed is similar to teaching
 
02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
CPR to the general public and a lot of
 
02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
public take these courses they have the
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge they just may not have the
 
02:55:15.410 --> 02:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
equipment on them when they run into one
 
02:55:18.250 --> 02:55:18.260 align:start position:0%
of these so having that available
 
02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:55:32.210 --> 02:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm assuming that um
 
02:55:35.389 --> 02:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
so like CPR you use that example and I
 
02:55:40.690 --> 02:55:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
working on a person who wasn't breathing
 
02:55:46.130 --> 02:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so I was getting instruction from
 
02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
the 911 operator over the phone so I'm
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
assuming in a situation like this if
 
02:55:51.170 --> 02:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
that kid's available somebody calls
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 that um that with this kind of a
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
coordinated effort that you've been
 
02:55:59.630 --> 02:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
doing all over the country that the 911
 
02:56:01.790 --> 02:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
operators would be able to help give
 
02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
people instructions is that true thank
 
02:56:05.570 --> 02:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
you for bringing that up it is
 
02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely true they have a uh flip
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
charts that can get to the specific
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
injuries and they can absolutely coach
 
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
you through putting on a tourniquick
 
02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
just seal or or an emergency bandage
 
02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.610 align:start position:0%
just seal or or an emergency bandage
absolutely

02:56:19.610 --> 02:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:56:21.889 --> 02:56:21.899 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:56:33.250 --> 02:56:33.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:35.389 --> 02:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
02:56:37.250 --> 02:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
speak with you today in support of this
 
02:56:39.410 --> 02:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
bill my name is Alexandra Briggs I'm a
 
02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
resident of lyme New Hampshire and I'm a
 
02:56:43.130 --> 02:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
trauma surgeon here in New Hampshire I'm
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
also a instructor for the stop the lead
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
course which you've heard about already
 
02:56:49.130 --> 02:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
which prepares people on how to control
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
baiting and how to save lives
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
as you've already heard bleeding is the
 
02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
number one cause of preventable death
 
02:56:57.290 --> 02:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
after injury and people can
 
02:56:58.730 --> 02:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately bleed to death in as
 
02:57:00.290 --> 02:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
little as five minutes and that's before
 
02:57:02.269 --> 02:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
any type of Emergency Services would be
 
02:57:03.769 --> 02:57:03.779 align:start position:0%
available to arrive
 
02:57:06.170 --> 02:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
by placing trauma kits in places that
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
are available to the people present at
 
02:57:09.230 --> 02:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
the time of an injury
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
you are providing an opportunity to save
 
02:57:12.110 --> 02:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
a life
 
02:57:13.849 --> 02:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
using the contents of the kit to stop
 
02:57:15.769 --> 02:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
bleeding and to allow an injured patient
 
02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
to get to definitive care like a care by
 
02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
myself or one of my colleagues is what
 
02:57:23.330 --> 02:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
they ultimately need but you would be
 
02:57:25.010 --> 02:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
able to help bystanders do this
 
02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:26.450 align:start position:0%
able to help bystanders do this
immediately

02:57:26.450 --> 02:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
publicly available instructions are easy
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
to follow the posters that are available
 
02:57:32.090 --> 02:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
from the stop the bleed kit and from
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
other organizations as you've heard
 
02:57:36.110 --> 02:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
many hospitals in our state and other
 
02:57:37.849 --> 02:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
organizations provide stop libid
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
training for very little cost or even
 
02:57:41.929 --> 02:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
free and it usually takes 60 to 90
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
minutes to go through one of these
 
02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
courses and be prepared to stop the
 
02:57:47.570 --> 02:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
bleeding while we'd all hope that these
 
02:57:49.690 --> 02:57:49.700 align:start position:0%
kids would be very rarely used of course
 
02:57:51.650 --> 02:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
emergencies do happen and it's
 
02:57:54.590 --> 02:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies of all kinds it's not just a
 
02:57:56.090 --> 02:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
shooting situation or a bombing
 
02:57:58.190 --> 02:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
situation it's an accident in the
 
02:57:59.690 --> 02:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
kitchen as someone's cutting a bagel in
 
02:58:02.530 --> 02:58:02.540 align:start position:0%
the morning or glass breaking or falling
 
02:58:05.450 --> 02:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
any of those things can happen
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
and so you know giving everybody the
 
02:58:10.190 --> 02:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help a colleague help a
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
friend help a family member another
 
02:58:13.610 --> 02:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
person in the public to help save their
 
02:58:15.469 --> 02:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
life is exactly what you'd be able to do
 
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
by placing these kits in public areas so
 
02:58:19.370 --> 02:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your attention and the
 
02:58:21.889 --> 02:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
ability to speak today and I'm happy to
 
02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
take any questions that I might be able
 
02:58:25.250 --> 02:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
to answer for you okay
 
02:58:27.170 --> 02:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions yeah
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
02:58:31.450 --> 02:58:31.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Dr uh I experienced not
 
02:58:40.130 --> 02:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
myself personally on my own body but I
 
02:58:43.370 --> 02:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
experienced one of these incidents of
 
02:58:45.969 --> 02:58:45.979 align:start position:0%
15 or 20 years ago when a cousin of mine
 
02:58:50.269 --> 02:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
had a glass pause of some sort that fell
 
02:58:55.849 --> 02:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
off of a shelf and and broke on the way
 
02:58:59.150 --> 02:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
down and and hit her in the in the arm
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
someplace and the blood was just so I'm
 
02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
sure that if I had not been there she
 
02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
would have led to death because
 
02:59:10.130 --> 02:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
she was that hand was completely
 
02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:12.290 align:start position:0%
she was that hand was completely
immobilized

02:59:12.290 --> 02:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
immobilized
 
02:59:15.710 --> 02:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and I had no idea what to do except
 
02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
but put a plastic
 
02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh red wrapper I think over her hand so
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't bleed on the floor got her
 
02:59:27.950 --> 02:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
into her car and went looking for a some
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
kind of an emergency this was in Fort
 
02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
Wayne Indiana
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
but but I and I know what it's like to
 
02:59:40.610 --> 02:59:40.620 align:start position:0%
see the blood gushing uh and so uh is it
 
02:59:45.650 --> 02:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
is the instruction worth mandating uh so
 
02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
that we would have an idea what to do in
 
02:59:50.330 --> 02:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
addition to having the kit
 
02:59:52.910 --> 02:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
or is it because like the Heimlich
 
02:59:54.889 --> 02:59:54.899 align:start position:0%
maneuver kind of everybody's heard of it
 
02:59:58.849 --> 02:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
I never had to try it that but is it is
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
it simple instruction that every House
 
03:00:03.230 --> 03:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
member should have
 
03:00:04.730 --> 03:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
I think it would be wonderful if
 
03:00:06.410 --> 03:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
everybody had that instruction I think
 
03:00:08.570 --> 03:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
mandating anything is very difficult but
 
03:00:10.370 --> 03:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
certainly encouraging people to get
 
03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
informed about it as was mentioned
 
03:00:14.809 --> 03:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
previously if you go to you know sites
 
03:00:15.950 --> 03:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
like the American College of Surgeons
 
03:00:17.929 --> 03:00:17.939 align:start position:0%
who have the stopwee program you can
 
03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
watch a video at home and get all of
 
03:00:21.889 --> 03:00:21.899 align:start position:0%
this knowledge just from watching it on
 
03:00:23.450 --> 03:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
your phone or on your computer and then
 
03:00:25.130 --> 03:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
go to a skill session to be able to
 
03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
practice it so it's something that's
 
03:00:28.790 --> 03:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
very easy to have access to and I would
 
03:00:30.349 --> 03:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
love to encourage everybody to become
 
03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about you know we live in
 
03:00:33.950 --> 03:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
a state where people are active out in
 
03:00:36.050 --> 03:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
the woods people hunt people hike people
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
do plenty of activities where these
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
types of incidents can happen and so the
 
03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
more people that know how to help the
 
03:00:43.250 --> 03:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
better I think people's instincts kick
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
in quickly as they did for you and the
 
03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
situation that you were in but having
 
03:00:48.290 --> 03:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
that extra piece of knowledge and then
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
with this legislation having additional
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
supplies available to help is always
 
03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:52.969 align:start position:0%
supplies available to help is always
helpful

03:00:52.969 --> 03:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
03:00:54.769 --> 03:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:01.370 --> 03:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Dr Briggs thank you
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
all right we have uh
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
the head of the EMS division here in
 
03:01:08.690 --> 03:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
case there are questions are there
 
03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:11.410 align:start position:0%
case there are questions are there
questions

03:01:11.410 --> 03:01:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:13.969 --> 03:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
okay you're not seeing any I think
 
03:01:15.790 --> 03:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
you've answered them very well
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
oh wow
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:01:25.969 --> 03:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.570 --> 03:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
hey not seeing any help close the
 
03:01:29.580 --> 03:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
hey not seeing any help close the
hearing

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:36.050 --> 03:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
representative goalie has a motion if
 
03:01:37.570 --> 03:01:37.580 align:start position:0%
you want to move to Executive session
 
03:01:41.630 --> 03:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay represent goalie
 
03:01:43.969 --> 03:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Madam chair I'd
 
03:01:46.370 --> 03:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
like to move ought to pass on Senate
 
03:01:51.230 --> 03:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
being a retired firefighter and working
 
03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
in the field of Ems for uh 32 and a half
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
years I have seen numerous occasions
 
03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:05.150 align:start position:0%
years I have seen numerous occasions
where

03:02:05.150 --> 03:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
kids like these
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
when they're available
 
03:02:12.610 --> 03:02:12.620 align:start position:0%
produce results and save lives
 
03:02:15.230 --> 03:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:02:17.389 --> 03:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
it's another tool along with the AED
 
03:02:20.450 --> 03:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
that can be used
 
03:02:23.170 --> 03:02:23.180 align:start position:0%
if placed properly around the state
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
and when needed are available
 
03:02:30.170 --> 03:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
there will be cards available to help
 
03:02:32.690 --> 03:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
show with instructions but I think an
 
03:02:34.490 --> 03:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
important point was brought forward by
 
03:02:36.650 --> 03:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative Gould that when someone's
 
03:02:39.469 --> 03:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
calling 9-1-1 those operators are
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
trained to direct someone on how to use
 
03:02:44.809 --> 03:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
these and how to properly apply a
 
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
as always when you have a major bleed
 
03:02:55.969 --> 03:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
incident time is of the essence and will
 
03:02:59.929 --> 03:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
save lives and when I look at the cost
 
03:02:59.939 --> 03:03:00.950 align:start position:0%
save lives and when I look at the cost
um

03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:03.050 --> 03:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:03:05.210 --> 03:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
put forward and I know we're not here to
 
03:03:06.290 --> 03:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
deal with the cost we're here to deal
 
03:03:08.349 --> 03:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
with the policy
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking at 340 to 440 locations
 
03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
we heard it would be 200 plus locations
 
03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
the cost I mean I did a quick look up of
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
already put together kit with all the
 
03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
items on here was 99 and I think if it
 
03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
was done
 
03:03:30.410 --> 03:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
by the state you could do it at a
 
03:03:33.290 --> 03:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
substantial savings and even in buying
 
03:03:36.349 --> 03:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
bulk so when you look at that it's
 
03:03:38.570 --> 03:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
roughly twenty thousand dollars is
 
03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
probably the initial cost and when we
 
03:03:42.290 --> 03:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
talk about saving lives I think it's a
 
03:03:44.570 --> 03:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
very good investment for the state thank
 
03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:45.530 align:start position:0%
very good investment for the state thank
you

03:03:45.530 --> 03:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:03:47.990 --> 03:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt
 
03:03:50.050 --> 03:03:50.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well
 
03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
excuse me so I've already related the
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
incident that occurred to my cousin when
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
I was standing right there and saw it
 
03:04:03.650 --> 03:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
happen uh and luckily uh uh I was there
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise she probably would have bled
 
03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
to death
 
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
but I I knew nothing about the
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
tremendous speed
 
03:04:16.130 --> 03:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
that such an incident can can wind up
 
03:04:18.530 --> 03:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
being fatal in
 
03:04:22.250 --> 03:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that it's not only the
 
03:04:25.849 --> 03:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
400 of us that could benefit from the
 
03:04:27.769 --> 03:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
knowledge and and having the kid
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
available but also there are members of
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
the public who come to our committee
 
03:04:37.090 --> 03:04:37.100 align:start position:0%
meetings and whether it but be by
 
03:04:37.100 --> 03:04:38.650 align:start position:0%
meetings and whether it but be by
potentially

03:04:38.650 --> 03:04:38.660 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:04:43.269 --> 03:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
an actual attack by someone with a knife
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
but we read virtually every day in the
 
03:04:49.969 --> 03:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
paper about stabbing incidents that
 
03:04:52.210 --> 03:04:52.220 align:start position:0%
happened especially in other countries
 
03:04:56.570 --> 03:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
but but even in an accident can be just
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
as fatal if you don't have an immediate
 
03:05:01.690 --> 03:05:01.700 align:start position:0%
recourse to
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
First Aid so I I think this is just like
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:05:11.690 --> 03:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
an AED someplace in the building uh
 
03:05:16.910 --> 03:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:20.090 --> 03:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
but but uh but this guy this is such a
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
simple thing the knowledge and a simple
 
03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:24.469 align:start position:0%
simple thing the knowledge and a simple
kit

03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
kit
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
I I think it's like so many other things
 
03:05:32.929 --> 03:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you not
 
03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
usually a big fan for spending money but
 
03:05:39.769 --> 03:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to support this
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I mean my experience is I'm a Farms
 
03:05:44.210 --> 03:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
instructor and a range safety officer
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
I've spent some thousands of hours
 
03:05:47.929 --> 03:05:47.939 align:start position:0%
running ranges and I've always had a kit
 
03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more than what what this is
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
um the other thing on people needing
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
training if a lot of restaurants have a
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
thing stuck up on the wall that's a kind
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
of pictorial thing on how to do the
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
heimlich maneuver I would suggest when
 
03:06:04.250 --> 03:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
they do this they do something similar
 
03:06:07.250 --> 03:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
so there's like a durable placard or
 
03:06:09.230 --> 03:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
something along with the kit and people
 
03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
who are just wandering by May glance at
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
it people are going to pick up
 
03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
information even though you know they'll
 
03:06:16.969 --> 03:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
have some idea and I think that'd be a
 
03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
good idea I certainly looked and read at
 
03:06:19.969 --> 03:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
the ones in restaurants for the Heimlich
 
03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
maneuver so
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I think I wouldn't want to mandate
 
03:06:26.210 --> 03:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
this on you know private businesses or
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
anything but this is a state taking
 
03:06:29.330 --> 03:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
responsibility for safety in our
 
03:06:32.330 --> 03:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
building so I could support this all
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
right other
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
other comments questions
 
03:06:38.450 --> 03:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Simon are you uh just
 
03:06:38.460 --> 03:06:40.150 align:start position:0%
representative Simon are you uh just
twiddling

03:06:40.150 --> 03:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
twiddling
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
fair enough we'll all twiddle together
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
careful with that thing we don't have
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
still ties are pretty good no problem
 
03:06:57.650 --> 03:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
archery application so anyway that
 
03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:02.590 align:start position:0%
archery application so anyway that
quality

03:07:02.590 --> 03:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
quality
 
03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
instructions and it's very easy so the
 
03:07:07.490 --> 03:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
placards are great and they're me and
 
03:07:10.010 --> 03:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
all the kids but everybody calls the
 
03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
same place for 9-1-1 because we have the
 
03:07:14.210 --> 03:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
pizza and all those operator are trained
 
03:07:17.150 --> 03:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
to provide that truck oh good to know we
 
03:07:20.630 --> 03:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
need advice in a hurry call 9101 and
 
03:07:22.730 --> 03:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
they'll help us figure it out
 
03:07:25.010 --> 03:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any more discussion the
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass by
 
03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and the clerk and
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Simon yes representative
 
03:07:41.929 --> 03:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
lakis yes representative Bailey yes
 
03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative true yes representative
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
Dolan yes representative yes
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard yes clerical GS
 
03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Grotto yes representative
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
Schmidt yes representative goalie yes
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative schuett yes
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Davis yes representative
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick yes representative Gould yes
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
and the chair
 
03:08:07.439 --> 03:08:09.110 align:start position:0%
and the chair
yes

03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
16 a zero name all right the motion
 
03:08:15.410 --> 03:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
passes 16-0 is there any objection to
 
03:08:15.420 --> 03:08:17.389 align:start position:0%
passes 16-0 is there any objection to
consent

03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
consent
 
03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
all right we'll put this on consent
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and when they form that advisory
 
03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee you could certainly recommend
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission that they
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
should cover this out of their own
 
03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:29.710 align:start position:0%
should cover this out of their own
budget

03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
I mean if the liquor stores are one of
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
the top priorities they are definitely a
 
03:08:38.809 --> 03:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.410 --> 03:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
1 30 and with perfect timing
 
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hearing on Senate
 
03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 207 and I don't have anybody who
 
03:08:56.110 --> 03:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
plans to testify on it uh Senator yes
 
03:09:01.610 --> 03:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:01.620 --> 03:09:04.490 align:start position:0%

03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay good morning Madam chair and
 
03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:09:12.410 --> 03:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
I am Senator Rebecca Perkins quoka
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 21 the city
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%

SB 207
 
03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
um an act establishing a committee to
 
03:09:22.969 --> 03:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
study licensure mental health
 
03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
professionals and relatives to mental
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
health critical incident intervention
 
03:09:30.010 --> 03:09:30.020 align:start position:0%
and management we'll do two things
 
03:09:32.809 --> 03:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
recreate a study committee I chaired to
 
03:09:35.330 --> 03:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
examine the state of licensure of mental
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
health professionals as well as make a
 
03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
technical correction to the EMS critical
 
03:09:42.530 --> 03:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
incident intervention and management
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
statute at the request of the first
 
03:09:47.330 --> 03:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
responder PTSD Commission
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
the 2022 study committee which
 
03:09:52.370 --> 03:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative gerd who joined me on
 
03:09:55.010 --> 03:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
um learned that the licensure of mental
 
03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
health professionals is very complex
 
03:09:58.010 --> 03:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
multi-layered issue that we
 
03:09:59.929 --> 03:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
unfortunately did not have time to fully
 
03:10:01.849 --> 03:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
explore we did make several
 
03:10:03.650 --> 03:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation which
 
03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
have been filed this year but there is
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
further opportunity to study aspects of
 
03:10:08.950 --> 03:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
this urgent challenge including
 
03:10:11.570 --> 03:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
reviewing licensure criteria for mental
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
health professionals regulated by
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
various state boards including how such
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
criteria relates to the requirements at
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
review the licensor process including
 
03:10:22.370 --> 03:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
how the statutory and Regulatory
 
03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
framework may impact the timely and
 
03:10:26.030 --> 03:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
efficient licensure of qualified
 
03:10:27.950 --> 03:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
applicants identifying and making
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations for joining available
 
03:10:31.490 --> 03:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
licensure compacts or adopting an
 
03:10:33.050 --> 03:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
endorsement model regarding mental
 
03:10:34.370 --> 03:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
health professionals
 
03:10:36.349 --> 03:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
exploring licensure barriers to
 
03:10:36.359 --> 03:10:37.610 align:start position:0%
exploring licensure barriers to
attracting

03:10:37.610 --> 03:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
attracting
 
03:10:39.469 --> 03:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
qualified mental health professionals to
 
03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and ensuring that the
 
03:10:44.090 --> 03:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
successful elements of 2020 emergency
 
03:10:48.170 --> 03:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
orders 8 15 and 18 have been
 
03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
incorporated into our statute another
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
year study will hopefully enable the
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
legislature 2024 to bring the remainder
 
03:10:57.050 --> 03:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
of the legislation that would address
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
this urgent topic
 
03:11:01.969 --> 03:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
um and to address the EMS critical
 
03:11:04.150 --> 03:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
incident intervention
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was brought forth in
 
03:11:08.929 --> 03:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
the Senate by Senator Birdsall is merely
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
to allow for peer-to-peer support within
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
the PTSD groups and the volunteer
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that support our First
 
03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
Responders so with that Madam chair I
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
will conclude and I'm happy to answer
 
03:11:24.410 --> 03:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Senator are
 
03:11:28.730 --> 03:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:31.130 --> 03:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
apparently not thank you very much thank
 
03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:33.650 align:start position:0%
apparently not thank you very much thank
you

03:11:33.650 --> 03:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.809 --> 03:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:11:45.050 --> 03:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.450 --> 03:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
03:11:49.250 --> 03:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:52.429 align:start position:0%
public hearing
and

03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.130 --> 03:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want to vote on it
 
03:11:58.190 --> 03:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
today because we already have a number
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
of things relative to mental health
 
03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:01.309 align:start position:0%
of things relative to mental health
licensure

03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at
 
03:12:03.359 --> 03:12:04.010 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at
um

03:12:04.010 --> 03:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:06.769 --> 03:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we want to add another
 
03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:12:10.190 --> 03:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
and I
 
03:12:12.170 --> 03:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
and I think I in fact want to get an
 
03:12:16.490 --> 03:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
amendment to to split this bill in half
 
03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
amendment to to split this bill in half
but

03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:20.510 --> 03:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should vote on it today
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent having served in the
 
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee the original purpose of the
 
03:12:30.410 --> 03:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
committee was to look at hurdles that
 
03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
could be removed to allow
 
03:12:33.779 --> 03:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
could be removed to allow
um

03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
more mental health professionals in our
 
03:12:40.429 --> 03:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
state and as a result of that City
 
03:12:42.590 --> 03:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
committee we came up with some some
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
ideas but there were so there were so
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
many Suggestions by the different boards
 
03:12:49.010 --> 03:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
that we thought
 
03:12:51.170 --> 03:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
it did not some of some of the
 
03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations were not in the purview
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the title of the study committee so
 
03:12:59.809 --> 03:12:59.819 align:start position:0%
that's why we um but we felt all of us
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
on the study we met quite often over the
 
03:13:04.610 --> 03:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
course this summer and we felt that
 
03:13:06.769 --> 03:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
there was enough dialogue between the
 
03:13:08.809 --> 03:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
study committee and those testifying
 
03:13:11.630 --> 03:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
that we should continue it but this is
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
of course before all this work with
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 and House Bill 2 came and
 
03:13:19.969 --> 03:13:19.979 align:start position:0%
so I agree that we should wait and just
 
03:13:23.330 --> 03:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
see how all this this shifts out in Edna
 
03:13:27.349 --> 03:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
because we've got quite a load of stuff
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
to look at in our committee so I agree
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not you know I although I
 
03:13:34.969 --> 03:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
value what the committee does and I
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
think that there's more work to be done
 
03:13:39.950 --> 03:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
but let's see what we can accomplish
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah between ourselves first well and
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
also the timing is such that
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's easier for us to work on it we
 
03:13:51.969 --> 03:13:51.979 align:start position:0%
could start tomorrow if we wish
 
03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
then wait for a committee to be formed
 
03:13:57.370 --> 03:13:57.380 align:start position:0%
so right
 
03:14:00.290 --> 03:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative right I agree I mean
 
03:14:03.050 --> 03:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see how things go it we
 
03:14:05.150 --> 03:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
have a retained bill that we're planning
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
on using for uh
 
03:14:09.170 --> 03:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
possible changes to Mental Health
 
03:14:11.630 --> 03:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
licensing and depending on the timing of
 
03:14:13.010 --> 03:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
everything it might make sense even to
 
03:14:14.690 --> 03:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
retain this until we're done with that
 
03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
and deal with them together possibly not
 
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
making a motion today but yeah we'll get
 
03:14:20.809 --> 03:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
something to think about yeah we'll keep
 
03:14:22.849 --> 03:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
it in in the back of our heads until
 
03:14:22.859 --> 03:14:25.429 align:start position:0%
it in in the back of our heads until
we're

03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:27.410 --> 03:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative so representative
 
03:14:30.230 --> 03:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
Lucas and I have have spoken and um
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
since he's going to be the chair of the
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
subcommittee looking at the mental
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
health boards and I'm going to be
 
03:14:38.570 --> 03:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
looking at House Bill 655 at House Bill
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
2. we thought we would have our our
 
03:14:44.210 --> 03:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings back to back so
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
that if someone wanted to stay for both
 
03:14:49.910 --> 03:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we could use lots of help so we're
 
03:14:51.889 --> 03:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
hoping that you'll all participate
 
03:14:58.730 --> 03:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
I just want to add that thank you for
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
having the peer support definition put
 
03:15:05.450 --> 03:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
in there I know for many of my
 
03:15:07.130 --> 03:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
constituents that has been a really
 
03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
important component in the big picture
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
of mental health in New Hampshire
 
03:15:14.090 --> 03:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
yeah well representative Schmidt thank
 
03:15:15.769 --> 03:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
you madam chair well you've already
 
03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
spoken about uh the idea of of uh having
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment to split the bill in half I
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
I agree with what's been said up to this
 
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
point with regard to the first aspect uh
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
but this mental health critical incident
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
intervention is clearly something that
 
03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
you see as separate and potentially
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
doable uh and if we have some
 
03:15:42.790 --> 03:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
discussions about what it involves
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
then uh I think we should start because
 
03:15:49.130 --> 03:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
I I don't I mean I can imagine the words
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
mean something to me but I don't have a
 
03:15:56.690 --> 03:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
vivid image of how this would look in
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
reality well I think we yes we can talk
 
03:16:02.450 --> 03:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
about it and I'm unless something comes
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
up to indicate that we need
 
03:16:07.730 --> 03:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
a specific study committee
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
I plan to
 
03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
just leave the peer-to-peer work in the
 
03:16:17.690 --> 03:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
bill and try and pass it and I'll do
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
that before the deadline
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
bring it to the committee for their uh
 
03:16:24.710 --> 03:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
review sounds like a plan thanks
 
03:16:28.190 --> 03:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
one else all right we have
 
03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
we are just too efficient
 
03:16:34.130 --> 03:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
the final hearing is at 2 15 so I hope
 
03:16:37.490 --> 03:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
most of you will return
 
03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's a quick question I picked up all
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
the stuff that was lying on the table at
 
03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the day but I whine
 
03:16:50.230 --> 03:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
I wind up with uh uh
 
03:16:53.570 --> 03:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
Senate built 105 which is not on the
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
agenda and no 53 which is so what's
 
03:16:58.969 --> 03:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:17:01.370 --> 03:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
our assistant reports that she is
 
03:17:03.230 --> 03:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
Distributing the Senate bills as she
 
03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
gets them uh-huh
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
so we we don't have 53. apparently not
 
03:17:11.090 --> 03:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
two times wait a minute some people have
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.050 --> 03:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
prepared statement uh you're gonna if
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you other questions
 
03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
I have a couple uh representative true
 
03:59:37.070 --> 03:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
you can go first thank you madam chair
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
03:59:42.410 --> 03:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
if the USC says you may use these
 
03:59:42.420 --> 03:59:46.070 align:start position:0%
if the USC says you may use these
refrigerants

03:59:46.070 --> 03:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:52.610 --> 03:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
um it's it's actually it's the this
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
current version of the state's building
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
code is what's prohibitive in this case
 
03:59:58.130 --> 03:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
because most States operate operate on
 
03:59:59.929 --> 03:59:59.939 align:start position:0%
like a three-year building code adoption
 
04:00:02.929 --> 04:00:02.939 align:start position:0%
cycle some operate on Sixth year some
 
04:00:04.130 --> 04:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
don't even have a State Building Code
 
04:00:06.050 --> 04:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
altogether and so
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
um when they're adopting new verses of
 
04:00:09.170 --> 04:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
building codes they're using the latest
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
ICC model codes that come out and these
 
04:00:14.929 --> 04:00:14.939 align:start position:0%
new refrigerants aren't listed in until
 
04:00:18.050 --> 04:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
the 2024 Edition that just came out from
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
the ICC this year so what this is doing
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
is basically just kind of getting a
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
bridge giving a bridge to manufacturers
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and otherwise to
 
04:00:29.630 --> 04:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
get them until get them to the point
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
where those codes will eventually be
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
adopted it may be six years before that
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
happens so this is just a temporary Way
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
by going into the building code itself
 
04:00:42.410 --> 04:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're smooth transition
 
04:00:44.990 --> 04:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I have some questions so
 
04:00:48.290 --> 04:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
these are these alternate refrigerants
 
04:00:51.650 --> 04:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
are in the 2024 building codes yes ma'am
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
chair okay and we are in the 18
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
considering going to 2021
 
04:00:59.809 --> 04:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:00:59.819 --> 04:01:01.849 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:01:01.849 --> 04:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:03.530 --> 04:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
I've got some
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
correspondence from the State Fire
 
04:01:07.010 --> 04:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
Marshal and the building code review
 
04:01:10.729 --> 04:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
board who are very concerned that the
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
these refrigerants are much more
 
04:01:15.250 --> 04:01:15.260 align:start position:0%
flammable than the current versions
 
04:01:23.389 --> 04:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.450 --> 04:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
so low gwp refrigerants which is what we
 
04:01:28.729 --> 04:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
refer to these refrigerants as low
 
04:01:30.410 --> 04:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
Global boring potential
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
um you are they are they are flammable
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
it's a low flammability rating we refer
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
to them as a2ls so that's the second
 
04:01:40.370 --> 04:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
lowest uh flameability rating that these
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
refrigerants could be given
 
04:01:42.479 --> 04:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
refrigerants could be given
um

04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
we uh invested over seven million
 
04:01:47.809 --> 04:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
dollars in Safety Research on these
 
04:01:47.819 --> 04:01:48.969 align:start position:0%
dollars in Safety Research on these
refrigerants

04:01:48.969 --> 04:01:48.979 align:start position:0%
refrigerants
 
04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
and the research findings have been used
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
to upgrade the safety standards and to
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
protect our customers and stakeholders
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
more than uh 80 percent
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
to to
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
couple it to another industry over 80
 
04:02:06.290 --> 04:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
percent of the of the cars that are
 
04:02:09.050 --> 04:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
being sold right now in the U.S are
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
using these same refrigerants in their
 
04:02:13.010 --> 04:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
air conditioning systems
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so we um again have uh training
 
04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
materials developed by the fire service
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
and we are coming up with a new
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum to give to contractors to
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that they safely handles up
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
suit refrigerants
 
04:02:29.279 --> 04:02:31.250 align:start position:0%
suit refrigerants
okay

04:02:31.250 --> 04:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:32.769 --> 04:02:32.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about
 
04:02:35.929 --> 04:02:35.939 align:start position:0%
residences because in box in commercial
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
too in most cases your refrigerators are
 
04:02:40.670 --> 04:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
right next to your stoves
 
04:02:44.809 --> 04:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
and so if you had a refrigerant leak
 
04:02:47.929 --> 04:02:47.939 align:start position:0%
you're exposed to Fire and
 
04:02:50.809 --> 04:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
are there additional requirements that
 
04:02:53.330 --> 04:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
are generated by virtue of this like
 
04:02:56.689 --> 04:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
sprinklers or fire suppression systems
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
no they're uh nothing fire suppression
 
04:03:01.439 --> 04:03:02.570 align:start position:0%
no they're uh nothing fire suppression
related

04:03:02.570 --> 04:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
related
 
04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
um but obviously as the as the new 2024
 
04:03:07.010 --> 04:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
codes come out they're going to have
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
relevant safety standards relevant
 
04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
Federal safety standards on how to you
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
know install them how to maintain them
 
04:03:16.689 --> 04:03:16.699 align:start position:0%
how to safely manage these refrigerants
 
04:03:19.729 --> 04:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
so do you want us to allow them without
 
04:03:21.769 --> 04:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
that sort of information
 
04:03:26.330 --> 04:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh no they have as as this as the 2024
 
04:03:29.090 --> 04:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
ICC codes come out they are tied to
 
04:03:30.889 --> 04:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations as well as common
 
04:03:32.929 --> 04:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
engineering ashrae
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
um standards that are there for safety
 
04:03:35.399 --> 04:03:38.750 align:start position:0%
um standards that are there for safety
measures

04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
and are those codes available now yes
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you other representative Schmidt
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh our hfcs
 
04:03:48.840 --> 04:03:50.929 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh our hfcs
flammable

04:03:50.929 --> 04:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
flammable
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh they are mildly flammable these are
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
more flammable but to put in perspective
 
04:04:00.290 --> 04:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
they have the new a2l refrigerants have
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
about the same flameability as like
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
olive oil so if you really hold a torch
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
to it you know you could eventually get
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
it to ignite but it's not something that
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
just you know with one spark you know
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
can cause a disaster it's it would have
 
04:04:16.370 --> 04:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
to take a sustained flame on this
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
refrigerant in order to get to well the
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
thing is that this stuff is gonna is
 
04:04:23.510 --> 04:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
gonna be a gas in the system or is there
 
04:04:25.610 --> 04:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
going to be a liquid in the system the
 
04:04:28.010 --> 04:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
new the new chemicals yep it's a liquid
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's a liquid in other words it's not
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
out there as a gas you know
 
04:04:35.570 --> 04:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
no no no no yeah it is it is and it
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
operates in a closed system
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:04:40.910 --> 04:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously when there are
 
04:04:42.830 --> 04:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
leaks they're usually small especially
 
04:04:44.990 --> 04:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
on a residential scale
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
um but again the flammability is
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
considered low and this all goes through
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
when these new refrigerants are
 
04:04:53.030 --> 04:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured they have to go through not
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
only the EPA but they have to go through
 
04:04:58.969 --> 04:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
um uh OSHA as well to be checked for
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
safety standards for use in commercial
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
applications so there's multiple
 
04:05:06.370 --> 04:05:06.380 align:start position:0%
agencies and multiple bodies working on
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
the safety aspects and the ins you know
 
04:05:10.849 --> 04:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
safe installation of these follow-up
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair so the thing is this is the
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee that handles the building
 
04:05:17.570 --> 04:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
codes when they come uh into the
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislature for approval so we have a
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
number of members who have experience
 
04:05:26.090 --> 04:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
with some of these things and so we have
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
some level of of sophistication with
 
04:05:32.050 --> 04:05:32.060 align:start position:0%
regard so I mean grain dust for example
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh is explosive there are things that
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
are explosive and you're telling me that
 
04:05:39.290 --> 04:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
this that closed system and it's going
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be in there as a liquid and therefore
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna if it the chairs ask
 
04:05:47.570 --> 04:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
about what if there's a leak well if
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's a leak it's going to be as a
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
liquid and not as a as a gas in other
 
04:05:51.960 --> 04:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
liquid and not as a as a gas in other
words

04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh it could be well
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
the new refrigerants can be either
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
liquid or they could be gas but most
 
04:06:01.610 --> 04:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
common application and residential
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
applications is is
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
um is a coolant type refrigerant
 
04:06:09.170 --> 04:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay well defer to my colleagues for
 
04:06:12.410 --> 04:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
further questions represent icus
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you so are you saying that at
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know standard pressure and room
 
04:06:18.650 --> 04:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
temperature this stuff is a liquid I'm
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
skeptical about that no I mean so if it
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
leaked out into the room would it leak
 
04:06:24.000 --> 04:06:25.010 align:start position:0%
leaked out into the room would it leak
out

04:06:25.010 --> 04:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
as a either a gas or as a liquid that
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
would boil into a gas at standard room
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
conditions yes it it could again but
 
04:06:35.450 --> 04:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not explosive that's the
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's the key it's not this is an
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
explosive gas or liquid it's flammable
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
and the a2l designation that's given to
 
04:06:42.660 --> 04:06:43.729 align:start position:0%
and the a2l designation that's given to
it

04:06:43.729 --> 04:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
um by the federal government indicates
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
that 2L means the second low
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
flammability rate there's a 1l 2L and it
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
keeps moving up from there so thank you
 
04:06:58.610 --> 04:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Broda
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
okay so I think you just confirmed so
 
04:07:05.450 --> 04:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
the material is rated as a two a2l so
 
04:07:10.210 --> 04:07:10.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:15.410 --> 04:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
considerations for fire safety and for
 
04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
installation so how do we know that by
 
04:07:21.410 --> 04:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
inserting this
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
how do we know that our current building
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
codes take into consideration those
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
safety measures if we're going to allow
 
04:07:33.410 --> 04:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
that refrigerant so the the codes refer
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
to existing
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
standards and existing so I mentioned
 
04:07:41.570 --> 04:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
ashrae standard 90.1 is the is the um
 
04:07:44.809 --> 04:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
yeah I should like to point out that in
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we cannot say that we're
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
going with the current version of
 
04:07:53.090 --> 04:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
anything we have to explicitly approve a
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
specific edition of a rule or regulation
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
or a standard before we can put it into
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
law so that
 
04:08:05.889 --> 04:08:05.899 align:start position:0%
you may this this
 
04:08:09.410 --> 04:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
standard may or may not be what's in our
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
current building code
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
and if it is not it needs to be
 
04:08:15.410 --> 04:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
officially added to our building code
 
04:08:17.929 --> 04:08:17.939 align:start position:0%
yes it and it will be we work on the
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory side as well you know to the
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
reason why we pursued legislation in
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
certain States just because the building
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
code cycle isn't lining up with the
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
federal phase down so there are some
 
04:08:28.610 --> 04:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
states where right now we're just
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
working through traditional building
 
04:08:32.570 --> 04:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
code process because
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it just happened to line up that way
 
04:08:35.630 --> 04:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire is not one of those
 
04:08:39.889 --> 04:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
States in fact I'm working in 27 this
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
year getting prepared for this
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
transition that begins July 1 2024.
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so there we have a whole regulatory
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
team that's working on that end with the
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
safety standards engineering standards
 
04:08:51.840 --> 04:08:53.210 align:start position:0%
safety standards engineering standards
um

04:08:53.210 --> 04:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:56.090 --> 04:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
so you're if I understand you correctly
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this is a year in
 
04:09:00.769 --> 04:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
advance of actually having that sort of
 
04:09:02.889 --> 04:09:02.899 align:start position:0%
data available
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.929 --> 04:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
I I guess Madam chair can you rephrase
 
04:09:11.809 --> 04:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
the question what data
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
the standards the building codes the
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
safety procedures Etc will not be
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
available for adoption or will not be
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
effective until
 
04:09:26.090 --> 04:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
over a year from now is that correct
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
it would depend on when the state of New
 
04:09:31.729 --> 04:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted the 2020 and they
 
04:09:33.290 --> 04:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't have to it doesn't have to be they
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
could take aspects of the 2024 model
 
04:09:35.279 --> 04:09:36.250 align:start position:0%
could take aspects of the 2024 model
code

04:09:36.250 --> 04:09:36.260 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:09:40.610 --> 04:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
is accelerating we will adopt the 2024
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
building code approximately in 2027. we
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
prefer to be one cycle behind so the
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
bugs can come out yep
 
04:09:48.720 --> 04:09:49.969 align:start position:0%
bugs can come out yep
so

04:09:49.969 --> 04:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:51.769 --> 04:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's four years ahead ahead of when we
 
04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
would adopt the building code
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so again we've you know we work
 
04:10:02.269 --> 04:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
with a variety of you know of our
 
04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
partner engineering organizations to
 
04:10:06.889 --> 04:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
ensure you know the safety standards are
 
04:10:08.570 --> 04:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
up to date
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that's a whole effort outside of what
 
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
I'm doing
 
04:10:13.849 --> 04:10:13.859 align:start position:0%
um but what it comes down to is
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically you know the the federal
 
04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
government is telling us we need to use
 
04:10:19.729 --> 04:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
these new refrigerants
 
04:10:21.290 --> 04:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
and they're going to start restricting
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
the supply next year in 2024 and if
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
these refrigerants aren't listed in New
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's building code we can't sell
 
04:10:28.849 --> 04:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
equipment here and so that's everything
 
04:10:31.490 --> 04:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
from residential you know air
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
conditioning units to Commercial
 
04:10:36.530 --> 04:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration for hospitals restaurants
 
04:10:38.929 --> 04:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
um it's really put let's put it this way
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're so invested in this as an industry
 
04:10:44.929 --> 04:10:44.939 align:start position:0%
that we're we're we're trying trying to
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
get this fixed by the end of the year in
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
27 different states I'm running all over
 
04:10:50.570 --> 04:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
the place I mean Maryland right now
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island they're all
 
04:10:54.650 --> 04:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
um considering the same legislation
 
04:10:55.729 --> 04:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
because they're again their building
 
04:10:58.010 --> 04:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
code cycle doesn't line up with the EPA
 
04:10:58.020 --> 04:10:59.689 align:start position:0%
code cycle doesn't line up with the EPA
timeline

04:10:59.689 --> 04:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
04:11:01.490 --> 04:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for interrupting you
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative I think you what you said
 
04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
to me was so if we didn't we don't adopt
 
04:11:06.540 --> 04:11:07.729 align:start position:0%
to me was so if we didn't we don't adopt
this

04:11:07.729 --> 04:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
the current things that were that that
 
04:11:13.370 --> 04:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
are being installed in our homes and
 
04:11:13.380 --> 04:11:14.750 align:start position:0%
are being installed in our homes and
businesses

04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
those models are going to be
 
04:11:17.040 --> 04:11:18.590 align:start position:0%
those models are going to be
discontinued

04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
discontinued
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
well they're going to still remain on
 
04:11:22.490 --> 04:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
the EPA it's called a snap list of like
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
approved approved refrigerants they're
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to remain on there what's going to
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
happen in in practice would be so if a
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
state didn't adopt these changes to the
 
04:11:31.739 --> 04:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
state didn't adopt these changes to the
code

04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
we would get to July 1st 2024 and they
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
may not feel it at that point
 
04:11:39.410 --> 04:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
immediately because there's still going
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of stock of the current
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
equipment out there but as you know that
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
equipment quickly gets bought up because
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
people have say Surplus refrigerant or
 
04:11:52.490 --> 04:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
they have you know eventually it's going
 
04:11:55.610 --> 04:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
to create scarcity and once those once
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
that current equipment runs out starting
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
in 2025 our manufacturers can't even put
 
04:12:05.650 --> 04:12:05.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
yeah that was my follow-up so you're
 
04:12:09.650 --> 04:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
saying that after a certain amount of
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
time the refrigerant
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
the refrigerants that we use
 
04:12:16.370 --> 04:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
in the equipment that we buy now will
 
04:12:18.290 --> 04:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
not be available is that what you're
 
04:12:19.969 --> 04:12:19.979 align:start position:0%
saying yes yes
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay well I think
 
04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
about it yes thank you representative
 
04:12:23.939 --> 04:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
about it yes thank you representative
Schmidt

04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair so did these
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
issues come up in the Senate when when
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
the bill was heard there
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
no uh we had a couple couple questions
 
04:12:33.840 --> 04:12:34.969 align:start position:0%
no uh we had a couple couple questions
but

04:12:34.969 --> 04:12:34.979 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
um again
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
because we're doing this across the
 
04:12:38.880 --> 04:12:39.790 align:start position:0%
because we're doing this across the
country

04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know we have a lot of other examples
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
to to kind of show from where this has
 
04:12:49.250 --> 04:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
been a success like last year and and
 
04:12:51.050 --> 04:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
not only that I'll note that so this is
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
one of the rare issues where like
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
industry and the environmental Community
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
are also aligned on it right so we have
 
04:12:59.330 --> 04:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce is one of the
 
04:13:02.150 --> 04:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
endorsers of this legislation and so is
 
04:13:03.710 --> 04:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
the Sierra Club and League conservation
 
04:13:05.090 --> 04:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
voters so from an environmental
 
04:13:05.100 --> 04:13:06.590 align:start position:0%
voters so from an environmental
standpoint

04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the impact is is going to be
 
04:13:10.610 --> 04:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
significant from our sector I think it's
 
04:13:12.650 --> 04:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to reduce our greenhouse gas
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
emissions from refrigerants by 75
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
percent over the next 15 years
 
04:13:17.760 --> 04:13:19.370 align:start position:0%
percent over the next 15 years
um

04:13:19.370 --> 04:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:24.050 --> 04:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
this also this this sounds good in in
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
terms of going in One Direction but the
 
04:13:29.450 --> 04:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
flammability and explosive aspect is uh
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing we don't want to kind
 
04:13:35.150 --> 04:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
of go ah what could happen yeah boom
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
Could Happen well probably not Boomers
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
probably probably not but I mean you you
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
understand we have a responsibility to
 
04:13:45.889 --> 04:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
make a responsible decision on this and
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
and we got questions
 
04:13:47.580 --> 04:13:48.950 align:start position:0%
and we got questions
absolutely

04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I will say when we're going through
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
the code adoption process with on the
 
04:13:55.010 --> 04:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
regulatory side we're working hand in
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
hand with the Fire Marshal's office
 
04:13:59.090 --> 04:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
because they you know are part of the
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
building code adoption process
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
um they weigh in on all these issues and
 
04:14:09.530 --> 04:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
um we really again we've invested a lot
 
04:14:11.570 --> 04:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
of money you know seven million dollars
 
04:14:14.090 --> 04:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
into training for firefighters for fire
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
safety public officials
 
04:14:19.370 --> 04:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and you know
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
again it's it's not I don't want it to
 
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
be class uh class classified as
 
04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
explosive it's just it's it's flammable
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're glad of the difference
 
04:14:32.210 --> 04:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I just wanted
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
to clarify that with reparations briefly
 
04:14:38.689 --> 04:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
on the explosiveness versus flammability
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
there is a big difference on those
 
04:14:40.199 --> 04:14:41.330 align:start position:0%
there is a big difference on those
issues

04:14:41.330 --> 04:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:14:44.330 --> 04:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
um in classifications but I want to get
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
back to the bill itself
 
04:14:50.210 --> 04:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
and when I look at this
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
that as we go forward this just states
 
04:14:53.040 --> 04:14:55.130 align:start position:0%
that as we go forward this just states
that

04:14:55.130 --> 04:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
the product line coming forward
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be prohibited I mean it
 
04:15:02.570 --> 04:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it has to be brought in it
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it has to be out there
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
and from what I'm seeing as I looked at
 
04:15:08.640 --> 04:15:10.610 align:start position:0%
and from what I'm seeing as I looked at
briefly

04:15:10.610 --> 04:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
the 42 USC 7671 code and policy of the
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
code is
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the maximum extent applicable class 1
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
and Class 2 substances shall be replaced
 
04:15:23.210 --> 04:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
by chemical product substitutes or
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
alternative manufacturing processes that
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
reduce the overall risk to human health
 
04:15:31.370 --> 04:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
and the environment and that is clearly
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do here
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
yes and and at its simplest form it's
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
basically saying all EPA approved
 
04:15:41.929 --> 04:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
refrigerants are able to be used in the
 
04:15:44.330 --> 04:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:15:46.130 --> 04:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so that's basically what the
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislation does just says if it's
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
approved by the EPA as a as a approved
 
04:15:53.929 --> 04:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
refrigerant it could be used in
 
04:15:56.210 --> 04:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
equipment that's sold here and installed
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
here in in New Hampshire which again
 
04:16:00.110 --> 04:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um you know all of the new equipment
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2025 is going to be using
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
these new AP um EPA approved substitutes
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
follow us follow-up please and and just
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
as I follow up reading this it stays
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
specifically and I'm sure this is I'm
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
assuming this has been all through the
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
EPA as well is that
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
refrigerant shall be listed in and
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
installed in accordance with the safety
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
standards which I'm sure are probably
 
04:16:27.960 --> 04:16:29.450 align:start position:0%
standards which I'm sure are probably
already

04:16:29.450 --> 04:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:16:32.750 --> 04:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
recognized and placed out there for yes
 
04:16:36.110 --> 04:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
those installing thank you
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you madam chair
 
04:16:41.640 --> 04:16:42.349 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you madam chair
um

04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:45.650 --> 04:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
do these new refrigerants work in all of
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
the existing equipment refrigerators air
 
04:16:48.239 --> 04:16:49.849 align:start position:0%
the existing equipment refrigerators air
conditioners

04:16:49.849 --> 04:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
conditioners
 
04:16:49.859 --> 04:16:51.170 align:start position:0%
conditioners
now

04:16:51.170 --> 04:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so representative the the current
 
04:16:55.969 --> 04:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
equipment that's out there is going to
 
04:16:58.910 --> 04:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
be still going to need to use hfc based
 
04:16:58.920 --> 04:17:00.710 align:start position:0%
be still going to need to use hfc based
refrigerant

04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
refrigerant
 
04:17:02.809 --> 04:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
um all the new stuff will have the new
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerants in it but you can't you
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
can't utilize the new refrigerants in
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
Old equipment it's specifically
 
04:17:09.969 --> 04:17:09.979 align:start position:0%
engineered for the new equipment
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
so for all of the people that have the
 
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
current equipment
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying there's going to be a
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
supply problem for them going forward
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
well there's part of the so this is
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
going to happen over a 15-year period
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
the transition and part of the epa's
 
04:17:31.389 --> 04:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
plan is to keep 15 of
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
the reserve of these existing
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
refrigerants in reserve to service all
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
the current equipment
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
but the new refrigerants will eventually
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
or the old refrigerants current
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
refrigerants they will be obviously
 
04:17:50.210 --> 04:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
people are going to be buying them
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
they're not being produced anymore so
 
04:17:53.929 --> 04:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
whatever's out there on the market is
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:18:00.170 --> 04:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
very hard
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just curious as to
 
04:18:04.370 --> 04:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
the timeline these new refrigerants how
 
04:18:06.290 --> 04:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
long have they been out and how much do
 
04:18:07.490 --> 04:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
we know about them I'm just thinking you
 
04:18:09.050 --> 04:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
know government proving DDT and stuff
 
04:18:10.490 --> 04:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
like that are we actually making the
 
04:18:12.110 --> 04:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
situation worse or is this stuff time
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
tested and there's no question about it
 
04:18:17.150 --> 04:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we this has been tested for over 10
 
04:18:20.689 --> 04:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
years now both by our association so our
 
04:18:23.530 --> 04:18:23.540 align:start position:0%
association isn't just advocacy we also
 
04:18:26.330 --> 04:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
develop uh safety standards product
 
04:18:26.340 --> 04:18:27.670 align:start position:0%
develop uh safety standards product
certification

04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
so we've we've been engaged with other
 
04:18:33.769 --> 04:18:33.779 align:start position:0%
entities like ashrae
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
um is the main one to to come up with
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
a plan to transition these in safe way
 
04:18:41.929 --> 04:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
make sure we have all the safety
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
standards in place and try to make the
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
transition as smooth as we can thank you
 
04:18:50.090 --> 04:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
and just follow up and the cost is equal
 
04:18:53.450 --> 04:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
yes the cost is equal in fact uh only
 
04:18:56.150 --> 04:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
one percent of the cost of new equipment
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
is the refrigerant
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
so compared to previously
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's always been it's always typically
 
04:19:04.130 --> 04:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
one percent of total cost is the
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
refrigerant that's in the in the system
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you okay other questions
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
I have representative true
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
04:19:15.479 --> 04:19:16.010 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
um

04:19:16.010 --> 04:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
how many new refrigerants are there or
 
04:19:21.769 --> 04:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
is there just one class of new
 
04:19:25.370 --> 04:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
refrigerant allow the multiple classes
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
of new refrigerant
 
04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh there are multiple classes of
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
refrigerants and there's Pro and there's
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
hundreds of new substitute alternative
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
refrigerants that are coming out to the
 
04:19:36.120 --> 04:19:36.830 align:start position:0%
refrigerants that are coming out to the
market

04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:19:38.450 --> 04:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them are manufactured here
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
here in the US
 
04:19:43.130 --> 04:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else questions I have
 
04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
one question uh what's the hurry why do
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
you want it to go into effect 60 days
 
04:19:51.050 --> 04:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
instead of as of
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2024.
 
04:19:57.410 --> 04:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
well ideally Madam chair we're trying to
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
give our manufacturers as much lead time
 
04:20:01.729 --> 04:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
as possible because of we need our
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers need to look at sort of
 
04:20:05.210 --> 04:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
the on a national scale where they're
 
04:20:06.410 --> 04:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
going to be able to sell equipment and
 
04:20:08.570 --> 04:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
where they're not and shift and allocate
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
Supply chains accordingly so you know
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
ideally we're trying to get them enough
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
time so we can be sure and have the
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
certainty that we could sell the
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
equipment in New Hampshire
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
um rather than waiting until right
 
04:20:23.450 --> 04:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
before the deadline when we probably
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
have already shifted supplies to other
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
states that are accepting them
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
baby bear
 
04:20:33.650 --> 04:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
it's more of a follow-on question to
 
04:20:36.530 --> 04:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
chair McGuire's question so if this was
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
not approved would there be a shortage
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
of equipment
 
04:20:43.130 --> 04:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I think yes there'd be
 
04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
a short of equipment and a shortage of
 
04:20:45.060 --> 04:20:52.250 align:start position:0%
a short of equipment and a shortage of
refrigerants

04:20:52.250 --> 04:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.410 --> 04:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's the last card I had does anyone
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify on Senate bill 53.
 
04:21:00.290 --> 04:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
all right seeing
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll close the hearing
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative true sorry you thank you
 
04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:21:09.050 --> 04:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
did I hear you say that New Hampshire
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
code doesn't allow us to say yeah
 
04:21:13.010 --> 04:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
whatever they said we agree with that
 
04:21:14.689 --> 04:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
that we have to list all these
 
04:21:14.699 --> 04:21:16.990 align:start position:0%
that we have to list all these
refrigerants

04:21:16.990 --> 04:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
refrigerants
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
are we could adopt a later version of
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the federal standard which would list
 
04:21:25.849 --> 04:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
all of the with your list of criteria
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
more likely
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
um but yes we have to specifically
 
04:21:33.050 --> 04:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
identify federal regulations that we are
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to comply with it's in the
 
04:21:35.040 --> 04:21:38.030 align:start position:0%
going to comply with it's in the
Constitution

04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
anyone I don't think we're ready to uh
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
exec this today do you yes no I would
 
04:21:47.809 --> 04:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
like to I'm surprised because we have a
 
04:21:47.819 --> 04:21:48.530 align:start position:0%
like to I'm surprised because we have a
pretty

04:21:48.530 --> 04:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:21:48.540 --> 04:21:50.269 align:start position:0%
pretty
um

04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
proactive Fire Marshal so I would have
 
04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
thought that if there were concerns he
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
would have been here or they would have
 
04:21:59.809 --> 04:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
been here so if there's a way of getting
 
04:22:02.570 --> 04:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
confirmation I think that's you know I'd
 
04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
like to see that because
 
04:22:08.210 --> 04:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
I don't want to impinge
 
04:22:08.220 --> 04:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
I don't want to impinge
um

04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:13.010 --> 04:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know progress in fact in the way you
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
know into applying things to people to
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I'd like to know more
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
about what their concern is and so I
 
04:22:23.210 --> 04:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
think that's if they're here to tell us
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
that their concern is you know teeny
 
04:22:28.010 --> 04:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
teeny teeny then it helps us as opposed
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
to oh yeah we need to change things so
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
right so let me think we will send this
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
to some committee
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
um who would be appropriate
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
well your representative Simon your
 
04:22:42.050 --> 04:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is not overburdened at the
 
04:22:42.060 --> 04:22:42.849 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is not overburdened at the
moment

04:22:42.849 --> 04:22:42.859 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:22:47.630 --> 04:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
so why don't you take this and make sure
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
to get the fire marshal and the building
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
code Review Board in to explain their
 
04:22:51.479 --> 04:22:52.610 align:start position:0%
code Review Board in to explain their
concerns

04:22:52.610 --> 04:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:22:56.090 --> 04:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah it is we
 
04:22:59.570 --> 04:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
we as a legislator have decided not to
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
adopt the latest code as soon as it's
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
available because there's frequently
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh errors that the early adopters will
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
find out for us so I'd like to at least
 
04:23:13.969 --> 04:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
have a meeting on this before we do
 
04:23:16.130 --> 04:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
anything with it
 
04:23:18.769 --> 04:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:23:23.570 --> 04:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
okay well the thing is Mr uruzi is that
 
04:23:26.929 --> 04:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
yeah so he's obviously extremely
 
04:23:29.809 --> 04:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and well prepared and his
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
testimony was very elucidating but I
 
04:23:35.170 --> 04:23:35.180 align:start position:0%
think we all have a certain amount of
 
04:23:37.610 --> 04:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
uncertainty with regard to whether we
 
04:23:39.490 --> 04:23:39.500 align:start position:0%
shouldn't ask a couple more questions
 
04:23:42.889 --> 04:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
especially involving the fire marshal in
 
04:23:45.050 --> 04:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
his office and I hope you will be able
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
to support our subcommittee meeting
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
we would we would appreciate your
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge all right in that case that's
 
04:23:55.250 --> 04:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
all we have scheduled for today we are
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
coming back tomorrow at 10 o'clock
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:08.279 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
