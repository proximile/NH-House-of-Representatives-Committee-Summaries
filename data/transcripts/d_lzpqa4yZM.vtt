housekeeping uh
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
we have been remiss in the fact that we
 
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
do not have a committee Clerk
 
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 align:start position:0%
and I would like to uh well
 
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo is not here yet
 
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
and was she did she notify anybody that

she was not going to be here
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
I know I I uh I gotta I gotta eat text
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
from some representative Wilhelm
 
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
I have to remember I can't call him that
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
in meeting okay these I have to be
 
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.810 align:start position:0%
in meeting okay these I have to be
formal

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
and uh yes I'm going to ask
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo to be our uh
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
committee Clerk
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I would hope she would say yes uh
 
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
that's first the first bit of
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
housekeeping the second bit of
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
housekeeping is the next two meetings
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
we'll start at 1 pm
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
they will hopefully be finished by 3 pm
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
because for me to make morning meetings
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
as you have already seen
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
is tough for me because I have other
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
so in order to make that official we
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
have to have a clerk who takes notes
 
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.110 align:start position:0%
have to have a clerk who takes notes
so

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
all right uh we are here today primarily
 
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.950 align:start position:0%
all right uh we are here today primarily
uh

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
two there we are
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
I representative that's that's fine I
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
would I was advised that you might be a
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
touch a touch late
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
but that's okay uh
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask you if you would
 
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
consider being our committee Clerk
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
so thank you we appreciate that do we
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
have to vote on that
 
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.170 align:start position:0%
have to vote on that
no

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay you are duly appointed
 
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay our meetings from now on are going
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
to be from that the next two are going
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
to be at one o'clock on Monday not in
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 align:start position:0%
because a lot of us have way other stuff
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
and some of us that are oh as old as me
 
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
takes a while to get that motor running
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
Monday morning
 
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.150 align:start position:0%
Monday morning
so

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
one of our one of our primary purposes
 
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 align:start position:0%
today is to have Dave aluconis
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
Enlighten us and try to help us come up
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
with a framework
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
for the drafting attorneys to help them
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
get through all the knot holes that they
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
have to get through
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
so Dave I know you say you had some
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
information for us so
 
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.409 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have brought
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
with me today uh two of our drafting
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
attorneys we have Courtney esbar and
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hannah and Jack here uh to also answer
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
questions why don't you guys come right
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
just move the microphone as necessary I
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
I did send this uh information out uh
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
this is the same as I send out by email
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
if anyone would like paper copies we're
 
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
and what you'll find in that packet
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
again that's the same as I sent out by
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
email last week is an excerpt from our
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
drafting manual concerning uh the
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
writing of these bills and then most of
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
this is uh also accepted from uh the
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
manual in the appendices which are
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
examples of commissions and committees
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
and things like that so this is what
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
guides us in
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:38.899 align:start position:0%
Courtney sure
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
the front line one of the front line
 
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:44.660 align:start position:0%
dealing with the members coming in
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
so my name is Courtney eschbach I'm one
 
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
of the drafting attorneys in the office
 
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
of legislative Services I've been in
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
there for 18 years
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
um study committees usually what happens
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
is a member will come in and request a
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
study committee or a study commission
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about exactly what that
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
member wants to study I'll give an
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
example because I've worked on it for a
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
few years there's been a study committee
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
on dog grooming regulations
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
um and so at that point if you think of
 
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
it like a flowchart
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
um we ask who they want to be on the
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
committee and if they want it to just be
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
legislators then great we do I think the
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
standard is three members of the House
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
three members of the Senate
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
um we come up with some duties that they
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
want them to study that's it it goes
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
into session law if it passes both
 
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.730 align:start position:0%
into session law if it passes both
houses

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
houses
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
um the if they want members outside of
 
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:45.500 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
we have to codify it in the rsas and so
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about sort of where's the
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
best place for that to fit who they want
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
on it last year a new rule or a new
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
statute was added that the number of
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
members who are non-legislative members
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
cannot be greater than the number of
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislative members
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
um so several people have gotten around
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
that by saying well notwithstanding that
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
law and then
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know they put as many people as
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
they'd like
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
um but those because those commissions
 
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
tend to be very short-lived you know so
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
again taking the dog grooming as an
 
00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.449 align:start position:0%
again taking the dog grooming as an
example

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
um you know you have your 10 people on
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
the commission and you want them to
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
report back
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't make sense for them to
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
live in the statute sort of forever and
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
ever so we Sunset them or we perspective
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
repeal them usually one to two years out
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
um and that is essentially the
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
difference between the two and how we
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
approach them we always defer to the
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
members on which one
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
um which one they would prefer to have
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
because I know some people have
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
constituents that they want on the
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees some people
 
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.569 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees some people
have

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
um people that they definitely want to
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
give input into the committee we usually
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
do advise them they don't have to be a
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
member to give input but you know again
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
we recognize that every case is
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
different so that is essentially how we
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
handle it Hannah I don't know did I
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so I have the a base form of what a
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
study committee looks like so that would
 
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.630 align:start position:0%
study committee looks like so that would
be

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
I think so a version of a study
 
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.449 align:start position:0%
I think so a version of a study
committee

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so which is going to be a session law
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
not uh codified with an RSA number and
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
so just going through line by line you
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
know they there's a establish a
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
committee to study blank and dog
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
grooming regulations could be one of
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
them and then there's the form three
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
members of the House three members of
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate and as you all know that is
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
massaged frequently especially by the
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
Senate they'll usually bring it down to
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
one member
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and then the duties of the committee
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
is really where the nuts and bolts of us
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
talking to the members of what they want
 
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
do you want them to study what the fees
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
should be what the training should be
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
for dog grooming
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah what other states might be doing
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
any proposed you know if they want to
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
submit proposed legislation and if it is
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
a session law study committee rather
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
than a codified commission those duties
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
is where we would say consult with the
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarians Association of the State
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
uh consult with a member of The Grooming
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
community of the state rather than
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
making them a voting member which is
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
usually what happens in a codified
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
commission and so we've seen many of the
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
same ideas promoted in both ways and
 
00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339 align:start position:0%
it's really just up to the member which
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
Avenue they would like to go with um in
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
in essence they are the same except for
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
the voting members when it comes down to
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
it so yeah we are open to any questions
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you may have said
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.949 align:start position:0%
this but
um

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
are there Sunset requirements
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:09.290 align:start position:0%
on that
um

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
form that they have to go through I mean
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think it is required it's done I
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it's required anything in
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
Statue I can't think of anything off but
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
it does you know when we talk about our
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
job and our duty towards the statutes we
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that what's in the
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
rsas is actually what's current law so
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
if you put a study commission into the
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
rsas and it fulfills its duty but it's
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
still hanging out there it's it's an
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
appendix basically right like it's
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
serving no purpose
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
um so we try as a way to keep the RSA
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
sort of compact readable and
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
understandable by the public if it has
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
served its purpose if they've done their
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
final report then it's time for it to
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
prospectively repeal
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
but there is no requirement that it do
 
00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:02.689 align:start position:0%
but there is no requirement that it do
so

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
and there are sorry there are
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
commissions that have existed in
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
perpetuity like the commission on Native
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
American Affairs is one of them
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
um but there are committees in both the
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate every year that
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
will bring up a number of commissions
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
that they know aren't meeting regularly
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
they are struggling to get membership
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
um that they will ask to Sunset that
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
hadn't had a sunset provision in them so
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
which is why when we meet with members
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
we try to counsel them on do you want
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
this commission to meet for five years
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
do you think the need will be over in
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
five years and put in the prospective
 
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.090 align:start position:0%
five years and put in the prospective
repeal

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
um or do you want it to live in
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
perpetuity or you put in the perspective
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
repeal of five years and then somebody
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
can come in and amend that prospective
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
repeal and extend it after that too so
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
you've seen a number of flavors but
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
there are a number of commissions that
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
have been around for you know 20 plus
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
years that have existed in perpetuity
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you ah
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
yes yes in the XML is it in the packet
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
no because that's it's a it's part of
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
the computer program the software so
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.210 align:start position:0%
it's not
yes

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's not like a PDF form it's it's a
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
different animal
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Abel
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
so there are um a couple of people I
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
think who weren't here at the at the
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
last meeting and so I just wanted to put
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
some context I think into why we were
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
wanting you to come and part of it is
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
that during the drafting process
 
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.050 align:start position:0%
that during the drafting process
um

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
I mean you guys are you you do the
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
drafting but then you know the
 
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
legislature it has to go through the
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
process and then everybody else
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
basically has to live with what's
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
drafted and so I think what we're trying
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
to figure out is
 
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
you know what you have in your templates
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
at this point what sort of things are
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
kind of pain points as they go through
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and then what
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
sorts of things we could work with you
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
on so that we understand what the
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
template is especially for legislators
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
who are coming in so they understand
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be asked when they
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
come in with a great idea and it's not
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
really to get into the the substance of
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
what they once studied although we want
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when they come into
 
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
you they when one of the first questions
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's they're they're asked and maybe
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
you asked this already is has this been
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
studied before have you seen the report
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
and why does this not satisfy you
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
because you know there's really an
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
interest in not developing as many of
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
these as we um as we
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
have been right
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
um but I all anyway that was one thing
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
sure and that's that is an excellent
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
point um but I would say
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
if the new member comes in I'm actually
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
not in a position because I'm hearing it
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
for the first time I don't know if it's
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
been studied before and as far as I know
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
there's not a good easy way to quickly
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
pull that up while a member is sitting
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
um if there was a way that would be a
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
great way to do that
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
well so just give me a follow-up so that
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
but that's part of what we're really
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
working on here
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I you know I think I think there's
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
been a lot of work being done to try to
 
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.029 align:start position:0%
been a lot of work being done to try to
um

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
figure out what commissions exist and
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
have them equally available to everybody
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then just to increasingly make
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
available through research by the member
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
I I mean I think our idea here is that
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's not your as the drafter it's not
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
your responsibility to do the research
 
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
before they walk in the door that's why
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
I would say when they come in they're
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
like okay step one if you want to do
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
this have you talked to OLS do you know
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
that this hasn't been done before
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
because you guys have a million things
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
to do right so that's just also part of
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
our understanding better of the process
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
and what tools we can put into place to
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
make it easier
 
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.750 align:start position:0%
make it easier
um

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
for everybody I mean we did just pass
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
this statute and there is in that
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
statute The Five-Year repeal requirement
 
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.710 align:start position:0%
statute The Five-Year repeal requirement
so

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
I mean part of the thing is I think when
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
people come in they don't necessarily
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
know all the they know what they want to
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
study they don't know all the scoop and
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
I I don't know procedural questions that
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
when when you give the the fine the
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
draft to them they may not have even
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
thought of so we just want to make sure
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
that the draft
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
has as much in it to get rid of the pain
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
points as it as it can anyway we can we
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
can talk about all of that but and the
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I want to say is I
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
think we're really sensitive to the fact
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
that you guys are drafting attorneys
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're not members
 
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.549 align:start position:0%
you're not members
so

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
correctly point out when we're you know
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
that this we have these small Windows
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
when we're accepting your requests and
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're when most of those requests come
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
in via email now uh probably at 80 90 at
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
least uh or via email uh so that
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
requires some back and forth sometimes
 
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
uh which means you have to put it aside
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
while you're waiting for for a response
 
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh which sometimes comes quite later in
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
um and but that's it's a rapid fire
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
period that we're going through and when
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
we receive those requests we want our
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
goal is to turn that around and make it
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
into a true LSR uh that same same day uh
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't carry over that's uh
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can I just clarify and by make
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
it into a true LSR meaning it has a
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
number and a title not that it's
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
completely drafted because we want to
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
make sure it's out there in public so
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
that people are not duplicating effort
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
and then as soon as in the house as soon
 
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
as it becomes an LSR
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
we will batch them and put them on the
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
website so that it helps us internally
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
also because we can look at that list
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
because these seven folks uh are
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
handling various various requests that
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh may not know what's going on in the
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
other in the other cubes in the office
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
 
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
um

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
as representative evil
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
mentioned and we've talked
 
00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:50.059 align:start position:0%
the research
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
that should go into the LSR
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
has it been studied before what was the
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
outcome who who did it when did they do
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
it uh was it done 15 years ago does it
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
need to be done again you know because
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
of times change
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that is
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
frustrating us
 
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.490 align:start position:0%
frustrating us
because

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
the same thing gets punched in over and
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
over and over and it's not your fault
 
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's the system
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we want to
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
our job to do two things kill off the
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
ones that are dead and prevent ones that
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
should be dead
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
so we're we're working right now on
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
preventing bills to be drafted that
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
they did a study five years ago there
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
was an outcome this we don't need this
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it's not your job to say so
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
because your job is to draft new new
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
lsrs and you don't even know if this
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
thing was
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
up in Anne's back closet
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
which which this where all these guys
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
are stored I mean I was up there almost
 
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.930 align:start position:0%
are stored I mean I was up there almost
oh

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
she said if she saw my face it was oh my
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
God I mean it's walls and walls and
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
walls of of bills study commissions
 
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.330 align:start position:0%
walls of of bills study commissions
committees

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
if I may OLS research does very much the
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
same thing and it would be it would be
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
lovely if the members would ask OLS
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
research has this been studied not
 
00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
necessarily by a commission or Committee
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
just by us internally where we have
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
provided it to members and I know
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
frustration has been with house
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee services that members will not
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
will ask because committee services to
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
research the very same same thing that
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
OLS is being has been asked and it ends
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
up being two offices doing exactly the
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
same thing uh which is uh obviously not
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
very efficient way of doing things
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:26.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
keeping your research but you're not
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
here to wait on us here to take what we
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
have and put it into some form of we can
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
work on so thank you very much for that
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I I wonder with all these commissions
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's not
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
argument to study
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
well I've heard of this before I've
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
heard this Ada to mentioned before or
 
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.149 align:start position:0%
heard this Ada to mentioned before or
whatever

00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
isn't that Our obligation to find out
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
through research if I know I mean so if
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
it's a duplicate in the year yes oh I'm
 
00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.210 align:start position:0%
it's a duplicate in the year yes oh I'm
sorry

00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
no it's a parliamentary inquiry yeah
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's a standing joke with us okay
 
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.409 align:start position:0%
that's a standing joke with us okay
great

00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
no so if it's
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
if it's absolutely I'll say actually
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
someone else filed that it's
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative Abel you should go speak
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
with her
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
um if I know that it was done in the
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
past year or so
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
um I will actually mention it because
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'll say oh hey you know they did a
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
commission on that you know did you take
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
a look at it but I have to know about it
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the hard when there's
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
seven of us drafting you know 1200 bills
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
like you don't keep everyone in the
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
front of your brain and especially in
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
the week or two week window that we have
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we're taking requests you're just
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to get things into the
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
system as quickly as you can so
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you know if I know I'm absolutely I'm
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely going to say oh yeah they you
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
know we did something like that last
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
year you know but nine times out of ten
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
I don't remember right in the moment
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
because there's just so much going on
 
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:29.350 align:start position:0%
because there's just so much going on
oh

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
no and can I follow up to that I mean
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'd say one thing if I had a nickel for
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
every time I said have you gone to
 
00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.590 align:start position:0%
every time I said have you gone to
research

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and the person said no my student
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
loans would get paid off after 18 years
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
it is a valuable resource but I think
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
the other thing is and we're not in a
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
position to really say this but if there
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
is especially a very specific question
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
you know encouraging members to just
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
call the department you don't need a
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
study commission to to ask the
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture about why the
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
fee structure for pesticides is the way
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
um you know you really can do that
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
research and any of the research arms
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
are to help you with that but again
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're not in a position where we can
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
really say I can't do this for you you
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
just need to make a phone call so
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
anything that in the orientation in
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
leadership and caucus that you can do to
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
encourage especially new members that
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know hey don't feel be afraid to
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
reach out and ask your questions you'll
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
get a better product if you talk to the
 
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
people yourselves you know I think that
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
that would also be very helpful
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I may representative wall we we do
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
try to tell that orientated orientation
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
in fact Mila's always sitting with me
 
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about research but as
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
you all know that small orientation
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
period for new members who have no
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
experience it's really drinking from a
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
fire hose and it's it's overwhelming uh
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
it's we try not to get too deep in the
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
weeds although you know we can do that
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
believe me uh it and it really needs to
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
be a continuing education form and we
 
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.250 align:start position:0%
be a continuing education form and we
had

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
been looking at doing more than covet
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
hit and we're still kind of recovering
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
from that and of course this year has
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
been a very very busy session uh for us
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh from from the time we started
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
drafting or taking in the requests in
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
the fall it's been non-stop so it is
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
something I will say though that uh
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
it appears that we have more
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
newer members requesting research right
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
now for next year than we've seen in the
 
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:46.730 align:start position:0%
now for next year than we've seen in the
past

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
that's right as Ann points out
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
orientation came after for the new
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
members after the the drafting the
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
filing period for the house this year
 
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.250 align:start position:0%
filing period for the house this year
actually

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
um so I think just in terms of research
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to be working more
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
and more to try to
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
make better the tools for people to go
 
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
online to archived studies themselves
 
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.470 align:start position:0%
online to archived studies themselves
because

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
um and and I think house committee
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
Services has been working on it I mean
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the more we can get that digitized and
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that I think we need
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
to sharpen and look a little more
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
closely on our search tools on the
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
general court website because I have
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
looked I mean I I I'll look for things
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
in every way I can think of and I've
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
been pretty creative and I still won't
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
find something that I know is is there
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
um so I think we really
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
we have to do better with what we have
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
online so that people I mean you the
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
other thing I can imagine is that OLS is
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
inundated with research requests in the
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
two days before is a filing period you
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
know and so but I guess the other thing
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say is I I don't think
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's anybody on the committee that
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
wants to invade your Turf in particular
 
00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:14.059 align:start position:0%
but I think the more we can sort of
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
snuff out the problems that will be that
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
people are going to walk in with to you
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
guys if we can give them a sheet and we
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
can say look you're going to be asked
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
this you're going to be asked this
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to be asked this and you
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
really should be thinking about these
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
things when you're creating these these
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
study committees like who is going to be
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
the appointing authority what about the
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
repeal date what specifically do you
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
want studied I mean one thing we've
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
talked about here already is that some
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
of these commissions they create they
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
put people they put entities on them
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
that the entities don't from their
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
mission they don't want to be on them
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
or they're they're asked like to be on
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 things that they can't possibly
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
do so one thing I would say is have you
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
talked to the people you want to put on
 
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I think the real challenge is to talk
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
people off the threshold of creating
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
these huge commissions and having them
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
fully appreciate that a legislative
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
study committee can do really good work
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
too but the other thing I want to ask
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
you you really don't feel empowered to
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
say to somebody have you spoken to the
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
department or have you spoken to
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
somebody if they come in with these
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
study ideas I absolutely feel empowered
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
but once they say no there's not there's
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
nothing I can really say except okay so
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think that's also I think part of the
 
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
I think that's also I think part of the
challenge

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.610 align:start position:0%
challenge
yeah

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
if I may I understand well the pro the
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
problems here and representative working
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years here and all of
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
your staff whether it be house staff we
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
all I know what's what the problems that
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
these things have uh have caused and you
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
know poor deaf Childs you know I see
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
those I see those appointment emails
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
from her and Sunday morning at five
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning that she's
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
sending out and that's it's that's all
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
it seems she does I know she does an
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
awful lot more but uh those those things
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
are non-stop uh on the appointments uh
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
to to the commissions and committees so
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'm aware and I certainly when we
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
certainly want to be part of the how to
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
make it better I don't know if there's a
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
solution but it's how to make it better
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that some of us
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
been talking about in our in our shop is
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
to at least have some sort of flyer or
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
something that has those sort of
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions and that's and I don't want I
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
don't it's I don't want to go jump into
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
that at this right now other than give
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
it some some thought because I think
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
this committee uh
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
needs to inform whatever that
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
document looks like when we when we have
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
it available for members
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
I think your checklist ideas yeah we
 
00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:02.780 align:start position:0%
I think your checklist ideas yeah we
were

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:02.790 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.350 align:start position:0%
were
[Music]

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.370 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.630 align:start position:0%
um
idea

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
to be part of the proactive how to do
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
this the right way that you don't need
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
commissions is to have for orientation
 
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
to have a check sheet that when you want
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
to have an LSR drafted these are the
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
steps that you should be taking
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
did you do your house research did you
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
do your LSI OLS research
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
has this been a committee commission
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
before when was it a committee it
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
answers the questions
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
before you go to you with an idea have
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
you walked this road before
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
so Jim excuse me representative copault
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
um so so the other challenge I think
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with is that uh
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
committees commissions uh Etc are
 
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
an effective way to gently kill a bell
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
um redirect a bill to you know in a way
 
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
um redirect a bill to you know in a way
that

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt feelings as as badly as
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
just killing it and so I I guess I'm
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
curious first of all to what extent is
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
this a problem with the initial drafting
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
process versus to what extent is this a
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
problem with the amendment process if we
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
have a checklist it needs to be an
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment checklist as well
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
um because I think that's where a lot of
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.730 align:start position:0%
 
ment

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:39.740 align:start position:0%
ment
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
to uh really tackle but our job will be
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
to you know dampen the enthusiasm for
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
creating I I mean I honestly I think the
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions are the ones that
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
are the most
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
difficult for staff for management uh
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know administratively
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
and everything I have less of a problem
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
with the with the study committees just
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
because they're they go fast they
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
automatically Sunset yeah
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
um but I mean I just made a and these
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
are things you guys all talk about like
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that the terms of office for
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
the people appointed are very clearly
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
delineated right
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
um and I know in our statute that we
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
just passed and I just I didn't see that
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
referenced but in your worksheets here
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure that you know it has not
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
that section has not been updated to
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
reflect that but we are keenly aware of
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
um but it's like sometimes a
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
representative might be appointed to
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
something but not in their
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative status and so it's not
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
co-turned you know they're it I mean
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
I've just sat on commissions where
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
people are really confused about their
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
term of office and I think we'll be able
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
to correct that going forward but just
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
going backward
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
um I I mean speaking for myself
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
personally I'd really like to see in the
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
template and then in what comes out for
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
commissions that the House and Senate
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
standing committees that are responsible
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the jurisdiction always will get a
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
copy of the report I mean now we say
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
that the governor and the you know and
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
the clerks and the library get them I
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
think I mean I think the other point of
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
this committee is to make sure that the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
people that need to get these reports
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
are getting them and part of that is the
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
standing committees I mean maybe ledge
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
admin should always get them so that so
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
um have them and then this whole thing
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
about make sure each appointee has an
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
appointee authority we just passed a
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
bill I think last week that there are no
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
appointing authorities for a couple of
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
the people that are in the in the in the
 
00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.569 align:start position:0%
the people that are in the in the in the
bill

00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and then what I just said Can does
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
your entity want
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know and then things that I think
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives have to be sensitive is
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
is is lobbyists really pushing for
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
commissions versus study committees
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's not really your domain
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and then things that I've heard from
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
people is what what do you want in a
 
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
report a lot of these things it just
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
says you have to report by November 1st
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
but it's not like clear what uh
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative thinks should be in the
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
report sometimes people are um are
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
floundering who is the convening
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
authority is it the legislature or is it
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
an agency and the other thing I've heard
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
is people are having agencies convene
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
them because they're they're they wanted
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
to happen but that cost the agency's
 
00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:43.010 align:start position:0%
to happen but that cost the agency's
money

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.970 align:start position:0%
money
um

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
and the other thing for me is that I
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
think that if it's a Senate Bill the
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
Senate has to staff the things and not
 
00:37:52.089 --> 00:37:52.099 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I saw one of your samples here which
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
I liked a lot it said right in there it
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
was a Senate bill and it said a senator
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
shall be the first named member so
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative Abel in our
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
um template you know it actually says
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
that the first meeting shall be called
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
by the first named and if it's a house
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee it is the first named House
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
member if it's a senate committee it is
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
the first named Senate member so I'm not
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
quite sure where this committee or
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
commission is that a department is
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
convening it the only way that that
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
usually happens is if the member
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
themselves asks oh no I want and some
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
they want this this to happen yeah
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted I wanted to clarify
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
like we already that is already part of
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
part and parcel of what we're doing
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's why I know okay great
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
um but the one other thing that I would
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
say is all of this education is great
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
um but we had a portal you know around
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
the time of orientation that had lots of
 
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.710 align:start position:0%
the time of orientation that had lots of
educational

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
um you know videos and documents and
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
things on it I actually pointed several
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
members to it when they would ask
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
questions and that those educational
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
materials are only so good in so far as
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
people are using them and that's where I
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
think it's important again for
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
leadership for the caucuses you know for
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
the older members to really really hit
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
home like you need to use these
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
resources and you know put them out and
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
available as much as possible instead of
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
just relying on orientation to which is
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
drinking out of a fire hose and relying
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
on orientation to say hey here's how you
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
do things okay great have a great
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
session so I don't know we're not in a
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
position to really tell you how to do
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
that but I just do think you know
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
repetition is is key so anything you can
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
do to keep hitting these points with
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
your member of you know here's your
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
checklist because oh he left
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative copal has a great point
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
that there are kind of these life cycles
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
of okay they all come in during filing
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
and then we get crossover and there's
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
definitely a larger number of oh we're I
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
want to try and save my bill or we're
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
going to kill a gently or whatever it is
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
the politics we don't really ask
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
um but there is a large number of
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
conversions right before crossover and
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
then again right before the end of the
 
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.690 align:start position:0%
then again right before the end of the
year

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
um so making sure that that checklist is
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
always kind of floating around in The
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
Ether for members I think would be very
 
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:17.230 align:start position:0%
Ether for members I think would be very
helpful

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um yeah I think so
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
we come up with a checklist it seems
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
like orientation obviously but there are
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
many returning members who are not going
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
to orientation at that point or when we
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
never have under you know it was never
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
communicated to them so it seems like it
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
either needs to be you know I don't know
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
if it'll be the speaker that
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
electronically disseminating it to the
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
whole house or tasking committee chairs
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
with you know
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
when you know you're voting so we're
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
gonna have handing them the form the
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
same way we have to do burbs or for a
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
calendar or anything like that
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
um it seems like something we could
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
try to communicate through some
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
different Avenues yeah because I think
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's right orientation new people are
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
too new to even know what they don't
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
know and then other people are not
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily back in that space well and
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's been exacerbated in that four years
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
ago with covet the system got blown out
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
of the water and then now we're in the
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
second cycle after that where we have
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
new members that haven't seen the place
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
hum the way it used to and uh so that's
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
the the turnover that we have that's
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
over half the members of the house that
 
00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%
have not experienced
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
things running the way they should they
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
should be with the institutional memory
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
that members uh once had and that is we
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
see that as a problem uh in the way
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
members are requesting or dealing with
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
lsrs amendments uh and and the like it's
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
our end of the process we're seeing a
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
lot of that and we have to inform the
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
members of how certain things are
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to work yes
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
maybe representative will kind of answer
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
this but am I correct that if you were
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
to go on to the general court website to
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
do a search the way we do for rsas or as
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
far as we could not just do a search for
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
a keyword first study committee that may
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
have existed at some point you can but
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't work
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
because that seems like obviously the
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
easiest way to weed out for people to do
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
their own piece to this huge yeah
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay representable thank you thank you
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you again
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all pretty much on the
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
same page here
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I think the one step forward we've
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
come to so far today is that we need a
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
brochure or handout of some kind if we
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't actually have continuing education
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
and actually the problem with continuing
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
education as much as I believe in the
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
people who should show up who don't so
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
so if we have a handout of some sort and
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
every single mail slot and reminding
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
people the process to follow what you
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
can do what you should do and what you
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
should not do I think that's the biggest
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
thing we can do it's very difficult to
 
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.910 align:start position:0%
thing we can do it's very difficult to
navigate

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh our website in some instances and a
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
lot of people just give up so if we have
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
a handout you know there's a lot to be
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
said still for paper so I'm with you on
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay representative well I mean I think
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
this is a conversation yes
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I just I I guess the other thing I
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize is that we're also
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
going to be working on something to give
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
to committee chairs with a lot of the
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
same perhaps questions so that you know
 
00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
they go through your process but a lot
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
of the ways that they test the issues
 
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
within the committee as to whether to
 
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
create a study committee or not
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know the Committees will be going
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
through the science saying I mean I I
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
just think this checklist idea where
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's sort of on the same
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
wavelength um on what is going to be
 
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
needed in these things is is um is
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
really helpful and I just you know there
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
is just this thing when speakers when
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
there is a transfer of power things get
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
lost and I think that the more that we
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
could really establish solid policy that
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
exists regardless of who is in the in
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office that this is like
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
the way you do these things it'll all be
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the um to the good and I just I mean
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's great if we can all just keep
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
talking and then you know sort of smooth
 
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
out the process in the long term the
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
goal is to do the best study committees
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
we can get useful information and um but
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
decrease staff and legislative time to
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
the extent possible if I if I I may on
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
that point a great example of that was
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
the what did the RSA 1449 that has the
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
majority legislative members cap and as
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
you all have seen the creative way to
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
get around that is the notwithstanding
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
1449 you do whatever you want
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
um so we've been talking in the office
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
how do we encourage people to follow the
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
statutes that they themselves have
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
passed and house rules is of one place
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
where we can say well in the house rules
 
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:12.260 align:start position:0%
that you agreed to on organization day
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's how we get around duplicate
 
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.130 align:start position:0%
that's how we get around duplicate
filings

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
filings
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
um in the first instance so maybe an
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
Avenue as well as the continuing
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
education and reminding committee chairs
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
is coming up with a house rule about
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees in whatever
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
way you all see fit I mean you've seen
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
it all you've seen the creative ways and
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
maybe different delineations you'd like
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
to make on what's acceptable and not
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
acceptable but rules is another Avenue
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
where we can say no and we don't get to
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
say no very often or at least we get to
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
say no and then they come back and
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're like but I want to do it anyway
 
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
and we we do what you all want to do
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
usually so
 
00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:52.859 align:start position:0%
so rules is a great way for us to say
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
well you all agreed an organization day
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
that this is how you want to proceed and
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
then in order to overturn a rule you
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
need two-thirds majority so
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay I and I do exercise that I have the
 
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
ability in the to say no to duplicative
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
bills or those that are substantially
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
similar and uh I and I I will do that
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
several times during the filing filing
 
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.210 align:start position:0%
several times during the filing filing
period

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
and it takes that takes some doing
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
because I've got to look into the LSR
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
cards and it may have the same title but
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
essentially the same title but it may be
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
two very different things or it may have
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
two different titles and B essentially
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
the same thing so uh it takes it takes
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
some doing to understand that because
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
we're only looking I'm only at that
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
point only looking at what the concept
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
is that the member brought in and these
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
folks will come back to me if
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
if Courtney has two bills that had a
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
different title but they are in fact the
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
same and she'll let me know and I'll
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
look into it and I'll I'll send that
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
communication out saying sorry sorry I
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
can't allow that in and then the member
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
can go to the speaker for uh how is that
 
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.430 align:start position:0%
can go to the speaker for uh how is that
result

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
filings are private but if you see
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
something duplicative then how how does
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I will tell I will tell them
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
I will work if I will work with the
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
first one that came in as as uh being
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
the one that lives uh the second one I
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
will talk to the member and say I can't
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
allow that and I'll cite the house Rule
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
and uh and then it can be appealed to
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
the speaker in the case of the house
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then I will always refer them to the
 
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
house clerk's office for anything else
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
regarding rules
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh anything else on this subject
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else I
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
I force me but anyway
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
I mean the only thing I we about rules I
 
00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
was a really good idea but in any given
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
term you re-adopt the rules
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
but as soon as I mean if we can just get
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
them like so they're standard I mean the
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
other challenge that I think we will
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
have is this obviously isn't a joint
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
committee it's a house committee
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
so you know we'll have to sort of work
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
with the Senate and try to try to um
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
try to work that out
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
who could develop a checklist for us to
 
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
start with
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
us I don't know
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I mean it might be we could get ideas
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
from you and from Anne yeah I mean come
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
up with a checklist and we now have a
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
right a committee clerk who can gather
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
these guys
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.089 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
kind of thing or
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
I mean that would be fantastic and then
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
I mean I
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
the more that's disseminated the better
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
and I think I think you know if if
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
members are leaned on from all different
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
sides hopefully we'll come to a good
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
resolution but you're right I mean the
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
education in the front part it's just
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
I mean in the house we have at least a
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
third turnover
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
ly every term so it's almost like you
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
have so the more standardized we can
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
make this
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
the better and we certainly need to be
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
working this together I don't want to
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
get out ahead of of no this is you're
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
the the center of this whole operation
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
this may inform what you would already
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
be doing if you're drafting a checklist
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
for us but I know you referenced the
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
sort of the computer program that you
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
have to do Fields drop downs whatever it
 
00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.210 align:start position:0%
have to do Fields drop downs whatever it
is

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible or would it be
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
useful for us to get screenshots of
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
those I mean I know you can't print it
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
out for us because it's not document but
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
if we could see what you have to fill
 
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.870 align:start position:0%
if we could see what you have to fill
out

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
does that does that make sense I mean
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
because it would sort of just
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
no when they're drafting uh was saying
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
like he's you know got a programming so
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's why he couldn't print it for the
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
paper but if we could see what what
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
information you have to input yeah I
 
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.069 align:start position:0%
information you have to input yeah I
mean

00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
we can we can print off uh blank I'm
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
gonna yeah yeah it looks like this right
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
the gray fields are where we fill stuff
 
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.410 align:start position:0%
the gray fields are where we fill stuff
in

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
um so I mean we can definitely get you a
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
copy of that I think it'd just be
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
helpful to see what isn't there in a way
 
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
helpful to see what isn't there in a way
right

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
um or help us think about what isn't
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
there so what you see on that the gray
 
00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:42.260 align:start position:0%
again that's the fillable
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the boilerplate that's
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's I mean
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
how we always change it from three
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
Senators to one you know so maybe there
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's available for us to fill that
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
Garden standard RV what are you studying
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
and what are your genes so section one
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
and section three generally
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
you can change everything else but the
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
things that prompt that we're prompting
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
to act
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
s bare minimum what do you want to study
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
really just what do you want to study it
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
set in two different
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
right and it's a forum it tells us what
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
the report is it tells who the reports
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
go to but especially since you wanted to
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
go to the standing committees that would
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
be something but but I think that's
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
exactly what I mean because we're not
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about the
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
substantive matter so much we're going
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
to be looking at the blanks that you
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
fill in So yeah so that we're sort of
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
all on the um on the same wavelength I
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
mean the other thing we should be
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
talking about is you know they come when
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
when are the effective dates of these
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
committees because a lot of times with
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
the commissions they'll say
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
they want to meet in 30 days or they
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
want to mean 45 days and you know
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
honestly that's just kind of
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable if you have a 40 person
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
commission trying to get all your
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
appointments and then they have trouble
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum that is always up to
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor because that is not part of
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
the boilerplate the boilerplate is it's
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage and there's that
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
the first meeting is called by the first
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
named in your case House member
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
um so we will have members who
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
are anxious to get started on studying
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
something who do want it to be 30 days
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
after passage or whatever and again sort
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
of you know we we can't say no that's
 
00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.450 align:start position:0%
of you know we we can't say no that's
crazy

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
crazy
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so we have to we put it in and we may
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
advise and say okay well you know you've
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
got a lot of people here are you sure
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
you want to do that and I mean you know
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
your colleagues they say Damn the
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
Torpedoes and you do what they say so
 
00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
it's a question you ask you don't just
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
like spit out the form and it has 45
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
days in it no there are no days the the
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
format says that the first named in your
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
case House member if it were a senate
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor would be the first name Senate
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
member calls the hearing there's oh with
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it does say first within 45
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
days never mind that's what I thought so
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
because I mean I've seen a lot come out
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
and they say 45 days so I mean a lot of
 
00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
commissions have the governor appointing
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
somebody and you know that can be the
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
longest time lag on Earth and right
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
right so I'm sorry so it is 45 days in
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
there but
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
the first yeah the first meeting is
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
called and I don't know that
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
especially how you do the Quorum it
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean everybody's
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
been appointed yet yeah and that's the
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
problem so one of the things to consider
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
in the timeline
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
to an extent when people want to get
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
going right away on some of these things
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
is that uh it takes a while for bills to
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
get up to the governor's office yeah and
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
a lot and even on on the New Hampshire
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
Public Radio last year I was screaming
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
at the radio in the car when the report
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
said well it's this particular bill has
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
now passed both houses it's on its way
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
to the governor's office and it has to
 
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
sign it by no no because it will be
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
August and exactly I just did this
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
exactly we had at the end of the session
 
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
when we're done on the 29th or whatever
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
it is and all of the bills that have
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
been adopted by both both houses and
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
they come back to us for enrollment it
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
will take us a month
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
to get through those to make sure that
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
they are in correct form we double check
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
everything in every bill before we send
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
send it up for enrollment uh so then it
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
goes and to the Secretary of State's
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
office but then it's still not presented
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
to the governor because there are other
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
steps involved so it's
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're I deal with members of
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
recession saying well why hasn't haven't
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
we heard about that in the governor's
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
office well it has got
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
because there's there's a lot to do
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
between that final day of session and it
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
getting to the governor's office well
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is the the report
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
date I've seen bills come through where
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
they want the report by September and
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm like no you're lucky if you've
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
convened by that November 1st is the
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
default and that is in the 10 th but
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
again we'll have members who come in and
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're like we're going to go
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
so in fact I think I just did one in the
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
past couple days where it was change it
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
to September and it was like okay
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
you know and the Senate has asked in the
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
past that the report did be December and
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
so I mean December doesn't isn't bad but
 
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:41.810 align:start position:0%
September is insane
 
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:47.049 align:start position:0%
September is insane
[Music]

00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:47.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
and also I mean you run into the same
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
issue this year where you might or yeah
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
that you would run into this year if you
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
have a committee that's meeting and
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
their final report is due in November
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
but filing was in September so you've
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
got this odd crossover and so maybe you
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
tack on an amendment to something that
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
exists because you're anticipating the
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
report but then the Senate could there's
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of like date jockeying and
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
half the time it's you know just du jour
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
what does the member choose if they
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
heard from the lobbyist what does the
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
lobbyist one
 
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah and we're we're at the beck and
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
the second part of our Charter is to get
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
rid of obsolete
 
00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
not meeting
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
committees commissions Etc

want or just stay up there it's up to
 
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.230 align:start position:0%
want or just stay up there it's up to
you

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%

um

00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
I was talking to a couple of the members
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
both last week and this week
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
is there a listing of committees and
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
commissions when they meet
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
and when is the last time they met
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
is there a listing anywhere that may be
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
you or maybe that's not a question for
 
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.750 align:start position:0%
you or maybe that's not a question for
us

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I said you can step back if
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
you wanted to
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
compatriot reminded me today that is the
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
primary mission for us to do is to get
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
rid of old archaic useless dead
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
dying committees and commissions that
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything and they're still
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
sitting on the books
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
and like I said and showed me the closet
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
well it's the size of a two bedrooms
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
that where all these things are and
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
obviously are still in effect
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%

entire
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
um time so in any event um yes there is
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
that is what Deborah Childs our Deputy
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh chief of staff is working on and has
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
been working on since the day she walked
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
three years ago is and we have worked
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
out on it with her as well to update
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
this master list what we have done
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
is historically Pam smarling who's be
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
one of our researchers here for over 30
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
years staffed representative Evil's last
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
two committees on commissions as well as
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
the one in 2010. so Pam for all the
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
issues here maintained a master list but
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
then speakers us maintained a list and
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
and other offices did so what Deborah
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
has done
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
um as our deputy chief has and also as
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
the person in charge of making all the
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
speakers appointments to
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
um all these different entities
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
has brought us all together to create a
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
master list that will be maintained with
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
I.T but we're in the process of still
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
developing that and so right now
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
um as you've mentioned you know
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
Deborah's appointments come through at 5
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
00 a.m she is working on a daily basis
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
making appointments to those over 200
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
commissions that exist
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh and and what representative evil had
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
done as we did also in the 2010
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
um committee on committee commissions is
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
to examine all of those correct groups
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
of evil you had a questionnaire that was
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
sent to all of those entities that
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
existed and said when are you meeting
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
what are you doing and you you were able
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
to get rid of a good number 60 something
 
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.789 align:start position:0%
to get rid of a good number 60 something
correct

00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so now we so we are so what
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
Deborah's doing is we're and we're all
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
these different offices are helping her
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
with this the clerk's office house
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
Community Services
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and I.T to combine this finalists for
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
all of you but it is taking time and as
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
you know because we're in the middle
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
session trying to put this all together
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
so we are in the process of doing that
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and I I will
 
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
check with Deborah she's had at least
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
six meetings with I.T to um
 
01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:28.339 align:start position:0%
create this system
 
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
and as we um as you saw when we did our
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
first meeting with all of you and we did
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
the um presentation on all the aspects
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
of what we do she had been coordinating
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
all of that as well
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
so I will check with Debra on the
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
timeline as we can get this at least a
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
draft to you so you can see but
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes she is also in the process in
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
fact I just talked with her this morning
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
that she is contacting some of those
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
groups on her own saying well when is
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
the last time you met because some of
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
these groups have finished their work
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and they don't have a repeal they
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
may want to put in legislation to create
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
a repeal
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
so um we will get that number to you as
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
soon as possible or that list yeah that
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
would be that would be great it gives us
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
something to to start with but because
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
obviously there's committees and
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
commissions that
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
are sitting out there they haven't met
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to meet you know every
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
three months they haven't met in two
 
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
three months they haven't met in two
years

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
we can call them and say are you are you
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to be active are you what are you
 
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
doing you know give us give us give us
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
and we can make a list of those and
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
start start getting these folks in here
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
and say you know this is this is the
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
list well that number may be smaller
 
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
than you think because of all the work
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
that represents of Evil's
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
um group could because the last one was
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
just in
 
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.049 align:start position:0%
just in
20

01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
2021 correct 2020. I mean so just just I
 
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
mean we had every single
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
um agency come in and we reviewed every
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
single statutory commission associated
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
with those agencies and we did it over a
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
period of a year and so we just kind of
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
went through the whole filtering out
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
process so as
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
and said there's probably fewer of them
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
than you might think so last meeting
 
01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
what what we what we sort of agreed was
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
that our first task what we would try to
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
do is
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
um tackle
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
the template idea first because we have
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
another filing period coming up in
 
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
September so to the extent that we could
 
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
help build the tools here
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
um first to try to dampen things down in
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
the future because we just did all the
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
other review work then maybe we could uh
 
01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
we could turn to that
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
just as far as being useful but the
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
other thing is in our statute every that
 
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
we just passed every February 15th and I
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
know it may take a while to get there
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
but ever no every January 15th we're
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
supposed to have the compendium prepared
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
of all the statutory commissions that
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
exist so that that tool is available to
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
everybody and so I know you guys are
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I was just I had talked to a couple
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
of people one of the problems I think is
 
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
figuring out when these commissions are
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
meeting because not all all of them are
 
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
noticed in our calendar a lot of them
 
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
are but I was hoping maybe in working
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
with I.T some of this information would
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
be automatically populated in your
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
compendium so that like Pam and and
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
Deborah didn't always have to be calling
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
to see when they had met last
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
that is part of the plan in creating
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
this as representative evil just
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
referred to it the compendium
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
of where all these groups are meeting
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and as Dave referenced it was much
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
easier before kovid to figure out after
 
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:09.380 align:start position:0%
kova we had a special
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
Senate President and the speaker at the
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
time came up with a special plan that
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
all of the uh commissions needed to be
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
housed by the agencies because our staff
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
was trying to support the standing
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
committees at that time and that did
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
work out and then we haven't transferred
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
back in so we don't have as and as we
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
all know we now have the double rooms so
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have as many meeting spaces as
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
we once had upstairs for these study
 
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
we once had upstairs for these study
commissions

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
and some of the goals when the study
 
01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
commissions are created as you know it's
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
it's to get the agency to start looking
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
at something so it makes sense that the
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
the staff of an agency they are the
 
01:04:52.569 --> 01:04:52.579 align:start position:0%
experts to work with these commissions
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
so that has evolved as well so we so
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's what I always tell people you know
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
we have the pre-covered the covet and
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
the post covet and we're trying to
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
combine all of that together and we're
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
still in this huge learning curve
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
everyone representing people came up
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
remember that day January 15th and how's
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
everything report I just stared at her
 
01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:14.780 align:start position:0%
box I think maybe more like a meltdown
 
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.630 align:start position:0%
box I think maybe more like a meltdown
delicate

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
delicate
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
because we were trying to figure out
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
appointment stuff and I just wondered uh
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's been done I mean the other
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is to throw some
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the people who belong
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
to these commissions and even the
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
agencies to say hey look this thing has
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
run its course I mean and not just keep
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know just realize that
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
you haven't met you know I don't know if
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
I was appointed to something or maybe if
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
people are appointed to something and it
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet for six months maybe flag
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
it to the speaker's office
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
so I think what we can do as soon as we
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
can when um Deborah's going to be
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
meeting with Jennifer and I this week
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
and we're going to look at this and we
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
will get that list if we don't get the
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
entire massive uh flow chart to you we
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
certainly will get those that have not
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
met so you will have that list and if
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
you look in your binder you will see the
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
reports from representative evil and
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the report the
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
questionnaires that were created for
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
these different commissions to say to
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
ask them when have you met what have you
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
done and
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
um that might be something you might
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
want to consider is creating something
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
like that again
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
um for those leftovers that that never
 
01:06:30.359 --> 01:06:31.150 align:start position:0%
um for those leftovers that that never
um

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
uh that we never get an answer from the
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
last uh study and so we will see where
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
that is and also in your binder you will
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
have a list of current
 
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.069 align:start position:0%
have a list of current
um

01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
studies that are being created right now
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the breakdowns according by is
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
listed by committee so um that's
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
something for you to see what we what
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
we're creating right now to add to our
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
list but I wouldn't be surprised if if
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
there may be only
 
01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:02.579 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 minutes 20 might be July maybe
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
10 commissions out there that have not
 
01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
10 commissions out there that have not
met

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
well and I was just going to say what we
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
found when we were going through the
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee on the other committee on
 
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
committee's processes some
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's not always a good test whether they
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
have met or not because some only are
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
convened under very special
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances yeah I mean they're they
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
they perform a specific function so I
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
mean there's all ways of of looking at
 
01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
it so I think we're going to have two
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
like we we want to have a really well or
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
easy to research Archive of existing
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
study committee reports and then an easy
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
to access list of the commissions that
 
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.349 align:start position:0%
to access list of the commissions that
exist

01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
right so we've got two things going on
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
here so and I think what representative
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
evil said is she said the last one took
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
um about a year it is a slow slower
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
process than you than you might think
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
because we want to do this right so
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
instead of creating little lists here
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
and there we're trying to create that
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
master so that we can all have access to
 
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:12.380 align:start position:0%
it and that it's it's integrated within
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
our electronic system so everyone can
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
look so Courtney can just look up oh
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
there were three studies on saus in the
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
last five years and years the fourth I
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
remember one of the biggest ones we had
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
was on um
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
maybe about 15 years ago we had a Civics
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
study House Education
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
um it was a chapters no it was a
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
statutory that was two years long and
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
was an outstanding study because as
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Abel said so a lot of
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
these commissions really they're really
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
worth it yes you have if you have the
 
01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:47.060 align:start position:0%
right combination and the right chair
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
you can do a great job of a study and
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
this this was an outstanding study and
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed worked with it and
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
and all different um schools throughout
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
the state and then after
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
um they were so proud of their product
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
and the report was out and everybody was
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
very happy and then the next filing
 
01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.530 align:start position:0%
very happy and then the next filing
period

01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
two new Civics bills came in and the The
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
Freshman had no idea the study had just
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
um but that also helps when you have
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
as we've mentioned if the chairs get the
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
reports then they can ask if the bill
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
for a study comes before then they can
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
ask the sponsor well are you aware of
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
these studies and that will help but so
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
if we have these
 
01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:31.990 align:start position:0%
if we have these
um

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
the a suggestion for OLS if they have
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
um not guidelines but questions that
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
they can ask the uh sponsors and then if
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
it goes through that level then it would
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
get a standing committee then you can be
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
asked again
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and it's just what I've said before
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
no one all the staff wants to do the
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
work that's what our job is we love our
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
job or we wouldn't be here as long as
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
we've been here and the issue is the
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we're using sometimes
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
commissions can be unwilly as as
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
representable and representative is
 
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.830 align:start position:0%
representable and representative is
mentioned

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.729 align:start position:0%
mentioned
um

01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
often getting the appointments as we
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
know there was a Senate bill that just
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
went through waves and means and and
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
there's no appointing authority or three
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
or four of the appointments to be made
 
01:10:15.239 --> 01:10:16.490 align:start position:0%
or four of the appointments to be made
and

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
how do you it's going to be up to the
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
clerk's office start calling around
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
calling different groups trying to find
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
people who are willing to serve and that
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of Staff time
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
um when if you have these other
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
procedures in place
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
it just would make more sense
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
well and you know
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
Pollyanna or whatever but the real goal
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
here is to produce studies that are used
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
and useful because they can be so good
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
and in many cases they're the generators
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
of really good legislation looking ahead
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
and and you know to do good for our
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
state I mean one of my concerns is that
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
we not like kill off studies that could
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
be generating really really good
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
information you just want to I don't
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
know you just want to fine-tune the
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
process so we we get the information to
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
the people that need it and everybody
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
gets to use the really good stuff that
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
comes out
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and I mean I think that's we can't I
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't want to get so mired in details
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
that we don't lose sight of that
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal yeah
 
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
I think what you just said
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative evil is really key to the
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
whole conversation in terms of
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning because that is what was on
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
um with the it piece also is that a good
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
75 85 I'm not sure you know I don't have
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
an exact figure of the dockets are in
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
there yes you have to be able to find
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
them which could be a challenge but it's
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
really you know that small percentage of
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
um of entities that don't dock it with
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
us that don't schedule in the house
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
calendar that we don't have their
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
information and so it's having that 100
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
complete list that is so challenging so
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of that infrastructure is played
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
in place but it needs to go to the next
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
level and it needs to be 100 complete
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of the pieces but it a
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
lot of it is an exercise and fine-tuning
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
because we want to be at that next
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
100 level well isn't that that saying
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
the last 10 percent it's 90 of the time
 
01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:33.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I'd be happy with 90.
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
but and Jen just reminded me one other
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
item I wanted to mention which we talked
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
about at our first meeting is that these
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
study commissions there's there's no
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
oversight at any level so we had one
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
study commission where the chairman
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
um just asked a member of the audience
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
to write the final report
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
so now the commission members
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
participated and they had no idea that
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
we have designed a template and the
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
process of how things
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
um are how we circulate through funnel
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
reports to all of the named entities
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
within the legislation and uh when
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
thankfully another member was on that
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
commission and came to me let me know
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
about so I reached out to this outside
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
person I found through an agency
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
who was great they sent me something it
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
was a beautiful booklet all in full
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
color but I had to explain to me she
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
really should have the bill number the
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
chapter number the RSA you need all of
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
this reference but it was just um a
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman who was seeing the audience
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
and the chair said would you be willing
 
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
to write the report because he had shown
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
up at every meeting but there's no one
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
to say you you don't we don't have that
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to say this is our
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
process because once they are created as
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
Jen said they have no reason to come
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
back to us for any kind of assistance
 
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.669 align:start position:0%
back to us for any kind of assistance
um

01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
yes but I mean I think that's part of
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
our job too is to sort of put I mean and
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
I think you guys do have something that
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
you give first name members on but
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
really like beef that up and then I mean
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
I think we put the best infrastructure
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
in place that we can and they're going
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
to be people who are far less organized
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
than other people are less experienced
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
and it's not you know that just has to
 
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
be managed on a personality by
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
personality basis but for the most part
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
you should have you know we should try
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
to have the infrastructure in place so
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
that you can do your jobs
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes and this is the first time with the
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
creation of this committee this is the
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
first time that we have this overall
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
look at the entire process Beyond just
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the legislation excuse me at
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
the study committees that need to be
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
examined or commissions to see if
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're meeting this is again the whole
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
process and bring all offices together
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
and that's really important and I think
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
that um this this is one of the most
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
important pieces that you will be
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
working on because it'll affect all of
 
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.850 align:start position:0%
working on because it'll affect all of
us

01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
um for a long time
 
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
um for a long time
yes

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
just an observation from my viewpoint I
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
was on a commission it was it was a good
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission the uh alcohol tourism
 
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.209 align:start position:0%
commission the uh alcohol tourism
Commission

01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
and we had great meetings we had great
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
people everybody from all the alcohol
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
Industries including the Liquor
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
Commission and uh
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
three people from
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
Commerce at a senator
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
and we had meetings and it was November
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
election time
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the chair of the commission did not
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
get reelected
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
document written at the end he just said
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
too bad
 
01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
he he actually he he was told he could
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
not do anything he said you no longer
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
exist and that's we all we were all
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
there we saw it happen but there was no
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
line of succession to write the report
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's very fortunate that everybody
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
in the alcohol industry took the ideas
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
that we had that were going to be in the
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
final report and these bills have come
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
through the house through the Commerce
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
Committee since then and 95 percent of
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
our ideas are now in the law but there
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
was no final report ever written and
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
that drove me up the wall and my
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
Democratic counterpart on it drove us
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
both up the wall because there wasn't in
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
everybody's going where's the where's
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
the where's the report where's the
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman never wrote the report
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
well that does happen representative
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
petusic when you have when you cross
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
over that's why that November 1 deadline
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
has always been suggested because if you
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
moved past an election
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're no longer here or if you missed
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
that deadline
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
it no longer exists and we've had
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
members or you don't get a quorum by
 
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
then representative McConkey spent a
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
year and a half trying to get a quorum
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
and he never he never did did he put it
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
on there Doc Bill and he just kept
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
calling and calling and he was just
 
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
he could not meet and then we've had
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
what we do is we do when the members
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
cannot get a quorum and they're past the
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
deadline for their report we have a
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
letter that they just write a letter I
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
never was able to get a quorum
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
um or for whatever reason and this is my
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
final report there is no report
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Ian
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to interrupt I was just going
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
to say that's another good question
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
though for people that want to do these
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
things what do you plan to use with the
 
01:17:59.219 --> 01:18:00.649 align:start position:0%
things what do you plan to use with the
result

01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
what what is your ultimate goal with do
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
you plan to introduce legislation I mean
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
why are you
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
doing I mean it seems obvious in a way
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
but you know that might
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
yeah well and then the Committees will
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
have a huge role in sort of vetting all
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
these things too but
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
good okay thank you everyone
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think we definitely dug Into the
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
Depths where we needed to dig and we got
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
some information and we're basically
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
waiting with beaded breath for that
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
compendium of committees and commissions
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
so is there any other business to come
 
01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:46.820 align:start position:0%
before this
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
I have a question actually before thank
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
you so much for representative wall and
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
represent well could you just like
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
update us on this um is it Senate Bill
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
84 which is on the commissions yes so um
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
the plan of uh ledge admin on SB 84 is
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to retain that and uh
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
we created a subcommittee
 
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee will take what we do
 
01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee will take what we do
here

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
and put it in SB 84.
 
01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.709 align:start position:0%
and put it in SB 84.
excellent

01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
I fully agree with what was just said
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
um we need to get moving on getting
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
something done uh we've been given a
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
load of information even today
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
we already have some concept of
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
legislation we'll be needing to file in
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
terms of the bills that commissions
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
rather and committees that have been set
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
up if we can get a list of what's
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
functioning what's not we need to get
 
01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
right down to work on figuring where we
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
can go with that we have a whole host of
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
things we need to be working on so I
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
think we need to single out what we're
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
going to do first
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
and move forward on that I would like
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
very much for us to get that list of uh
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
if we can as soon as possible as to
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
which commissions are meeting and which
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
ones are not
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
and see where we can go with that what
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
do you think I think right I agree I
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
mean I think that's good I'd still say
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
that I think the thing that we really
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
really need to do is figure out um our
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
policies for people that are going to be
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
trying to form these things in September
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
we have two yeah and they really do go
 
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.970 align:start position:0%
we have two yeah and they really do go
together

01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
but we're being proactive on one and
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
reactive on the other and right now uh I
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
just have one other question I and I
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't even know if this is possible
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
but to put in the bill SB 84 is there
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
something that we could say if a
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee or commission hasn't filed a
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
report in the last three years or met in
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
the last three beers they're going to
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
automatically be repealed
 
01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:01.460 align:start position:0%
yes yes we can
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure we could
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting a lot of yeah from senior
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
staff here saying yes we can do that and
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
that would be an excellent idea I mean
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is that if
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
you I mean I know there are many
 
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.149 align:start position:0%
you I mean I know there are many
commissions

01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
um they have a repeal date built in so
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
well I mean they might yeah the new ones
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
going forward after yeah last 12 1296
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
was it yeah so they should they'd have a
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
five-year repeal date I mean it kind of
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
depends on what they haven't but for the
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
other ones
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
I get I you know depending on what their
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are I mean that's like
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
you said that there's some that have to
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
stay in because they meet periodically
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
so they won't they're not going to have
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
I mean there are commissions that review
 
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.450 align:start position:0%
I mean there are commissions that review
issues

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
that are less study and more oversight
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
do you know what I mean so they don't
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue reports as part of their
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
charge but if they are supposed to issue
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
reports as part of their charge and they
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
haven't then
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
because they're obviously not doing
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
their jobs right I mean it's another way
 
01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
their jobs right I mean it's another way
okay

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
we're just going to do that just want to
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
offer this up peripherally something we
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
probably don't talk enough about and
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to writing legislation
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
or having an issue we need to do a
 
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
better job no matter what side of the
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
aisle no matter what side of the wall or
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
on the cultural component and
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative Cole fault spoke to it
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
about not hurting somebody's feelings
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
about keeping their bill alive we need
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
to message this correctly we we can't be
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
spending every six years putting
 
01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
together a committee like this
 
01:22:57.169 --> 01:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
to address commissions and committees
 
01:22:59.209 --> 01:22:59.219 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't have necessarily been
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
into some great like was spoken about
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
but we need to do a better job job
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
collectively and globally in the State
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
House of uh looking at this and
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
making the decisions not to just
 
01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:14.570 align:start position:0%
making the decisions not to just
perpetuate

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
perpetuate
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
what could be uh legislation gets killed
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
off let's just
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
direction from community
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
I think it's you know I know that's the
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
messaging of that I guess probably had
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
its own challenges but I I think
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen's point about
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
building in the repeal date seems like
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
the most straightforward best way we
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
could weed out a lot I mean that would
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
just be a default then if you could put
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
in a carve out for some sort of appeal
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
process or committees that for whatever
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
reason aren't meeting but there's a
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
purpose for them to you know that they
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
can justify continue to exist but it
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
would it would they would just go away
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
under that sort of legislation right
 
01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:03.790 align:start position:0%
under that sort of legislation right
otherwise

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.490 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:06.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
speaking briefly to that
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see that the set in law
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
contingent repeals or saying that these
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
things were repealed if they haven't met
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's essentially a contingent repeal
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
are very difficult for us to deal with
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
on the end when it comes to revising the
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
code now we don't do that our publisher
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
does that but we will get questions from
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
the publisher we've got probably 20
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
Pages this year what about this not
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
commission necessarily but some other
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
program that was contingently repealed
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
or Sunset and we can't necessarily
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
answer unless we do some additional
 
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.890 align:start position:0%
answer unless we do some additional
research

01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
many programs are also
 
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.229 align:start position:0%
many programs are also
uh

01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
prospectively Sunset unless
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
a commissioner certifies that XYZ has
 
01:24:54.179 --> 01:24:55.130 align:start position:0%
a commissioner certifies that XYZ has
done

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
we've and usually that certificate in
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
the law it says that I'm supposed to get
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
copy of that certification but very
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
frequently do not I can tell you in the
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
past six years I've probably gotten two
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
letters of certification regarding
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
something like that when every session
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
we have that language put into a bill so
 
01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:13.820 align:start position:0%
those sort of things that
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
contingent have contingencies are very
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
difficult on the back end
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
making sure that the code is updated
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
correctly because we do not in our
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
office get that information
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
so I would advocate for something in the
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself in the law itself
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
having that repeal uh would be much more
 
01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.870 align:start position:0%
having that repeal uh would be much more
preferable

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
preferable
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay um yes and I I
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
think it's really imperative that every
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
chairman of every committee and every
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
ranking member of every committee
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
um get ready to instruct our fellow
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee members uh what should and
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done prior to filing
 
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
because it's coming up in September
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
right even if we don't have that little
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
brochure or whatever we're looking for
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
the handout we should all be on the same
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
page in terms of what can be filed what
 
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
should be filed if we're having a
 
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
commission or a committee yeah we should
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
stay have a stated purpose a really
 
01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:14.900 align:start position:0%
definite purpose for why they're meeting
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
be very careful who we have appointed to
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
the commission or committee I still
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to drag people and from the
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
Departments and agencies except to come
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
and give information not to be members
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
of those commissions and such
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
um I have a sunset provision if need be
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
but give them a specific framework in
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
which to work and I think that our
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
members will appreciate being
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
enlightened and updated on whatever
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
information we can give them prior to
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
filing for next year thank you
 
01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and then the other thing is to do
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
what ledge admin is doing I mean
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee standing committees are
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
empowered to do ad hoc
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
studies of things it doesn't always have
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
to be a study committee I mean it's hard
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
because everybody's busy but you don't
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
if if a committee really wants to study
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
something maybe one of the things the
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
chair asks right off the bat is shall we
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
study it ourselves because nine times
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
out of ten if it's on a certain subject
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
area a lot of the Reps who are assigned
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
to a study committee are going to come
 
01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:21.860 align:start position:0%
from the particular committee anyway
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
like a landfill committee or something
 
01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:28.340 align:start position:0%
it'll come from Ena just to pick a name
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I agree that yeah we have the
 
01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.850 align:start position:0%
and I agree that yeah we have the
different

01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:33.860 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
and we have subcommittees and we charge
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
like the insurance department to do this
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
don't set up a subgroup we charge them
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
to do this and come back and talk to us
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
done and and different committees have
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
different cultures yeah right so that's
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
how they should take lessons from John
 
01:27:51.719 --> 01:27:52.910 align:start position:0%
how they should take lessons from John
yeah

01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
jerem I agree in our paperwork it says
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
Legend men for example
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
um Ken setup and I caught committee or
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
two or three or whatever is necessary
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's a small committee though
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
um for studying certain things but
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's a limit as to what you can ask
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
members to do as well so it all keeps
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
going back to the original filing the
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
purposes the restrictions if you might
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
say are the guidance on what these
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees need and get
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
on with it you know set deadlines just
 
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
do this and what you can't do we can we
 
01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.310 align:start position:0%
do this and what you can't do we can we
can

01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
resubmit to continue that process but at
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
the same time if they know that there's
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
a timeline in which to get something
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
done I think people often really try
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
very hard to accomplish that thank you
 
01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
very hard to accomplish that thank you
okay

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody it's been a great
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
meeting I think we got some ideas to go
 
01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:52.699 align:start position:0%
forward and we'll see you in one week at
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
