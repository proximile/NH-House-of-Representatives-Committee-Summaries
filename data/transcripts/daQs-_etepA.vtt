it includes the staff though represent
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
1659 this
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
is a work session it is
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
not a hearing we will not be taking
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
from anyone um the committee has
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh received in the past
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
a correspondence email correspondence
 
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.269 align:start position:0%
a correspondence email correspondence
from

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
a number of um
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
members of the public uh on this bill
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
and um as i know how conscientious you
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
all are
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
i assume you have read all of that
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh so um having opened up the work
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
session on
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
house bills 16 59
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
i remind of the committee
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
that because this was an
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
interim study bill there are only two
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
things we can do the bill
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
in fact dies when
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
this session dies
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
so the bill itself
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
does not get referred to the next
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
legislative session it is my hope that
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
every one of you
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
will be part of the next legislative
 
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.749 align:start position:0%
will be part of the next legislative
session

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and will bring your knowledge back
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i know some of us are in a
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
actually three of the members of this
 
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.430 align:start position:0%
actually three of the members of this
committee

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%

in durham um are part of a primary
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
because there's six
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
general election fight
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
i'm counting on you all coming back
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
because we were a very good committee
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
um but all we can do is we can
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
recommend the legislation
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
for further consideration or
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
not recommend the legislation
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
for further consideration understanding
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
that it would not be
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
this bill um a new bill
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be filed um
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
and i think the freshmen have not uh
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
have not had that experience and so i
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're clear that it's not that we're
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
saying this bill
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
if we vote to recommend that we're not
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
saying that this is the bill
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
that would um appear um
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
in the next session it will not um
 
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i would now open um
 
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
and i would now open um
[Music]

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
the discussion to um anyone
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%

in with her quickly
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
um i think she's connected by audio only
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay so um representative walper would
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%

technical
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
technical problems none of the rest of
 
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
technical problems none of the rest of
us

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay now um i'd like to open up
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
the discussion oh i guess there's one
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
other thing i should say
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that is that um
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
i had asked representative chase
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
to head uh a subcommittee
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill when we were still in the
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
real world
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
and uh but of course she could not
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
start that work until we entered the
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
unreal world that we're in now
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
nonetheless at my suggestion
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
not knowing what would happen so that
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
she would be prepared i asked her
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
um to make sure people
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
knew that you know she was interested in
 
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
knew that you know she was interested in
forming

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
forming
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee several people did
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to her
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that she should do the research that
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
any chair of a subcommittee should do
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
so that she would be ready to lead that
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and she has done that
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
research and at
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
whatever time i mean either now or later
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
um recognize her and i don't think i've
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
forgotten anything else
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
but if i have you'll remind me i'm sure
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
so now um representative stevens do you
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to say something
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
or not i you'll no i wanna okay
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
your lights going on and i just didn't
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
know um
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
okay okay um and uh
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing let's see i go
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
to participants
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i see representative woodbury has
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
his hand raised is that
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
because you would like to speak uh yes
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you very much it is i
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
just have a uh
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
question and i want to check my memory
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
because of course we went through this
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
in detail
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that in the states
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
that legislation like this has already
 
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.029 align:start position:0%
that legislation like this has already
passed

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
it is not is not commonly used
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i know people have kept statistics
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
on how
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
how many people use uh
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
this this method of ending their lives
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
but i don't really know
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
whether to say it's it's there but not
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
used it's there but it's wildly popular
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
or somewhere in between i i'm hoping
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
somebody can
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
straighten me out um
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative chase would you like to
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
answer that or would you like me to
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
um no i i can answer and then you can
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
jump in
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
if you'd like thank you very much madam
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
woodbury for that question
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
there is um quite a bit of data from
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
the states that do have the end of life
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
bill and they put it out every
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
probably year or every two years
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
i do have that information if it's
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
something that the committee
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
would like to see it breaks categories
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
down as to age it breaks down as to
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
disease or diagnosis how many people
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
actually use the medication how many did
 
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
actually use the medication how many did
not

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
how many ended up with a natural death
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
versus how many
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
um did decide to to help
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
their own end so it's very informative
 
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.110 align:start position:0%
their own end so it's very informative
very

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
thorough i've reached out to most of the
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
states that do have a end of life bill
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
and again finding due to covert i didn't
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
get a lot of
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
response but the ones that i did like
 
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
response but the ones that i did like
california

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
california
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
just apologize for being understaffed
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
i've set up
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
um a talk with the ethics committee
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
from the state of virginia i am sorry
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
of vermont which i'm looking forward to
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
because they'll have a lot more
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
information so i would like to also
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
put out there that if there are other
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
questions like this from the committee
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
and you'd like to pass them on to me
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
while i am doing the rest of my research
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'd be more than happy to to answer
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
a list of questions versus you know just
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do it right now because
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
it's extremely complex and in depth
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
does that answer if i could just add to
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
that are you finished
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
yes if i could just add to that
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
um a number of states have been at this
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
a number of states have been at this for
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
a short period of time
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
and obviously the longer the experience
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
um the more instructive uh
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
is is the the results what
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
has seems to have been consistent
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
and actually much to my surprise
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
particularly i believe in oregon and
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
in washington is that
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
the alternative and this is one piece of
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
a continuum
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
and the alternative that really
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
frightens or disturbs
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
um many of us of
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
um of actually having um
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
an assistance in ending one's life
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
has been used
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
relatively rarely not just in terms of
 
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:17.990 align:start position:0%
relatively rarely not just in terms of
the

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
general public but in terms of those
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
very people
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
who have asked
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
for uh permission
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
to end their lives
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
so from that just that pool of the
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
initiated um action
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
um the percentage is is very small i
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have the numbers in front of me
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and i don't want to misquote so i'm
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
just saying very small
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
what has been interesting is that
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
so many of those patients are in hospice
 
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.909 align:start position:0%
so many of those patients are in hospice
care

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
and the hospice professionals report
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
um in what they believe is a
 
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
um in what they believe is a
statistically

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
statistically
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
significant survey that
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
those of the pool in hospice
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
some of those people have requested
 
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
some of those people have requested
permission

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
um for assisted uh end of the
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
end of life and some haven't the ones
 
00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
end of life and some haven't the ones
who

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
have have ended up
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
with less depression
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
more emotional stability more
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
ability to relate to other people and a
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
whole list of things
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
because the professionals say and i
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is true
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
that they they have some comfort from
 
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.710 align:start position:0%
that they they have some comfort from
knowing

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
at some point if they can't
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
handle it anymore they do have an
 
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.789 align:start position:0%
handle it anymore they do have an
alternative

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
and that alone has
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
made their end of life
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
more peaceful and
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
made them better able for example to
 
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.310 align:start position:0%
made them better able for example to
maintain

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
communication with their family and
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
loved ones
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would not have expected that and i
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
found that to be very interesting
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
um the one other thing that i would like
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that there are so many
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
of people who say what if
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
um or is this going to
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
be is anyone going to be forced into
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
this or is there going to be community
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
pressure is there going to be financial
 
00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:52.149 align:start position:0%
pressure is there going to be financial
pressure

00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
from families um uh
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
and uh you know
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that has become
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
most clear to me
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
we need to do in this state
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more research and a lot
 
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.110 align:start position:0%
a lot more research and a lot
more

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation of how
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislation could be structured
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
what the intentions of any future
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislation would be
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think we're there yet but
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know representative hargan i see
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
your hand is raised
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
yes i was um i was just going to
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
refer back to the fact that um we had um
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
we had a very long
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
amendment which completely replaced the
 
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.870 align:start position:0%
amendment which completely replaced the
bill

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
which was submitted after the uh after
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
the public hearing so um
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
so just uh some until we don't have to
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
send this exact bill we actually have
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
two different versions of the exact bill
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
the second one um the second one we
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to the decision was in
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
fact uh representative burch's majority
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh report
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
refers to the fact that like they
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
weren't sure that we had that the bills
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
these prime sponsors submitted a
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
completely revised bill and
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
we couldn't we felt like we didn't deal
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
with in the time allotted to us um
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
i mean i myself was actually the
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
minority and voted
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
no in the interim study but um
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
so we do have those two different
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
amendments and i'm not sure if anybody
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
wants to speak to like what the
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
difference between the two was
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not the right person to speak
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
but the difference in the two was
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
was supposed to put both of them
 
00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:49.990 align:start position:0%
was supposed to put both of them
personally

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you madam
 
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.269 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you madam
chair

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
um to answer or to
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
enlighten on your question
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes there were two amendments the
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
original bill that had been put in
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
by representatives sandler i
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
she did voice that she wasn't really 100
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know sure about
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
the language in it and it wasn't exactly
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
what she wanted so she did hand us a
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
amendment on march 4th of what
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
it wasn't an approved amendment at that
 
00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:23.669 align:start position:0%
it wasn't an approved amendment at that
point

00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
um with a little bit more
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
of what she wanted in that bill there
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
were still when i found
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we did as we talked to people at
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
that open hearing
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
there were still a lot of questions and
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
it really the language isn't exactly
 
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.590 align:start position:0%
it really the language isn't exactly
what

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
um people are asking for or wanting to
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
have some answers put into it
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
so as far as what the difference is i'm
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
not 100
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
sure what it is but i know that the
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
not in agreement with the original one
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
that had come out to us
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
and did put in her second one
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
um that's all i really have on
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
that um if i could
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
ask um our committee
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
researcher needless to say i don't have
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
access to the files
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
um as i recall and i hope somebody will
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
that amendment that came in did not come
 
00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.149 align:start position:0%
that amendment that came in did not come
in

00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
um through legislative services and
 
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
um through legislative services and
therefore

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
um representative hargan um it was
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that your recollection also
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
because in that case you know we've
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
never had
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's next proposal
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the file representative
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%

00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%

um representative chase thank you madam
chair

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the um the february 20th
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
amendment which is 0.706h
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether we have it or not there isn't a
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
part in here that i found to be
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
we we have let me back up we know
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opposition
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
from our disability community and
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
mental health just feeling that
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
there could be some coercion into
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
the end of life and not really fully
 
00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
the end of life and not really fully
understanding

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
what i feel fully understanding exactly
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
what the language of the
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill is versus what could happen
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
later um so there is a part in that when
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
people when we do get it and
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
i it's on page three and it is
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 line 15. it says no
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
person shall be qualified no person
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
shall be a qualified patient
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
under this chapter solely because of age
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
or disability
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
and three no person or agency including
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
a legal guardian or
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
agent under the durability durable
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
health care power of attorney shall be
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
authorized to make a request for
 
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.630 align:start position:0%
authorized to make a request for
medication

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
medication
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter on behalf of a
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
patient who is not
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
capable so i find that that clause
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's been put in or those lines
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
does help really put that together
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
no you this people have to be capable
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
of making this decision themselves so
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully taking out a little bit more
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the um the
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
fear of the coercion and um that
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
a legal guardian or another agent a
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
durable help cannot just
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
say i think it's time that's is
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
up to the patient and there has to be
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
all of the other rules followed that i
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't need to get into here
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
in order to even qualify so i really
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
liked that part of the bill
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's some nice language that's
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
been put in
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
that um if another legislation if we
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
bring this
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
forth we should uh keep or even add to
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
if we'd like to but i wanted to bring
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
that up because i find that to be very
 
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.950 align:start position:0%
that up because i find that to be very
important

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
with some of the issues that were
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
brought forth to us
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative birch i noticed
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
that you've given up on them
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
wisteria and you now have a fall
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
background but i still recognize you
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you um not sure if that's
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
spring or fall
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
but i i just wanted to clarify
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
in my own mind that ultimately we're not
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much we're going to
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
discuss the specifics line by line
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
of either the original bill or the two
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
suggested amendments
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
versus what our chair said earlier
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
all we're going to do is recommend that
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
this matter be further studied or
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
not further studied and i don't think we
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to go
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the details
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
but my recollection is that neither
 
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
but my recollection is that neither
amendment

00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
has been formally uh put on the table
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
by uh by anybody on the committee
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and looking at the docket i don't see
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
march amendment was
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
moved in any way or put on the table i
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that was other people's
 
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.230 align:start position:0%
make sure that was other people's
understanding

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
that is how i i
 
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0%
that is how i i
remember

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
am i missing something
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
make sure i do now representative welper
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
can someone help to understand i got it
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay there you go
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
good i forgot all right so i have to
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
second what representative byrd said
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
our task here today is not to get into
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
the weeds of the
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill itself and the value of that
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
or the
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
problems with it it's to decide whether
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
or not we
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
should recommend future legislation
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
so this basically is a yes or no
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
question i personally believe that
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
there is no acceptable way this bill can
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
be written and so we should not
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
clearly there and there's a significant
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion on that on the
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee but that's my view is no
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
we're not going to find a way of doing
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
this i don't know of any law in the
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the world that exists that allows
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
this that would be acceptable to
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
a very large cohort in our society
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
but i think that's where the discussion
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
should should focus
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your wise
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
comments um representative woodbury
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i intend to
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of passing this along for
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
future consideration but i do it
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh simply because i find it
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
not compatible with the way i look at
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
the world to shut off
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate inquiry into any subject
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
but i have some severe reservations with
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat somewhat but not completely
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
echo those of representative wolfer
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's clear that this is a
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is a topic and a subject that has
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
has received a strong
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
strong condemnation from a large segment
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the society
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
and we saw that when we had a hearing in
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
rep's hall
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
last winter and we continue to see it in
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the emails that we're getting i'm
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
interested to see that
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
we don't get very many emails from
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
proponents of this
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
we get a few but not very many and
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago you confirmed what i
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
thought was true representative smith or
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
that this isn't terribly popular in the
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore i when it comes time to
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
consider some bill in the future
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
i have real questions about whether it
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense to
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
move forward on something that is so so
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
strongly disliked by a pretty decent
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
segment of the of the of our population
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
and not very popular where it's uh
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
where it's in force so i'm going to go
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
ahead with this
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
but that's not a suggestion that i would
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
favor a future bill on the subject i
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
just i'd have to take a look at it as it
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
okay um and i don't see
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
following the the guidance of
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative welper and representative
 
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
representative welper and representative
burch

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
burch
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
pro is not the time to say we like
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through 16 but we don't like
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
lines 32 through 34 and it's just
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
the the question is this something where
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
we uh we recommend for further
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
legislation or not um i
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
would like before we end the discussion
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
to recognize representative chase
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
who has done research on behalf of the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee to see if um
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
if she has anything that she would like
 
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
if she has anything that she would like
to

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
share with us about that research
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
and then from that point on we can
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
close the workshop and open up the
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you madam
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you everyone and i
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
i want to apologize for i wasn't
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
actually trying to go line by line it
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
was just something i found
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
in my research that looked like it had
 
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.150 align:start position:0%
in my research that looked like it had
been

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
thought about so um yeah i did
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
try to do as much as i could
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
with coveton not being able to have a
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
i just i found out that end of life
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill of some type of legislation has
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
been submitted 15 times
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
between 1992 and 2020.
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
three of the bills were introduced by
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
the senate and 12 of them by the house
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
they all weren't
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
the same they've been tweaked they've
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
come in in different ways but it's
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
something that's that that is like
 
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
something that's that that is like
interest

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the residents of new hampshire
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
whether it be
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
for or against whether you have an issue
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important and one way or
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
another and i really
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
want to say that i find
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
this needs con further consideration
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else i had done yeah
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know the same i have confirmed that
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
there is a quite a lot of fear
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
and misunderstanding of the actual
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
language of the
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill or the legislation versus personal
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
beliefs and interpretation of what
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
the bills that have been brought forth
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
are trying to accomplish
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
it does create legitimate questions that
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
definitely need to be addressed and
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
required further study
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
but i do believe in merit that this
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
does require further consideration and
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
additional work must be done
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
to improve the bill and the language
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
before that any
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is brought forth i also just
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
want to throw in there that
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
um in over this time there has been a
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
grassroots organization that has been
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
formed to try to help or to help educate
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
the public about the complexities if not
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation but by the broader
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
end of life issues
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
so this is something that i think is
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to be very important it's going to
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh the intention is to dive deeply into
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
the points
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
brought forth by both the supporters and
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
the opposition
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
including as i said the fear and the
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
unknown and the unattended inaccurate
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
readings and information regarding
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
definitions such as qualification
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
requesting for disposal of medications
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
just to name a few
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
clearly there are a lot a lot of
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions out there and by going through
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
other um states that again as
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
as representative or chairwoman smith
 
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:04.950 align:start position:0%
as representative or chairwoman smith
said

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
some of them have been for quite a while
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
starting with oregon who's been almost
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
20 years now
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
with their law and then we have two
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
states who just
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
passed their law last year which happens
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
to be our neighbor one
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
of uh maine so they're still uh
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's kind of all over the place as far
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
as the information that we're looking
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
for and to really dive in
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
but i do feel that the more we talk and
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
the more we look at this
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
and who use the medication who didn't
 
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.069 align:start position:0%
and who use the medication who didn't
just

00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
being able to be comfort knowing that
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
you have the choice to make in this
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
decision um again i just
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
find it it merits more
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
more further consideration
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
for possible future legislation
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question goes to
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative chase a bit i've read
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
carefully the emails and letters and
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
i've also gotten phone calls
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure most are all of us have and
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
they've been you know thoughtful
 
00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:27.349 align:start position:0%
they've been you know thoughtful
citizens

00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about this legislation but
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
what i've heard a lot of
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
is less about the particulars
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
of what this legislation is attempting
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
to cover and not cover
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
and more the the slippery slope of
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
well if we do a then b
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
and c which are really terrible are
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if as you did your
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if as you did your
research

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
whether first of all this kind of
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
slippery slope tended to occur
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
in other places that you've looked at
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
in other words how realistic a concern
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that if we spend a lot of time let's
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
say coming up with
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
very specific legislation and people are
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
not what's in it but what might be in it
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
two years from now or ten years from now
 
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.750 align:start position:0%
two years from now or ten years from now
right

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative chase answer that
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
um yes that's a huge concern
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
and it has not happened
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
in any of the states that i have talked
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
with or have researched on
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
but it is a concern that's why they've
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
also have ethics committees put together
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
to go over these things
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
that is part of the the um information
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
that i was saying that
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
is not it's the difference between fears
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
and misreading of the actual bill
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
to what the bill is about the bill is
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is written right now and
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that's been through and even
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
based on oregon which these are you know
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
gives it
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
you have to have a diagnosis and a
 
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.349 align:start position:0%
you have to have a diagnosis and a
six-month

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
six-month
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh window of life let's put it that way
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
so i think a lot of the fear what i was
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
finding when i talked to different
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and i have talked to both
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
pros and cons
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
and talking and looking at the research
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
from other states is the fact that
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of the fears coming from the
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
netherlands and from other
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
countries which do have euthanasia laws
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
that um they're creepy to tell you the
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
truth they are i mean the netherlands
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
no belgium actually has one for
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
terminally ill children
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
at this point so i understand the fear
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
what um that in the slippery slope
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know i think we can put that with
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
almost any bill you start something as
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
well what about this what about that
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
their oregon actually is the first
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
state who has put in their it's their
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
first amendment
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's been put in because the
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
disability community
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
was feeling that again they were being
 
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:13.109 align:start position:0%
was feeling that again they were being
discriminated

00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
discriminated
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
some people because they weren't able to
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
administer the medication themselves
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
so that has now changed and there's been
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
amendment put in for that bill
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
yes it's a fear yes i did not really see
 
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.150 align:start position:0%
yes it's a fear yes i did not really see
where

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's made any difference in the bills of
 
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.910 align:start position:0%
it's made any difference in the bills of
the

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
or the laws of the states that have this
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
right now but i'm
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
also still working on that this is a
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
work in progress like i said i'm going
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
to be talking with the
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
vermont uh director of the ethics
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
committee and these are questions i want
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
to put out there when i get that
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
information i would love to share it
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
that answer thank you
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you now let's see i think
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair good morning
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh so first of all i want to start with
 
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
uh so first of all i want to start with
a

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
an objection to all of these zoom type
 
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.349 align:start position:0%
an objection to all of these zoom type
meetings

00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
as far as uh our constitution part first
 
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
as far as uh our constitution part first
uh

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
article 8 is concerned i i do not find
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
this to be
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
a process that is open and transparent
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
for the citizens contemporaneously
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
being a a
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
an actual at the same time kind of
 
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.750 align:start position:0%
an actual at the same time kind of
meeting

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
um this goes on and this is not not a
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
a knock on the chair um i know that the
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
chair is as frustrated as
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
some of us are where you can stick your
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
hand up and
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
i was currently i was on my telephone
 
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.670 align:start position:0%
i was currently i was on my telephone
earlier

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
and it was cutting in and out so i had
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
occasional uh
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
little bits of pieces that i could hear
 
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.470 align:start position:0%
little bits of pieces that i could hear
i

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
started up my computer and that problem
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
has gone away
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
but as we saw in our previous work
 
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.069 align:start position:0%
but as we saw in our previous work
sessions

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to make a point
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
and counter a point that you might want
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
to at the same time
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
and then as things go along you build up
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
while you're waiting and your hand is up
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
you you kind of make a little list of
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
things that points that you wanted to
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
counter along the way
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
and it turns into this long filibuster
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
not not intentional but just by
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
the way the process works so i just
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
put that objection out for
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these meetings and i find
 
00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:46.069 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these meetings and i find
it

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh it lacks transparency as to the issue
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh this is my fourth term and i believe
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
we've probably had
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
something on these uh these issues each
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
and every one of them
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
um end of life is a very
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
contentious issue just right up there
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
with abortion
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh startup life if you will and
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think we're getting anywhere
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
with this so i would
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that we do not recommend
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i yield the floor thank you very
 
00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:20.710 align:start position:0%
and i yield the floor thank you very
much

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
and representative sylvia in the words
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
of someone else
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
i would say i feel your pain i
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you how much i dislike this
 
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.190 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you how much i dislike this
process

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
um representative mclean
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you manager i i just want to
 
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:43.670 align:start position:0%
uh thank you manager i i just want to
say

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
that the reason that i think that this
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
is dangerous is because no matter what
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
and if the language even becomes very
 
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.710 align:start position:0%
and if the language even becomes very
tight

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
tight
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
it can love people i think into
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
a sense of security that hey we've got
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
this all buttoned up
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is it tends to
 
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is it tends to
normalize

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
normalize
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
things and then from there you can
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
proceed on to other things and
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
just listening to representative chase
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative chase mata
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
made a point when she was talking about
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
the belgian legislation
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
where he said well that's downright
 
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.349 align:start position:0%
where he said well that's downright
creepy

00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
creepy
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
and and we wouldn't do that here but
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
the belgians probably don't think it's
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
creepy because
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
i they've maybe gone through this
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
normalization process and
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
i really think that's we i don't think
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're ever going to get the language
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
that is so
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
tight that it it it kind of carries
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
through so that's my concern with this
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation thank you madam
 
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.230 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation thank you madam
chair

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
gordon

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i uh
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think think of it very much the same
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
way as representative woodbury has and
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
and that is uh our only decision really
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh make a recommendation that it be
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
further studied in the
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
next session so my decision it seems to
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
me that my decision today is
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
just whether or not i think we should
 
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.349 align:start position:0%
just whether or not i think we should
today

00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
vote to have this studied in the next
 
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
vote to have this studied in the next
session

00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
but i've listened carefully to
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative chase as well today and i
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
think she's done a very nice job
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh presenting the case but my my concern
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
if i vote just to pass it on to the next
 
00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:29.589 align:start position:0%
if i vote just to pass it on to the next
session

00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
then it is somewhat of an endorsement
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
and as i as as has been said this
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
this bill or a bill of this type has
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
been brought in
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
in virtually every session for a very
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing to prevent someone
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
from bringing a similar bill
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
to be studied in the next session
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
and if my concern is that if i say
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes i want this to be further study i am
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
endorsing the approach
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
i'm in effect endorsing this piece of
 
00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:03.190 align:start position:0%
i'm in effect endorsing this piece of
legislation

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
or this approach and saying i think this
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
is what should be studied so i think i'm
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
end up voting i take the same approach
 
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
end up voting i take the same approach
as

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
woodbury i i really think things should
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
be studied
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it necessarily should
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
be endorsed and i'm probably going to
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
vote against it
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative hargan
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
sarah i'm unmuted um i i
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm if i'm still planning to vote no
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is a perennial issue so i'm sure
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
we will have bills related to this topic
 
00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.190 align:start position:0%
we will have bills related to this topic
coming

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
coming in for year after year until
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
somebody finally thinks of something
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
that has consensus i
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think we've made a lot of advances in
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
hospice and palliative care
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
but i'm uh not sure whether physician
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide is a good
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
is a is a good idea given that we can do
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful things just with the hospice
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
hospice care
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
and also um and also
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's also worried about uh people
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
also worry about there's often
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
others also there's also a question of
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether like people severely disabled or
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
people you know who have terminal
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
illnesses whether or not their lives
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
are worth living and so the people who
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
are living those lives
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
may feel that they're may feel that life
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
is worth living but then those around
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
them they may
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
may not understand that so i think i'm
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
very concerned
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
i usually work very closely with the
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
disability communities often as often as
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
i can and they're
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're extremely worried about about
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill even though
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
even though many of them tend to be
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
pro-choice and other related issues some
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
also find just the final rhythm of
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
silvia said i the technology
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for but i think it's
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional and even some ways has
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
some advantages so like
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
when we get back to in-person meetings
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to say that's going to
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
the first week in january 2021 i think
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
we may you know consider changing some
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the ways we do the in-person meetings
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
too but um
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
anyway so i'm i'm still bit i still plan
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
to vote no even though i fully
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand that there will be more bills
 
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:07.270 align:start position:0%
understand that there will be more bills
and

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
um i look forward i look forward to uh
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
seeing those new bills in the areas and
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
pretty maybe pretty soon we can have
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
mass hearings and reptal again because
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
definitely a great uh exercise and
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
participatory participatory democracy
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
way back what seems like about 20 years
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
ago in
 
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.549 align:start position:0%
ago in
january

00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes i'm done thank you representative
 
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
yes i'm done thank you representative
burroughs

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
burroughs
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm gonna vote
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
which does not signify that um
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of um assisted suicide it
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
will be a measure of
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
believing that we need more discussion
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
and we have for as
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair said we have heard from a
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the state who um oppose um any type
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
of legislation of this sort
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to hear more i think
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
people in the state and in the
 
00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:05.190 align:start position:0%
people in the state and in the
legislature

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
really need to hear more from families
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
and individuals who find
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
themselves in these situations to better
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
understand it and
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's one reason that i will be voting
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes on this and i'm hoping that we get
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
to hear from those people
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative dilorenzo
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%

to be voting
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
no and i have a very strong opposition
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
mainly because of disparities in um
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
health care for minorities and poor
 
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:41.670 align:start position:0%
health care for minorities and poor
people

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
um and there's been a history of
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare disparities amongst african
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
americans when you go back
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
to the tuskegee um
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
syphilis trials on imprisoned men um
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
there were women who
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
there was a name dr marion i forget his
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
last name but he
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
experimented on african-american woman
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
and gave them
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
surgery without um any
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
anesthetic and i myself
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
had to go to the emergency room um a
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago i was having chest
 
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.470 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago i was having chest
pains

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
pains
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i went to the emergency room and they
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
did some tests tommy kept me overnight
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
and released me the next day
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
and they gave me a diagnosis of um
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
indigestion dyspepsia and so i followed
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
up with my pcp
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
and went to have a stress test
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
and i found the stress stress test the
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
next thing you know i was in a hospital
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
and it ended up that i had a
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
um black artery
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
and i i underwent a
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
an emergency catheterization and
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
i'm fine now it was all cleared up with
 
00:58:01.839 --> 00:58:03.109 align:start position:0%
i'm fine now it was all cleared up with
medication

00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
medication
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so i just feel like
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're not careful enough and we don't
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
know enough about end of life
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions and so i'm
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
totally against this bill
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much um
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative does anyone want to speak
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
if not representative welper i thank you
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
um i bel i believe that we
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
vote that house bill 1659
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
be not recommended for future
 
00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:39.510 align:start position:0%
be not recommended for future
legislation

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative i i
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
recognize you to speak
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
the conversations representative keynes
 
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:50.870 align:start position:0%
the conversations representative keynes
has

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so i'm not going to accept that at
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
this moment
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative keynes um indicated
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
that she wanted to speak um and without
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
having raised her hand but now she has
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
so representative keynes
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i i think we
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful about the
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
to say nothing about how we decide and
 
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
to say nothing about how we decide and
that

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
it we only go forward when there's a
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
majority in the public
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
this country spends millions of dollars
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
millions on medical procedures and
 
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
millions on medical procedures and
medical

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
devices and medical uh
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
items that only affect
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
less than 50 or 60 people across the
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
whole country
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think it's we should be in
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
the middle of that to be perfectly
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
honest with you i'm not even sure we
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
should be in the middle of any medical
 
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.309 align:start position:0%
should be in the middle of any medical
decisions

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
but i i think it's our a long
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're not taking into
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
consideration the small families that
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
have this happen to them and and they're
 
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.789 align:start position:0%
have this happen to them and and they're
not

01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
even if they all came forward that
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a ton of people that came
 
01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.670 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a ton of people that came
forward

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
i i find that most of my uh
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
most of my uh emails and whatever
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
came from groups that are affiliated
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
with churches
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to be religion doesn't
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to be it doesn't happen to be
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
one of my priorities um
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
and so whatever one believes in their
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
church that's fine and i hope it brings
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
them peace and comfort
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not for me um
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that one of the most poignant
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
things we got was the
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
letter from the lady with aoals i mean
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
she was in her 40s
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
and she was consigned to only having her
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
eyes to communicate
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the boston globe was an
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
article about
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
pete freddy's the ice bucket challenge
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
young man
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
and what he told his folks
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
specifically his dad was
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
that it was like being buried alive
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be in the position and
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
obviously neither one of these people
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
would have been able to take advantage
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
of this because i don't think they're in
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
a position to be able to
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
execute it in themselves they would have
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
had to depend on someone else and that's
 
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.069 align:start position:0%
had to depend on someone else and that's
not

01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
allowed but i i think we have to be very
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
careful about
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
well it's only a minority it's not the
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
majority opinion out there in it
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
look how long it took us how many
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
sessions it took us to get medical
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana passed
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
it was eons and and that's
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
not right it isn't we should not be
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
making medical decisions in the
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislature we should be
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
allowing the professionals to come
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
forward and listen to what they say
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
this thought reminds me of washington
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
right now you know and i
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's not right it's not right in my
 
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
it's not right it's not right in my
opinion

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
so that's my say and i'm done thank you
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%

ah i did not see that um
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%

okay now we can hear you
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay um good morning all
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
i've been listening carefully to this
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
conversation and i
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
i was one of the people that um was on
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
to help wendy do some some of the work
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
the preliminary work
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and i think you know as we've gone
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
forward and gotten a lot of
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
information in the mail from our our
 
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.430 align:start position:0%
information in the mail from our our
constituents

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
i've had a reaction to what i've gotten
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
because i felt
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
as though all of it almost all of the
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
letters and all the comments
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
were inflammatory starting out with
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
people talking about
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
this bill as assisted suicide it's not
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's something very different and i i
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
a clarity i think that's a definition
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
that people use
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
to inflame the issues so that um
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
large groups of people are in opposition
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
to it but more importantly i
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
i think what sandy was just saying is
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
really critical
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
i mean the analysis of the person who
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
felt like they were buried alive i just
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
so poignant we're not talking about this
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
as being
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
something that would be administered to
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
everybody we're talking about
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation is perhaps
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
being an option
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
and a choice that a person can make at
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
the end of their life
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that's critical i think a
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
lot of people are making that choice now
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
and we're just um pretending like
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of people in
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
hospice that are being heavily
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
medicated but ultimately the end result
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
is the same and
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
i just think it's difficult because we
 
01:04:33.359 --> 01:04:34.309 align:start position:0%
i just think it's difficult because we
haven't

01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
had an honest conversation well we've
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
had conversations and they've been
 
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.950 align:start position:0%
had conversations and they've been
honest

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
honest
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
but they've been so polarized by
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
political positions and emotions
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote forward vote for it to
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i support continued study and i
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
understand that we've
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
we've done it for 12 times in the last
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
several years but i just think it's an
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
issue that really needs
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
further investigation and i think there
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be better clarity
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of defining uh suicide as
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
comfort measures at the end of life
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um representative
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
chase do you have something to add that
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't been said
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
um i did well i just wanted to say
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
really quickly that i
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
found you all know about my daughter
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
my daughter wouldn't even have qualified
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
for this once we got you know i really
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
got looking at it so again i
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
i do feel that what would like to
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
find out in the what ifs and who really
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
would use this
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
are like als um ms even alzheimer's
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
is a questionable when you're living
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
like that in
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
in i can't breathe yes or you know it's
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
like drowning
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
these are just not great ways of living
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
and if somebody
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that decision i think
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
that that's again where we need to
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
really let this bill be studied
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
and consider all of these other areas of
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
illnesses and
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
as far as i just wanted to touch on the
 
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
as far as i just wanted to touch on the
medical

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
being able to i understand not getting
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
involved in the medical issues i've been
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
fighting that my entire life with my
 
01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:20.470 align:start position:0%
fighting that my entire life with my
daughter

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i just don't feel that
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
because of say the opiate epidemic and
 
01:06:26.319 --> 01:06:27.589 align:start position:0%
because of say the opiate epidemic and
personal

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
hand with what happened with my daughter
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
getting too much medication
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
at times i don't think that is something
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we should just give to the medical
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
community to do i don't feel that's
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
right for a doctor just to
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
say okay i'm going to give you these
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
pills you can take them when you want i
 
01:06:42.079 --> 01:06:42.390 align:start position:0%
pills you can take them when you want i
do

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
feel legislation does need to be a part
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
to at least set the guidelines in the
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
right and wrong
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
and be able to to decipher suicide
 
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.390 align:start position:0%
and be able to to decipher suicide
versus

01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
a person deciding to end their life that
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
fits all the criteria and i am going to
 
01:06:59.680 --> 01:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
fits all the criteria and i am going to
vote

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
yes that i believe this needs a lot more
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
study and it is definitely not going
 
01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.549 align:start position:0%
study and it is definitely not going
away

01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much without objection
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
close the work session on house bill
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
1659 and open
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
the executive session the executive
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
session has been noticed
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
which is why we can um
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
in violation of the way we ordinarily
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
would like to do this
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
and i look at representative sylvia's
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
name um out of respect for his comments
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
we are going to have an executive
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
session following immediately
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
the work session um and
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh opening up the executive session i
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
first want to ask representative welper
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%

01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
has um arrived um
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
who you do not have listed as presence
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
did you have representative langley as
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
president i know manager i did not
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
but why i have the opportunity to speak
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh it is part of the subcommittee
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
