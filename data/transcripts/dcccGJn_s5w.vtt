Monday March 10th edition of the science
 
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee we have
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
a morning of work sessions and an
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
afternoon of executive sessions so
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
before we get started I'll ask you all
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
to rise and join representative L relle
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
all okay thanks to
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
everyone with a little bit of luck by
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
the time we can conclude today's
 
00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
activities we will be done with our
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
house bills for
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
2025 and then we'll wait for Senate
 
00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.589 align:start position:0%
2025 and then we'll wait for Senate
bills

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
although we may retain a bill or two who
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
knows but um we will wait for Senate
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
bills which probably won't start heading
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
our way until about the 1st of April so
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
we'll have a little bit of a break over
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
the second half of March now we might
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
have time for some educational activity
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
during that period we'll see how it
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
goes so I want to begin this morning by
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
tackling some of the easy stuff first in
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
our work session and talk about
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
hp450 relative to commercial property
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
assessed clean energy and
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
resiliency also known as C
 
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
Pacer as you will
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
recall we passed Senate Bill four which
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
was the same bill with a couple of minor
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
edits earlier this year and that Bill
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
had already been passed by the Senate
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
when it came to us when we passed it
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
through the house it then went to the
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
governor's desk and it has been signed
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
into law therefore we
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
can without reservation itl House Bill
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
450 does anybody have any objection any
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
questions seems pretty straightforward
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
to me okay now let's talk about three
 
00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:53.829 align:start position:0%
to me okay now let's talk about three
more

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.949 align:start position:0%
more
complicated

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
bills complicated in the sense that
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
there are three of them
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
um but not that complicated in the sense
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
of what the bills are trying to do which
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
is to do something about residential
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
condominum condominium
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
property use of electric rates electric
 
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.230 align:start position:0%
property use of electric rates electric
meters

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
meters
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask representative
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
Bernardi who chaired a subcommittee work
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
issue to give us an unofficial and
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
informal review of the subcommittee's
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
activities and tell
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
us if they accomplished anything that we
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
can use so representative
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair yes so the
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met and uh reviewed
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
essentially two options one was to have
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
a named individual in the condo
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
association take the uh uh point of
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
being the person on the the common bill
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
for uh well and Sewer um and that was uh
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
not well received uh in many aspects so
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
a a um second alternative which is to
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
take one of the three bills and I think
 
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
take one of the three bills and I think
it's

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
539 537 okay uh so we're talking 537 539
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
and 680 take 537 and amend it to
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
basically say that uh condo uh
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
Association uh um can take that uh on
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
line and uh have it build by the
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
respective utilities at the residential
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
rate and the discussions from Unitil was
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
the only uh company here at the time um
 
00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
was that the concern was make sure that
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
it is taking a dedicated line for just
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
well and sewer and naming it as a line
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
that would be uh transferred to uh
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
residential billing as opposed to
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
commercial or what they call General
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
billing um and that it is not there's no
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirement to divide it amongst all the
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
potential individuals served by the line
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
so that is I what I believe our
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
amendment makes clear at least when
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
Unitil looked at the the uh um language
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
they they agreed with that
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the concerns earlier raised by
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
eversource W was that uh there's still a
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
potential for cheating if someone wants
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
and I'm using that word more boldly than
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
they did um if if they uh if if someone
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
if a condo association wanted to claim
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
something that really wasn't a well in
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
sewer line uh as as well as it
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
potentially opens this Prospect up for
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
coming to us in the future with well I
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
want to add uh the uh the common washer
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
dryer area or whatever else to the list
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
of of lines so that's where we were um
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask uh Tom Corman who
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
actually pursued the uh Amendment
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
language through OS to uh um give a
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
little more detail on it but that's
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
out representative Corman thank you Mr
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr clerk
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for that that
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
press yeah so there there were really
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
two issues going on one being that these
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
meters these are shared meters for
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
residential unit
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
for well and septic that's all we're
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
talking about well and septic
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
residential units shared meters there
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
are two issues one being that they were
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
charged uh or being buildt at commercial
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
rates because the bill was going to the
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners association rather than to
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
individual residential units and HOAs
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
are considered commercial and then how
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
to actually build the individual units
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
because not all HOAs have that ability
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
in their bylaws so what this amendment
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
does is it makes clear that if there is
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
a shared meter that is serving only
 
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
residential well or septic than it is to
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
be build at residential rates only those
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
meters and that the HOA shall build the
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
individual units on each meter
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
equally there were two additions that we
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
put in after the sub committee meeting
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
and those are applying to uh a municipal
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
or County aggregation in the case that
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
they're direct billing right now I don't
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
know of any that are but in case they're
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
direct billing so the same rules would
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
apply to them and then also it was
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out that there were some
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
Municipal Electric utilities and uh Miss
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
Stone was kind enough to send me a list
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
of every town in the state and every
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
utility serving that town for every
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
every service water sewer and electric
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I grabbed that web page that she sent
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
me I wrote some python code to parse out
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
um which are the municipal Electric
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
utilities to verify that that the only
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
utilities that were not the the four
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
that we usually see are municipal ones
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a section on Municipal
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities again just saying if
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're billing they're billing at
 
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.710 align:start position:0%
they're billing they're billing at
residential

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
rates thank you would you go through the
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
amendment uh line by line essentially
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
and tell us what the changes that the
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
amendment makes to the Le to the
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
original introduced Bill sure now of
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
course there were three introduced bills
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
so um so what what we decided was to
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
just take one of them and just put
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
everything in that so that we don't have
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
to vote on three things things and have
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
three different things on consent so the
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
idea would be to itl the other two yes
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes definitely it itl the other two if
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
we approve uh F the changes to
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
537 so uh let's see in section one uh we
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
changed let me get the original here so
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
compare we changed um what
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph oh gosh where is this original
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
we changed what paragraph We were
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
changing in section one I don't even
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
know if I have the original
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
here but anyway I know that we we
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
changed what paragraph We were changing
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
in section one uh and it seemed like uh
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph h of that particular uh
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the RSA was was the right
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
place to put it so uh we added and
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
whether any commercial or business
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
enterprises are permitted what we think
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
in is in the right
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
place um on section two we actually
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
moved that the original Bill had that I
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
think in RSA 378 which is about public
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
utilities but section two is about the
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
chargeback saying that the
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
HOA shall charge back the shared meter
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
costs to the individual units and it
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
didn't seem appropriate for that to be
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
in the RSA on public utilities it
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
belongs in the RSA on Condominiums so we
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
moved it to RSA 356b
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
which is about
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Condominiums so there's uh a new
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph paragraph 2A paragraph 2 is is
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
the paragraph that says essentially if
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
the hoa's bylaws allow it they can
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
charge back various things and then here
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh 2A says regardless of the condominium
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
instruments the cost shall be uh charged
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
back so even if the bylaws don't
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
specifically permit it then it it can be
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
septics um section three is essentially
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
the same as in the original bill um we
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
may have made some minor wording changes
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
but essentially the
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
same section
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
four uh at least uh lines
 
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
four uh at least uh lines
23

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
through um through two on the next page
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
on page two are the same and then we
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
added uh this new section uh on on lines
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
3 to8 of page two um we added this
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
section saying that uh this applies also
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
to Rural Electric cooperatives I think
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
that was in the original bill but we may
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
have changed where this goes I forget
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure that Rural
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
Electric cooperatives are covered
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
basically the New Hampshire Electric
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
Co-op and then sections five and six are
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
the same wording as before for but uh
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
for municipal and County aggregations
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
and for municipal Electric
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
utilities one other thing I want to
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
point out and I mentioned this in in the
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
email to the committee the amended
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
analysis on page three misses an
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
important point in in paragraph one
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
which is that this bill applies only for
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
res shared residential well and septic
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure everybody
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
understands that we're not talking about
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
shared lighting or heating a swimming
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
pool or anything like that it's really
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
septic representative Harrington yeah
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of changes here I just
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I don't
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not sure this is an issue or
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
not but I just wanted to make sure we're
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
being cons considered um the utilities
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
are regulated by the by the Pu whether
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're electric or water or sore
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
private utilities but Municipal
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities are exempt from their uh
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
approval so that doesn't create any
 
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.110 align:start position:0%
approval so that doesn't create any
problem

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
here I don't think so I mean the whole
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
point here is just how at what rate are
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
you building a particular meter right
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that the rates change
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that this particular
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
meter you're not building it at a
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
General commercial rate you're building
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
it at a residential rate because it is
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
use is 100% for residential units so it
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be up to I don't know the city
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
council or whatever to when they're
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing let's say the Water Company's
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh proposed rate structure um for that
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
town the municipal they would be the
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
ones who would be the enforcing body to
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
make sure they comply with the law and
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
not the Pu yeah and again this this
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
isn't even about the water this is about
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
the electric meter and that's all it's
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
only about the electric meter serving a
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
a well pumped or a septic
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
system okay so it's not for water just
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
just for electricity it's for getting
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
water via electricity but it's it's not
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
for water service we still have some
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
inicial electric companies as well so
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right and and and and you
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
know that's why I wrote The Python code
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
to find that there were five okay thank
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas oh Wendy
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes thank you Mr chair um in
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
describing the uh Amendment you said
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
that the HOA would build
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
equally God bless
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
you um does that mean they would they
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
would split the bill according to the
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
number of households that are on the
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
meter and my second question is are the
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
HOAs allowed to add a management fee to
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
this now that they have to split the
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
bills or is that beyond the scope of
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
this so uh to your first question yes so
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
if there were two houses or two units uh
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
being served by a meter they are build
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
equally uh we didn't really think about
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
a management fee I mean the HOA has
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
various billing that they do one other
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
point I I could have made and should
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
have made is that the way things are
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently regardless of whether these
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
Wells uh the these meters are built at
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
residential or commercial rates what's
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
happening is that the bill goes to the
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
HOA and the HOA distributes that cost
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
over all the units in the condo so
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
what's happening is people who are not
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
being served by these shared meters are
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
paying a part of those shared meters and
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
the whole point here is No it should be
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
paid only by the people who the meters
 
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.430 align:start position:0%
paid only by the people who the meters
are

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
serving um my additional question follow
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
up are we in discussion or all right
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
follow up whatever um my additional
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
question is um how do you differentiate
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
between a unit that has two people in it
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
and a unit that has eight people in it
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
which is obviously going to be using
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
more more more energy more electricity
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we thought about that and there's
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
really just no way to tell right the the
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
meter it's one meter the meter is the
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
meter and and this is the only feasible
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
with so I was told that there may be
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
some concerns with this amendment
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
language so I would like to ask Miss
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
Stone from the Department of energy if
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
she has any
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about this amendment
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
consider good morning and welcome back
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chair uh for
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
the record Megan Stone with the
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um the department
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
does still have some concerns um with
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
this we do have some concerns um like
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas raised uh that if
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
there depending on whether there's two
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
units or or more units that uh might be
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
on one meter we also do still have some
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
concerns about um other lines that may
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
be running to the meter uh what it
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's a shared laundry facility
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
or um something like that that could be
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
more common use and whether the
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to to go inspect
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
all of these lines to make sure they are
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
just well in septic um or if there are
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
things running to that and then if you
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
have to change lines um and all the
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
implications that come with that and the
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
cost um so we do still have some
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with that um and we the
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
department still also has some concerns
 
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.350 align:start position:0%
department still also has some concerns
with

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.070 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
how basically how would a change impact
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
cost recovery um and through rates and
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
then ultimately how would that flow to
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
all customers we do so there would be a
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
cost shift there and we do still have
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
that could you explain that cost shift a
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
little in a little more detail please
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
with if you're changing the rate um
 
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
there could be a potential underc
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
collection of costs for the
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
utility by by changing the rate from
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
commercial to indust to residential
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Corman thank you Mr
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
chairman right and and I understand the
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
point I I would argue that in fact
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
what's been happening is there's been a
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
cost shift where people who are are
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
using these meters for just residential
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
units are paying more than they should
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
have because they were getting charge
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
use representative
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
Harrington I I think the issue on cost
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
shifting is um has to be addressed
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
somewhat so the utility now collects x
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars because they're
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
building them as commercial and
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
Industrial if they make this change
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
they'll be built as residential and
 
00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:29.799 align:start position:0%
they'll collect something less than x
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
amount it'll be x minus something and I
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
think with the bills intend of the bill
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
is to say well that's what they should
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
be collecting but the utilities is not
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to say oh well we'll just eat that
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
difference they're going to say I'm
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to apply that cost to
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else now and I think that's the
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
question where does the cost get applied
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
to because it's going to be rain neutral
 
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.470 align:start position:0%
to because it's going to be rain neutral
representative

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
Bernardi so uh contemplated this issue
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
um I think we are dealing with uh about
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
100501 C4
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
institutions uh that this may be
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
eligible they may be eligible to use
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
this if they had lines that were single
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
service to well and or septic if they
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
don't have such a line they're not
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for any change in their in
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
their building
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
here uh so um when you look at what the
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
difference in the rates were and uh uh
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
Mr sweat presented some data here it was
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
around uh $2 a month so uh you look at
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
that and say how
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're at uh what
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
$240 a year for if all the uh groups in
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
the that are eligible had such a had
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
such a line uh you're you're now at uh
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
What uh uh
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
$20,000 that that would be shifted from
 
00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:17.029 align:start position:0%
$20,000 that that would be shifted from
uh

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
from a commercial rate to a residential
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
rate so the utilities are out
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
$20,000 across all of New Hampshire I I
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
I think that amount of cost shifting is
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
in the weeds it is just non it doesn't
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
make any sense it's it's it's less than
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
Mills so yes indeed that $20,000 is
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to be distributed over all
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
residential customers in the state and
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
is we wouldn't see it representative
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
Corman and and uh adding to
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard's point I think
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to be less than that
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.669 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to be less than that
because

00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
I think what we're seeing is uh
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
condo uh condos where many of the meters
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
are single unit and only some of them
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
are shared so I mean the total number of
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
meters that we're talking about in the
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
that Miss Stone you have anything to add
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so I think that was
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
that was all for thank you I understand
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
eversource may also have some concerns
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
with this language so I would invite
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
them to share those concerns with us if
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
much welcome back Mr
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm now properly a lobbyist
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
that um so thank you uh members of the
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh Griffin Roberge with
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
eversource energy yes uh eversource does
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
have concerns with the proposed language
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
mostly on sections um one and three um
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
you know eversource classifies service
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
to its customers as either residential
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
or commercial with different rate
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
options available within those each
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
within each uh broad rate class and
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
those rates are developed uh quite
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
equitably based upon the costs of
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
service to the different types of
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
customers um the language would uh here
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
appears to um give condo associations
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
the means to bypass the appropriate
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
process for rate designation um and
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
effectively in a way game the system as
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
a result of this you know there is the
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
potential as dewe mentioned for the
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
under recovery of costs and an
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
inequitable uh cost shift between
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
residential and non-residential
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
customers um I know there was some
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
discussion here a moment ago regarding
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
what that amount might be
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
I certainly couldn't put a number on
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
that but at least from a very broad
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
level we do anticipate that a cost shift
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
would occur here um we also do frankly
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
view this as respectfully a precedent
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation as you are
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
essentially giving a carve out to
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
certain entities to pick and choose what
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
rate classification they fall under um
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
it does you know open the door for
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
potentially future entities to come in
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
and maybe do the same you know we would
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
submit that respectfully customers
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
should not be in a role of making these
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
determinations there are metering and
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
Engineering considerations that need to
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
take place when it comes to uh rate
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
designations and we think that that is
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately you know set through you
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
know our tariff structure and how that
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
is all uh done over at the Public
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I do recall um
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
additionally that um there has been
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on a bill last year that was
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
in the house Commerce Committee that has
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
very similar language that there was a
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
non legislative solution to this I
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
believe there still is a non-legislative
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
solution to this um and we wanted to
 
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:06.519 align:start position:0%
certainly share those concerns here with
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
folks um you know before this bill kind
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
of moved forward um and I'll stop there
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
in case anybody has any questions so is
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
there specific language in this
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that could be changed to
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
resolve any issues you might have or do
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
you think this whole uh amend needs to
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
be thrown out so thank you for the
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
question I think our Focus would
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
certainly be on sections one and three
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh because that directly affects I think
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
our operations at ever Source I
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully don't want to be in the
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
position for speaking for Rural Electric
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
cooperatives Municipal Utilities and
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
that type of thing um regarding section
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
two you know looking at that a little
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
bit closely um that looks like it's a
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
requirement that's placed on condo
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
associations as to how um a bill would
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
be paid under this structure um you know
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
I think I did hear um representative
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
Corman mention that you know the condo
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
association doesn't have this provision
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
in their in their bylaws um you know
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's a question for the committee as to
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not they feel a legislative
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
language to cure this issue for the
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
condo association is feasible is the
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate path or whether or not the
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:26.919 align:start position:0%
bylaws anybody else have a question to
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Cor
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um the the the
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is quite specific that we're
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
talking only about septic and well pumps
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
for residential units so I don't think
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
there's any ambiguity and any danger
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
here of it going to anything else in
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
terms of of trusting whether the
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
customer is truthful I mean you have to
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
do that already you know I'm I'm not an
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
eversource customer I'm a liberty
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
customer and Liberty believes me that I
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
am am a resident and not a business I
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
could just as easily be setting up a uh
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
a shop in my basement where I make boot
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
scrapers and sell them and turn my house
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
into a commercial entity and Liberty
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
would be none the wiser so I I think to
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
some degree if a condo association says
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
this meter is going only to residential
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
well and
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
septic I I think it behooves you to
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
believe them unless you have reason not
 
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.990 align:start position:0%
believe them unless you have reason not
to

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.470 align:start position:0%
to
sure

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh I I guess I'll comment on that um so
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
you know again we do view it as frankly
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
a precedent that it even if it is
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored it is essentially a
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
carveout for certain types of systems
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
that receive electric service um
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
obviously no current legislature can
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
bind the future legisl legislature so
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
you know this does open the door for you
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
know moving certain entities with with
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
unique rate classifications into others
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
um again you know the other thing I
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
would I would comment on is I do believe
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the condo associations uh pumps in
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
question here um you know they are
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
registered as a commercial Enterprise
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State um which
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
does label them as a commercial uh
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
entity um you know our tariffs also
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
include language that you know defines
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
how those um how those rate
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
classifications are offered out um you
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
know I just offer that I guess for the
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee's awareness and you know
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
obviously the legislature will do what
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants to do but
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
certainly again just wanted to share our
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
concerns with the
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Ro bear nice to see you again
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
good to see you um so I have two
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh you mentioned that a
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
similar B came up last year and that
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
there is a non-legislative fix so could
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
you inform us as to what that would be
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
would that be the utility taking some
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a making some kind of an effort
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
to assist these folks who our residents
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you for the question so
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
you know in looking at this you know
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
this condo association is not an
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
eversource customer the one that is the
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
focus of this bill obviously um there
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
are other conduit associations that we
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
provide service to what this bill's
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
impact will be to any other condo
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
association you know we'd have to do a
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
deeper dive but there is that potential
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
um regarding your um your question about
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
a non-legislative solution you know as I
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
think I heard there there might be a
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
solution there and I'm trying to
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
remember from last year but um the bill
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
did end up before the house Commerce
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
Committee It Was Defeated over there um
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
we do um we do feel that you know if
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of who pays what um you
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
know I think that's something that the
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
condo association would be able to
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
potentially work out with its own
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
members with its own uh condo unit
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
owners um you know I think respectfully
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
P moving forward a bill to create a
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide solution to what is an
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise localized issue could have
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
consequences follow up thank you Mr
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
chair um so the second thing is that you
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
had exception with the bolded language
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
on page two section three you didn't say
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
what specifically was that issue for you
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
I am very sorry say lines one more time
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
um section three you said you you just
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
generally said we have a problem with
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
Section one section three but can you
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
tell us what's wrong with section three
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
in your opinion yeah sure again it's
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's I guess as I mentioned earlier it
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
is creating that carve out essentially
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
for certain types of entities certain
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
types of service uh to be moved from One
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
Rate classification to another um I
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
understand that you know in the public
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
hearing that there was some debate as to
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not the uh use is residential
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
or commercial again we follow the
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
language under our tariffs this language
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
would essentially create a carve out and
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
allow people to move off of One Rate
 
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.069 align:start position:0%
allow people to move off of One Rate
onto

00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
onto
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
another correct that is the point of the
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill yeah no I understand and that is
 
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.829 align:start position:0%
bill yeah no I understand and that is
our

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
concern representative Thomas has a
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
question Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
um I understand your concern about um
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
that this is a precedent and that um
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
customers might start challenging this
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
but isn't wrong wrong if they're
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
classified in the wrong category and
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
they're paying more than they should
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
isn't it is it a bad thing for our
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
constituents to pay less sure and thank
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
you for the question so you know again
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
not our customer but you know could also
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
imp could impact condo associations
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
across our service territory um you know
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily have a direct answer
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
to an equity question but you you know I
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
can only just speak to the matter at
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
hand is that the entity is a commercial
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh is registered as a commercial entity
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the state it is rightly charged
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
commercial rates um and again passing
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
this language would create a type of
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
carve out for a specific type of entity
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
um which you know kind of jumps over the
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
language that utilities have in their
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
tariffs which are properly adjudicated
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
and set up before the Public Utilities
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
Commission um through extended dockets
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
and proceedings so I'll leave it there
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you you representative Harrington
 
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
has a question yeah I think getting back
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
to the non-legislative solution which to
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
me is always a preferred way of doing
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
things we have plenty of laws I don't
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
think we need more uh my understanding
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
would be if the condo association
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
rewrote their rules and simply said the
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
president of the condo association shall
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
be build for electric use for sore
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
common soore and water and the amount of
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
this bill should be distributed evenly
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
among all all condo members that would
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
take care of the problem because it
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
would be an individual's name in the
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
billing and the utility with then charge
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
the residential rate is that correct yes
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
that that is a potential path you know I
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
I'm you know obviously it's the condo
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
association to determine what path might
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
be suitable but I believe that there are
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solutions that could be
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
chair so my question would be whether uh
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
whether eversource would be amenable to
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
that type of change because it would be
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
the same type of carot right because
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
currently the homeowners
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
association is already filed and and
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
dealt with as a commercial entity by the
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
utility so just changing who the bill
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
goes to that wouldn't necessarily assist
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
them with the rate correct uh not necess
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
I don't believe you're correct not
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily but again there is if there
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
is that rate change again going back to
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
what I said earlier there is that
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
potential for that under recovery of
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
costs and a cost shift to occur and an
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
undefined amount again I will admit I
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
don't have you know hard and fast
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
figures as to what that cost shift would
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
be okay I'll leave
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
it representative Corman thank you yeah
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
so during the subcommittee we had an
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
attorney here uh who really was against
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of trying to build any
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
individual uh unit owner for these
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
shared meters uh and even if it's the
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
president of the
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
HOA that's an individual rather than the
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
HOA itself doing the billing so I mean
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
imagine if you were the president of an
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
HOA and you have a unit owner who is
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
recalcitrant in actually paying and if
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's that they're not paying you that's
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
a very different situation from if
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
they're not paying the HOA sure and and
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would say you know again it
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
is up to a condo association to
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
determine if you know what PS what path
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
they would want to go down for any
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
potential non-legislative solution
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether that's moving the uh name of the
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
account uh from the condo association to
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
a resident and then splitting up the
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
costs um but again those are potential
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
solutions that could be could be done
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
non- legislatively um and don't need
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
okay Mr bro Burge thank you thank you
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
input so as I think about this issue my
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law lives in a
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
condo type uh development and she pays
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
HOA fees and I have read on her behalf
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
the HOA agreement rules
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and I'm having trouble figuring out
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
how is residential well and septic
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
although her Association doesn't have
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
either but how is that different from
 
00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:07.670 align:start position:0%
either but how is that different from
for

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
example shared landscape services or
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
shared snow plowing
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
Services the
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
HOA pays for
 
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.829 align:start position:0%
HOA pays for
those

00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
and each individual resident pays their
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
share by paying their HOA fee
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that couldn't that cover
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
these um these meter fees these well and
 
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
these um these meter fees these well and
septic

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
septic
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
fees if I may uh you may yeah thank you
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I I don't think the analogy
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
quite works because we're talking about
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
meters that are
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
serving just residential units as
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh the the landscaping or the
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
laundry which is serving the
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
entire uh development we're talking
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
about meters that are serving in
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
individual you know like two units and
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's just for their residential use I
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
mean there's in in terms of of the use
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's really no different from if it was
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
a single meter for a single unit here
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a shared meter for for two
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
units but doing the very same thing so
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
taking that cost of that meter that
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
shared meter and and distributing it
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
over the entire condo doesn't seem to
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
make sense if you're going to do that
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
you might as well just take all the
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
individual meters and share them over
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
the condo which I don't think you want
 
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.349 align:start position:0%
the condo which I don't think you want
to

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
bernardy yes uh thank you Mr chair I I
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
think if I understood your um
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
example the relevant uh issue would be
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
here if the landscape service or the
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
snowplow service said to the condo
 
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.870 align:start position:0%
snowplow service said to the condo
association

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh our billing rate for you
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
is 50 bucks an hour but the house next
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
door since it's a residential unit we
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
build them 25 bucks an hour for
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
landscape work and and uh and for snow
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
plowing I think that would be the
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
relative you know uh circumstance that
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
that that would apply so this is an
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
being charged more be just because of
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
the name of on the bill as opposed to
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
is okay further discussion on
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
this all right seeing none we'll have to
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
decide later on what we're going to do
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
about all this but that was a good
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it explored all the
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
issues let's move on now to House Bill
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
266 which is a bill
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
that has turned out to be quite um
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
complicated and
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
controversial as the department of
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
energy and the Public Utilities
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
Commission kind of have a disagreement
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
about how to
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
handle adjudications so representative
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
Harrington has been sort of leading the
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
charge to try to come up with a solution
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
solution to this dilemma and I'm going
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
to let him explain what he's learned and
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
what he's come up with well what I
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
haven't learned is where my copies are I
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't know I sent a quest up to the
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
fourth floor and nothing's happened so I
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't know where where they were at uh
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
but I can read you what I what was
 
00:46:46.359 --> 00:46:47.710 align:start position:0%
but I can read you what I what was
proposed

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
anyways um hang on a second
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Matson has volunteered to
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
go up to the fourth floor to see if she
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
can find them so please do thank you was
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
just sen up well he's already gone
 
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:04.270 align:start position:0%
just sen up well he's already gone
anyways

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
um there's there's kind of two issues
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
here the first one was who gets to
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
appear where and who makes that decision
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
and it appears as if the department of
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
energy has kind of conceded to the Pu
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
that they'll be involved in all cases
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
and it's the amount of that involvement
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
and how much they do that's still of
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
question I'll let the various uh parties
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
talk about this
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
a new issue has come up though and
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
that's the um right to appeal and
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
adjudication by the Pu by Doe and that
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
to me I'm not sure if it's it's a major
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
issue but it certainly brings up an
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
issue of having one state agency
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
represented by the Attorney General's
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
office suing another state agency
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
represented by a different individual in
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General office in the
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh maybe that's done a lot
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just not familiar with it but I I
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
just think it's an issue that would have
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
to at least be addressed to make sure
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that's okay to do so uh that's the
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
issues right now and uh and I I think
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
the individual people should probably
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
best speak from both the Pu and
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
Department of energy as to exactly what
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
their issue is on they could explain it
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
what their concerns are better than I
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
you so did you come up with some
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
language for House Bill 266 to address
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
this issue the latest version is what it
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
says it's added to uh section section
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
two and it says um uh the department
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
shall have the authority to petition any
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings before the Public Utilities
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
Commission and shall automatically be a
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
party to all proceedings that's that's
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
presently the way it says and then and
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
have full party status and the right to
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
appeal in any adjudicative or non-
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding that's the new
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's new language and uh that is the
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay who do you suggest discuss that
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
language I would like to hear from the
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
Pu and from the Department of energy
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative Corman thank you uh
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
so representative Harrington just so I'm
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
clear here uh the the amendment you
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
filed uh restores The Struck uh text in
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
line 8 and removes the Bold text in line
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
10 is that correct yes it kind of goes
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
back to the way it was with the
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
exception of the sentence that I just
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
read so adding the Bold text in lines 8
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
and N but not in line 10 yes thank you
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
the but the new bold text that brings up
 
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
the right to appeal that's new I don't
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
know which version you have but
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay let's hear what the department
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
of energy has to say first then we'll
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
Pu good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
the committee Matt Young um brother the
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
record my name is Matt Young an attorney
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
at the department of energy um apologies
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to work off my phone for uh
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment text in the um Bill text
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:09.309 align:start position:0%
uh so
first

00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Harrington's uh
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
correct that the uh the amendment would
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
leave in the uh be up the language in
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
section two which says that we would be
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
a party to all proceedings um and then
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the um language on the right
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
to appeal
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh I do believe that right to appeal
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
language was included in the int as
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
introduced um and I can help clean sort
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
of clear up the question about uh
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
appealing and kind of who's against who
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
and an appeal so in
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess thinking of the Pu sort of
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
like a court there's there's obviously
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
two parties one of which is the
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
department um and then uh you know
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
usually utility and I guess there could
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
be even more parties OCA uh any
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
interveners and when an appeal is made
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's an appeal of the Pu order
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
and um the party who is appealing is
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
appealing that decision and the other
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
party would essentially be defending
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
that position so it's not NE it's not a
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um sort of as described by
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington where it would
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
be doe versus um the Pu on an appeal
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's really just an appeal of that
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
decision um so I do hope that clarifies
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
that and then I guess also I would say
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Justice does have
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
representatives for each state agency so
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
in an event where a state agency would
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
um sue another state agency there are
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative councils from the
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice on either side of
 
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
that again that's that's not really what
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
what this would be um but just wanted to
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
point that
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
out okay anybody have a question for the
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
doe representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr Young for being
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
here again um I my question is really um
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
where the impetus for the bill came from
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious what you're hoping to
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
achieve I understand what the language
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
is asking us to um put into statute but
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
where did it come from what what was the
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
driving force in wanting to have a
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislative update
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
here so um it's really a clarifying bill
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think we sort of look at it um sort of
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
clar clarifying the status quo
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
um I think some of the uh important
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
language in there and again sorry
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
looking at my phone um language in
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
section one that uh just sort of
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies that uh we can complete the
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
record as determined by the department
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
um we sort of looked at that as uh the
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
word complete is could be you know what
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
is a complete record it's a little vague
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
um so it just allows the department sort
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
of determine what it introduces as
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
evidence in a pu
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
proceeding okay and but the language May
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
followup yes um oh yeah it's always
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
we're in a work session so it's just we
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're in we weird rules here um but the
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
section that uh representative
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington was referring to in terms of
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
the changes in section
 
00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
three uh starting on line 8 that section
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
is a place where there's a little bit of
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
an additional there's a there's a the
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
right to
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
appeal uh was added so was there a
 
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.870 align:start position:0%
appeal uh was added so was there a
concern

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
with um was there a concern with an
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
inability to appeal or was there a
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
concern with uh judicative
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
results that needed to be appealed I
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
mean where did that come from so I I I
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
do recall that um I believe Deputy
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
Commissioner elm's testimony to sort of
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the bigger issues um I
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
think I can just point to that it's that
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
language really just just sort of
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
clarify the party status the full party
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
status of the department um when the uh
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
Department was created prior to that
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
there was some questions of P staff
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
involvement in the in the proceedings
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this just sort of
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
clarifies the distinction there oh and
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
have there been appeals in the
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
new I wouldn't want to speculate um I'm
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
I in in my time I'm trying to think um
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
but again this just sort of clarifies
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
what we to be true what we believe to be
 
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.510 align:start position:0%
what we to be true what we believe to be
true

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
now representative Harrington just so
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're clear on this then in the past
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
before the department of energy the
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
staff on the Pu worked for the Pu and
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
was part of the Pu so they very they
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't appeal a puc decision because
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
they were they were instrumental in in
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
making getting that decision because
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
they could speak to the U the
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners exp partti actually and
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
that was one of the big reasons for the
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
reorganization so now you're saying that
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
the department of energy should be
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
acting independently and if they
 
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
disagree with a ruling by the Pu that
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability to appeal
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
that to the Supreme Court that's the
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
change correct correct and that's the
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
only change you're proposing in the
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
266 well I so I do believe that that
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
that language was included in the bill
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
as introduced yes but the the previous
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
the other changes you taking out so 266
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
remains it's the only change to the
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
existing law is this paragraph about
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
repealing appealing no it would okay
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get straight
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
no no it would be everything and then I
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
believe the Amendment language does just
 
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.230 align:start position:0%
believe the Amendment language does just
uh

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
replace just the part of section two
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
leaving in everything else and but the
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
thing that does change in section two is
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the part the department will remain
 
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
a party to all proceedings okay so that
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
language is not struck okay that's not
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
struck but the rest of the 266 as
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
introduced is still in effect that's
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get straight I'm okay
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
because what it was sent to me I got
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
part of it and not the whole not the
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
whole bill so so we what I really would
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
like is if you could give us a copy of
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing the entire 6 266
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay whatever changes you want to see in
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
it because we get two pieces here and
 
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to match them up to
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
thanks and we don't have much time
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
because we have to have an amendment by
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Thomas uh Wendy
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um the Pu when
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
they testified they said that they felt
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would slow down
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
dockets um does this amendment um and
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
proposed change address that or if you
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:38.109 align:start position:0%
agree with that
statement

00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
um so we would be a party to um with
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment we would remain a party
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
to all proceedings as as inquired so I
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't it doesn't really make changes to
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
the structure
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
of and and I will say Mr chair that uh I
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
do believe the language that was sent
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
would is an accurate Amendment that
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
would reflect ultimately what we would
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
want in the
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill but we'd be happy to provide the
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
full text of what we would like 266 to
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
look like to represent of Harington as
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately we don't have a copy
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
issue and representative Matson went up
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
to the fourth floor and there is no copy
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
up there correct no and she checked with
 
00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.470 align:start position:0%
up there correct no and she checked with
the

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
the who writes the Amendments and they
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
don't have any request for an amendment
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
s an
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
fromer all
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
right I guess we're gonna we're gonna
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
let the the Pu give us their take on
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment even though we don't know
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
what the amendment is
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
um and we'll just have to go from there
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
I guess so thank you Mr Young appreciate
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
it next we'll call up Mr ell from the
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
Pu I assume that you have received a
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment is that would that
 
00:58:03.839 --> 00:58:04.910 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment is that would that
be

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
correct I hesitate to say that Mr
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
chairman Alexander spidel New Hampshire
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
P um it seems like this is a work in
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
progress but I can offer some conceptual
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
thoughts regarding the PC's positioning
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
on this General Bill and please and it
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
seems that the department is
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
contemplating further amendments as the
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
morning wear on so uh leaving aside the
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
exact language of the bill there's still
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
the resourcing issue that I believe I
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't here on last Monday but I believe
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
that chairman goldner talked about the
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
potential need to for additional
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
resources at the commission related to
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
this bill because there's not really an
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
understanding from the Pu side as to how
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
and when the doe will provide analytical
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
support so we'll leave that aside but
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's still a live issue for us the
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
other two live issues
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
I would say that the PC position is
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
developing where we're suggesting that
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
this could definitely use an interim
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
study type vehicle um a committee review
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
because I don't share attorney Young's
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
confidence that the puc decision will
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
not be supported by the Department of
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
Justice before the reviewing Court which
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
is the Supreme Court so I'll give an
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
example to my knowledge there has been
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
no doe appeal before The Supreme Court
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
of any P decision so it hasn't been
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
adjudicated since 2021
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
the most recent appeal that we can
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
definitely talk about is uh there was an
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
appeal by Liberty Utilities of the
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
Granite Bridge decision back in roughly
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
2019 2020 and that
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
decision in Conformity with the usual
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
practice of the Department of Justice
 
00:59:44.589 --> 00:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
that decision by the P was being
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
defended at the Supreme Court by
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel so uh the PC is not ready to
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
concede that there wouldn't be
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice support of the
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
agency's decision-making just like when
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
the department dep of safety makes an
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
adjudication at one of its hearings
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly you have Department of Justice
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
support of that before The Supreme Court
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
so that's an open question for
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
consideration the other piece for
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
consideration is that
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
um I I wouldn't necessarily
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
expect that the department of energy
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
itself knows uh its procedural posture
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
in in every proceeding and it can get
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
complicated where you can have
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
situations such as uh the department of
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
energy is in partial agreement with a
 
01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:35.039 align:start position:0%
given party on a decision but not in
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
full agreement so that's a gray area
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
that we think probably the the safest
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
ground would be for um this amended Bill
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
however it looks to be referred to a
 
01:00:46.839 --> 01:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
however it looks to be referred to a
study

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
committee interesting thank you
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr spidel for being here
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so we just had testimony from um from
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
doe that they're not talking about an
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court or with or
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
with doj's involvement but rather the
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
ability for the Department of energy to
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
appeal decisions of the Pu in order to
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
sort of keep them moving or question
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
results or you know have some input to a
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
decision that they think is not uh in
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
the best interest or appropriate and as
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
the department of energy I think they
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
think they probably should be playing
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
that role so what you just talked about
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
was something much broader which is a
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
suit that was brought on on the granite
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
Bridge Project to the Supreme Court I
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what the doe is
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
asking for did you did you get that from
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
the testimony it it seems that way
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
because right now under the
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act any person
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
may seek rehearing of the commission's
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
decisions before the commission itself
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
so there's uh administrative law there's
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
a concept called exhaustion of
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
administrative remedies so you have the
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
initial decision by the administrative
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
agency aka the commission then you have
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
a rehearing now if the re-hearing is
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
denied and the person or party is still
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
grieved including the department of
 
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:12.039 align:start position:0%
energy because they have sought
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
re-hearing of certain commission
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
decisions then you have a trigger where
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
they could go and seek appeal before The
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and I think that's what
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
they're trying to nail down that seems
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
to be the case um in general terms
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
there is uh you know we're trying to
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
proceed with caution we're not saying
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
that this is completely uh out of line
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
we're just we're struggling with working
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
out all the details and we think that it
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
would be important to examine those
 
01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative Thomas
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
um previously when the Pu testified that
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
they they mentioned that this would
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
require more resources people hires um
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
and you just mentioned it as well and
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
yet there's no fiscal note attached to
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
this where's the disparity on
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to jog my memory as to
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
whether number one the commission was
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
asked for a fiscal note and it may have
 
01:03:17.789 --> 01:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
been marked as
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
indeterminant and so I I'm not certain
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
of that I would have to look that up
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay but you follow up um but you
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
definitely say that if this passes
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
people would be need to be hired well
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
the commission is concerned that if we
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
can't rely on an analytical product from
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy in these
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
situations that it would be prudent for
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
the commission to develop more internal
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
resources to address those issues okay
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you this bill was introduced
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
without a phys fiscal note so I assume
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
that means nobody was consulted about
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal issues I I don't hesit I I I
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
hesitate to make that determination sir
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
know representative
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington the original bill which had
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
the department of energy making the
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
decision of which docket to join and
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
which one is not to has been changed now
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
the latest bill I believe doesn't that
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
discretion is not there anymore they're
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
they're me a party to all and so I don't
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
think we need the additional resources
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the Pu if the if the do de the
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy is going to be
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
there for every every issue because that
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's been taken out of the latest
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
version uh yes um I would say that yes
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to be present there but it
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
could just be a very minimal sort of a
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
chip on the bumper presence versus an
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
active presence I'm not s sure that it's
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
always going to be an active presence
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
followup yes followup they could do that
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
I mean today there's nothing specific
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
that tells them you will do whatever as
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
directed by the Pu they just they make a
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
filing and they can make it as comp Lex
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
or as simple as they decide
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
correct there's no statutory language
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
that informs them that you will provide
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
the Pu with what they request uh well
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
this is open to some discussion but the
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
12p statute says that there's to provide
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
administrative support to us in our
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
adjudications and that's being changed I
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
Believe by this bill if I'm not mistaken
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have to get the latest
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
version I thought that part was was take
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
was taken out so we'll have to get back
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
to the Department of energy on that if
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
version yes I think it would be useful
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
to get the latest version as soon as
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
possible so see if you
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
can see if you can make that happen
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
later um I guess we're going to have to
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
suspend further discussion on this bill
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
I remember from the public hill before
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
you let you go though I do remember from
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that one of the
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
contentious issues here was that the
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy did not want the Pu
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
to tell them what they had to do what
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
do they did the the department wanted to
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
make that decision on their
 
01:06:08.279 --> 01:06:11.190 align:start position:0%
make that decision on their
own

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
and could you refresh my memory what
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
your reaction is to that request by the
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
department I wasn't there on Monday last
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
Monday but I've been involved in some of
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
the internal discussions regarding the
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
Department's bill and there's a level of
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
respect by the commission for the
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
Department moving in that direction but
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that everything's
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
ticked and tied and clear and
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore uh it would be again wise
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
for the commission to say okay if the
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
department is going to do its own thing
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
and sail in its own Direction and I
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
believe that chairman goldner also
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
Express the position that you know he's
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
okay with our not being administratively
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
attached for the back office stuff
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
that the department helps us with now
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
it's okay if the puc handles that in
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
house but regarding the analytical work
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
we should probably staff up to a certain
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
extent and make sure that um that's
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
being adequately taken care of but it
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
seems like this is a little bit of a
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
moving Target Mr chairman where the
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
Bill's impetus or its uh points of
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
emphasis is changing a little bit and so
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
we're just saying okay we ought to know
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
where this lands and where it lands we
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
ought to have some input and discuss
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you I appreciate
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman all right
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to not discuss this bill
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
anymore because I I think we're not
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to be able to make much
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
progress so we're going to move
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
on Mr chairman just one final comment
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative and this was to the Pu
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
you realize that the latest version has
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
taken out that sentence about it put it
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
back in it says proceeding to all
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
parties having to deal with with the doe
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
back okay well we we'll get I assume
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
you're working on something over there
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
the doe right to get us a paper copy as
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
now representative Bernardi just
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
reminded me that OSS will not respond to
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
emails for amendments anymore you either
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
have to use the online portal I'm not
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
sending it to them to the people
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
upstairs oh you were sending it to
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
committee they didn't get it I've been
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
trying to send it to Robin so she could
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
do it and I keep getting rejected back
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
here I must be typing something wrong
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
whatever uh but her email address comes
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
back and just says it's not valid so I
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going on Davis if you
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
can help we'd we'd appreciate
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
it but it I will remind you
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington if the time
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
comes to go try to retrieve an amendment
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
from OS you can't do it via email you
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
have to do it either by phone by the bo
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the portal or in
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
person all right so let's move on and
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
692

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
692
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
and this bill is relative to utility
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
companies adopting Advanced meters the
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced was quite complex and
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
potentially cost ly so representative
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
McGee has come up with a an amendment
 
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.349 align:start position:0%
McGee has come up with a an amendment
and

01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
U I'm going to pass out this amendment
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
here and then I'm going to turn the
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
floor over to representative McGee to
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
yours thank you Mr
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
chairman okay so
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
um the impetus of the bill is a is
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
another stab at the Apple from a bill we
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
put in last year um to try and get
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
at um having a plan around when we would
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
have advanced meter technology available
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh which will be enabling other
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
functionality that we're hoping to have
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire sometime
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the near future
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
um but what ended up happening is there
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
were a significant significant amount of
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
detail in the bill in terms of how um
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
meter adoption would occur who would be
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying for what portions
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
of that adoption and so it it's thought
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
to be you know extremely detailed and uh
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
in speaking with eversource about that
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
approach um it was really a non-starter
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
from their
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
perspective uh rather than have yet
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
another year roll off the calendar
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
without us making any effort uh to
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
secure additional information that's
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
basically needed by the state to support
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
other policies that we're entertaining
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
on this committee I uh pulled back
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh the direction of the bill so that
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
what it does at this point after the the
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
findings um I um put a new section two
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
starting at um line 19 access to
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
interval Advanced meter functionality
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
into it and
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh put in a section that says
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
that the electric distribution utilities
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
under commission jurisdiction that have
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
not implemented or not in the Pro
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
process of implementing interval and
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
advanced meter functionality capability
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh oh capable of reporting hourly
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
consumption or exports to the grid for
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
all or most of the distribution
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
companies for use and load settlement um
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
provide us with a report on their
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
compliance with the firk order
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
2222 uh by November of this year and
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
that is simply to help us get a sense of
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
since there is a federal order um
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
concerning grid
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
modernization and utilities um providing
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
additional functionality to support
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources being added
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
to the system in a you know a systemic
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
way that all utilities have to um move
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
towards that or or uh provide some
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
planning in in terms of compliance with
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
that order and so I think we should be
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
able to be privy um to that information
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
to help us support the bills that we're
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
going to be writing for the following
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
year so November 1st is the deadline and
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
it's basically a report to this
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
committee and to the uh Senate energy
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
committee as
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you for that explanation
 
01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you for that explanation
representative

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair so uh when
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
we had testimony on the original Bill
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
basically every utility had a problem
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
with it and every utility reported that
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
they Le best of my recollection had
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
plans for when they were going to
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
actually Implement uh you know uh time
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
of use meters and and and whatnot um so
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
are those plans that we heard earlier
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
not adequate for compliance with FK
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
2222 thanks for the question um I don't
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
think every uh utility had a problem
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the bill uh because I know unitel
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
already has Ami meters um and the co-op
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
already has Ami meters so in terms of um
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated data coming from the
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
meters it's not all utilities and uh we
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
have vague uh information about 5 years
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
out maybe eight years out for our our
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
largest eversource our largest um
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
utility company being able to um get to
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
the point where after there other
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
customers in the New England region
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
they've got plans I guess but they
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
haven't shared with us what those plans
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
are so in terms of an ETA it is a bit
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
vague and in terms of the federal
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
pressure uh to up upgrade um the
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
technology infrastructure in order to
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
enable uh wider scale adoption of local
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable sources
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how those two things go
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
together but I think that it we it we
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
legitimately should be able to ask and
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
get that answered that's what the bill
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
do so what would we then do with that
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
answer what would you prop propose to do
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
answer well I think if we had uh greater
 
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
information about the intention
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
for for example the push back that we
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
get currently with some of the things
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
that we've asked to have happened are
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
that backend system upgrades the
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
technology on the backend systems which
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
in some cases are disjointed um and
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
older uh that's a a large scale
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
investment not going to happen anytime
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
soon but it's an inhibitor because it's
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a technical component of
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
being able to move to a place where we
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
can actually do the reconciliation on
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
the bills and do the kind of load
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
settlement you know
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
sophisticated um
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
billing and um so we don't have any
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
insights into that they're private
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
company they're doing their thing but as
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
a state I actually think we've been
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
asking for a while to say okay you have
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
these roadblocks that you're saying are
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
insurmountable but you must have a plan
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
because we're not the only government
 
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.709 align:start position:0%
because we're not the only government
entity

01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
that is applying pressure saying we need
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
answers we need to know how many years
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
is it going to be at what point are all
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
the technologies that required going to
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
be there are we looking
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
at are we looking at having all the
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
meters replaced in a five-year time
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
frame but still not having the billing
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
capability at that point and then that
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
project going from there we don't know
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
so we don't know what the answer is and
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
that means we don't know how many years
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to take for our our largest
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
utility to be able to provide um the
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
technical capabilities that are required
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
in a modern system and since the federal
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
government is requiring utilities to do
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
that I think we should we should ask to
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
be privy to the response of you know any
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
company that doesn't already have Ami
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
meters as to what what what their
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
responses are to the federal government
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
on that in that
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
cuz they're also asking
 
01:17:27.239 --> 01:17:28.750 align:start position:0%
cuz they're also asking
for

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
um they're also asking for the backend
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh capabilities not just the meter which
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
is basically uh the way you get the
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
information but also the processing of
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
the information so all of the things
 
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
that are preventing us from moving
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
forward with more sophisticated energy
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
transactions is are also covered by that
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
2222 um 2222
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
order which I have here if anybody's
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
interested in looking at it but um yeah
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just requiring that we
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
enable distributed energy resources to
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
come alongside traditional
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
resources um so that Reg Regional
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
organized wholesale markets can actually
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
H have a a systemic way of accounting
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
for those resources which right now it's
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
all peac meal and the federal government
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
is saying they're here to stay um and so
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to um streamline this
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
hard so would you be happy if the
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
November 1st report November 1st 2025
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
report said see our next integrated
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
plan uh I'm not I'm not aware if the
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution resource plan
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
includes um
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
um includes a the planning for the
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
upgrade of the backend
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
systems I I'm not aware of
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
that okay representative
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah a couple of things first
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with us getting a copy
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the report but I did have a couple of
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
questions uh it says for all for
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities under
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
commission jurisdiction my understanding
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
was that this order only applied to uh
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
eversource because of size that say unit
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
until and Liberty were exempt because
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
they're smaller someone have to clear
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
that part up but my my major concern is
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do everything with the
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
law laws cost money this would have to
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
be go through the process voted on in
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
the house go to the Senate have hearings
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the Senate it's passes there then
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to the governor uh I
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming and I don't want to speak
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
for ever Source but I I'm assuming if we
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
said hey send us a copy of this report
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
will you that they would willingly send
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
us the copy of report without having the
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
power of of law behind it
 
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea but I don't think we
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
need a law to make it
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
work well let's ask eversource see what
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
they think um since they are here and
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
have a copy of this amendment let's see
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
what they think of this
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
amendment good morning Mr Lata thank you
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
for being here good morning uh Michael
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
Lata representing ever Source energy uh
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
we we did receive a copy of the amend
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
this morning and are uh sort of still
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
digesting I think we have a few concerns
 
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
with it uh the first is starting on line
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
seven uh section
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
two I guess we just disagree and believe
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
that that's not an accurate statement
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
that utilities uh do not accurately uh
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
settle load um as I testified to on
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
other bills uh that we do accurately
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
settle load today the contributions and
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
load reductions of uh a variety of of
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies are captured and shared and
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
any benefits of them are shared by all
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
customers um we also don't believe that
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
the current uh uh structure prohibits
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
demand lowering management by individual
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
customers uh there are a number of uh
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
demand response and de demand lowering
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh programs Place offered by all the
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
utilities uh so we we feel that those
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
aren't accurate
 
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.629 align:start position:0%
aren't accurate
statements

01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
statements
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
um I guess what's being sort of tied
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
together here is um FK order
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
2222 and uh load
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
settlement uh and some presumed changes
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
or desired changes to the load
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
settlement process so um right now
 
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
Utilities in New Hampshire and I think
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority in New England
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they have
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
advanced metering Ami metering do not
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
use that hourly or five minute output in
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
terms of settling load they use what's
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
known as load shapes which are estimated
 
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
loads based upon the character of the
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
service um and so this bill seems to
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
intermingle those two issues so as uh
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGee spoke about FK
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
order 2222 what that really does the
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
goal of that is to allow aggregations of
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
small distributed energy resources to
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the wholesale markets
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
that is a different issue than load
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
settlement and I understand that there
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
is you know one entity in the state of
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that has expressed
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
concerns and wants radical changes to
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
how all utilities settle load this seems
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be an intermingling of those two two
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
issues and so if I look at this
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement I've actually not
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
seen a b usually the bill requires you
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
know a state agency the department of
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
energy the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh to submit reports to the legislature
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is asking the actual investor owned
 
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.550 align:start position:0%
this is asking the actual investor owned
uh

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
utilities uh to do so uh which is I'm
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
sure there are other examples of that
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
but a little bit unusual um here if I'm
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly um it would apply
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
to all utilities in New Hampshire I
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
believe because again uh even those that
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't have uh that do have Ami metering
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
I don't believe use those for load
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
settlement and so uh it's asking for the
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
utilities to report on compliance with
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
FK order
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
have the either don't have the inter
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
interval metering or Advanced metering
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
capable of allowing consumption uh for
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
all or most of their distribution
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
customers for use in load settlement um
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
again it's sort of tying together a
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
number of of different issues I'd also
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
point out there's been a lot of
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about per order
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
2022 um that this is actively being
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
worked on uh at the regional level and
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
actually all the different isos how to
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
actually implement this and the
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
implementation uh sort of requirement
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
for the utilities uh is in November of
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
20126 so this would essentially ask us
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
to report on an active ongoing Regional
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and I note
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
that lots of parties uh lots of
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
different entities uh are a party to
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
those conver ations uh if there is an
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
entity in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
that has questions or wants to shape how
 
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
that is implemented they have every
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so uh instead of
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
coming to the New Hampshire legislature
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
and trying to change the law here to to
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
force issues when again it's very much
 
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
in flux there are regular meetings of
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
the iso metering group that are working
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
on this um so I I guess those are just
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
initial thoughts thoughts um uh with
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
this this is this is different than
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
asking the utilities you know what their
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
integration so if we were to pass this
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation just a
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
theoretical what kind of report do you
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
think your utility would be required to
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
come up
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
with so I don't know where on November
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
1st of this year the regional
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
implementation process for for order
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
2022 would be I imagine it would
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
be just a brief update on where those
 
01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.390 align:start position:0%
be just a brief update on where those
discussions

01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
stand so following the normal course of
 
01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.950 align:start position:0%
stand so following the normal course of
legislative

01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
action if this bill passed this
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
committee or this amendment passed this
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
committee then went to the Senate
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
and the Senate agreed with it then it
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
went to the governor and she eventually
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
signed it and it took effect 60 days
 
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
after its Passage would there be enough
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
time that would take us into probably
 
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
August or maybe September would that
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
give you enough time to prepare a report
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
by November
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
1st I I imag I think the timeline in the
 
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
bill is is a fair point and I imagine it
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
would be a rather brief report for a
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
number of reasons the the just if I
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
point out just one more thing on the
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
finding section what we've seen is um I
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
I just urge the committee not to take
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
those words lightly um if you put this
 
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.590 align:start position:0%
those words lightly um if you put this
into

01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
statute these get these findings these
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
purpose statements they show up at the
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission uh different
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
entities bring them forth and use them
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
to advance their um their individual
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
goals and so you're telling the Public
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission of the State of New
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the legislature has
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed the way that utilities
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
currently settle load and are
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with it and would like to
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
fundamentally shift that presumably you
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
know you're comfortable with costs
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
associated with that and so we see that
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
these these you know people say ah
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
finding section that doesn't carry the
 
01:28:03.149 --> 01:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
weight of law you know it's okay it's
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
just sort of a a a statement we we do
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
find that parties very much point to
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
this and uh it is in effect the
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
legislature telling the regulator
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory body what they desire as an
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
outcome so I I just urge you to really
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
consider whether you have a full
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of how load settlement
 
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
occurs today and how you would like to
 
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
changed representative McGee thank you
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Lata I think
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's a fair point um on the finding
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
section um and I guess you know you and
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
I have had discussions we discussed this
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
specific bill um and what I continually
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
have tried to get at the chairman
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier whether when the
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning is done at
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission whether
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
there is an answer in terms of
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
planning when New Hampshire is going to
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
have when when ever source is going to
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
have the backend technical
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure when are they planning to
 
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
upgrade their backend technical
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
support stuff it doesn't support today
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of energy transactions and
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
and also uh on the meters you know we
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for either of those
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
things and they're high level things and
 
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's really what what I'm trying to
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
figure out is what is the time frame for
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be able to
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
move um to really enabling a competitive
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
market and that that is something that
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
is of concern to this committee so every
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
time that issue comes up we don't get
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
any kind of an answer that there's no
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
plans that you know you need to do plans
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
so to the chair's question when you file
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
an integrated resource plan at the
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission do you have
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
dates in there for a project plan that
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
is going to work on backend systems and
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
also the migration of the current meter
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
system so I I appreciate the question
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
and and I disagree that um we haven't
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
been forthright and provided in
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
information both to the legislature as
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
well as our Regulators on uh a a
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
timeline around Ami
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
transition um as we previously
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
discussed uh we did hire a third-party
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
consultant who specializes in this area
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
and and has worked in other just
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions on um the conversion from
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh AMR metering to Ami metering uh they
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
conducted what is was termed an Ami
 
01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
feasibility study obviously we know it's
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's quite feasible it was really a cost
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
and benefit um analysis and it was a
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
cost and benefit analysis that looked at
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
this specific issue what is the optimal
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
time what is the optimal time frame for
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
eversource in New Hampshire PSNH to
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
transition from AMR meters to Ami meters
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
and what that that uh study which was
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
over 100 pages long was delivered to our
 
01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
over 100 pages long was delivered to our
reg

01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
reg
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
Regulators both the department of energy
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
as well as the Public Utilities
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
Commission and you know I I know others
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
have referenced it and so they're
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
certainly aware of it and have reviewed
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
it uh showed that the the optimal time
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
is to begin that transition in
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
2030 uh in terms of replacement of our
 
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
systems in terms of where uh the
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
existing AMR
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh meters would be towards the end of
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
their useful life to limit uh the the
 
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
stranded cost Associated and I will
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
point out as well um we were asked to
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
run a scenario or the third party
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
consultant was asked to run a scenario
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh because I know we have been
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
criticized for installing AMR meters and
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
not going straight to Ami said well
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
assume you never installed any AMR
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
meters that you had the old radial that
 
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh meters that someone had to walk up um
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it did not show a significant uh
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
savings on the timeline or or really uh
 
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
moving that much faster so uh so that
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
has been delivered that is a document
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that that folks have um we did not
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
include uh sort of this this planned
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
change over to to Ami in this most
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
recent rate case that's currently
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
pending again out of consideration for
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
cost and wanting to focus on that that
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful planned optimized scenario
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the other piece of the question is
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
the other part that would be needed
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be the backend systems that seem
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be so so an issue yes so that
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
um uh that study included the entirety
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the universe of systems at ever
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
source that need to be changed and
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
converted to enable the implementation
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
of Ami from our our communication
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
Network to our meter data management
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
system to the billing systems the the
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
entirety of it so to be just to clarify
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that the
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
optimal time frame to begin the project
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
is five years from now and that's for
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
all of it there's not going to be
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
anything done in the interim for the
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
backend systems or it's all going to be
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
done at the same time and how long will
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
it take to complete do you know that
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
sure I'd be happy to provide a a copy of
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
the report um um I don't really want to
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
read a 100 Pages uh fair fair fair
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
enough I am sure that there
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
are um there is work that will be done
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
in preparation you just don't sort of
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
flip a switch um there are rfps we have
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
to put out there are are different
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
vendors we need to select um but I
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe the beginning of the conversion
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
including the the the uh back office
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
systems the uh uh Building Systems uh
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
2030 okay thank you very much I
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh giving those giving us
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
those clarifying comments as the
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
facilitator of this work session I'm
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
going to move along because we need to
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
be ready
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
to uh adjourn the work session at 11:30
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
so that we can have respective caucus
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
meetings before lunch so let's move now
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
to a discussion of the next bill on the
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
schedule which is House Bill 759 FN
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
relative to community energy
 
01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.070 align:start position:0%
relative to community energy
generators

01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
generators
 
01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
and there is no proposed amendment at
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
the moment for this bill so we're
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill as
 
01:35:17.159 --> 01:35:19.430 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill as
introduced

01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
and I want to express that I have a
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
serious concern
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
about the definition of community
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
generator which starts on line three of
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
introduced the definition definition of
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
community generator on line three see
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
says Community generator means a
 
01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:45.870 align:start position:0%
says Community generator means a
customer

01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
customer
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
generator and then goes on from there so
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
that raises the question does a
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
same is it treated the same as a
 
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.709 align:start position:0%
same is it treated the same as a
customer

01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
customer
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
generator so for example would a
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
community generator be able to net meter
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
the way a customer generator
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
can because the definition definition
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
goes on to say
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the capacity at the point of
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection with the distribution
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
grid can be up to 5
 
01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt and that's a
 
01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.790 align:start position:0%
megawatt and that's a
substantial

01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
expansion of a definition of some entity
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
that could potentially net
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
meter and even if it wasn't net
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
metering the fact that there
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
are probably 60 to 70 Community
 
01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.149 align:start position:0%
are probably 60 to 70 Community
aggregation

01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
communities in the state today could
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
potentially expose the state to an
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
increase in distributed energy projects
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
of about 325 to 350 megawatts which is a
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
lot and as FK has been telling us or
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
nerk rather has been telling us for the
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
last three years in a row the
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
proliferation proliferation
 
01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.910 align:start position:0%
proliferation proliferation
proliferation

01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
proliferation
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
apologies of distributed energy
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
resources is one of the Prime reasons
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
why our grid is becoming less and less
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
dependable and
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
reliable so I'm finding it very
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to um see
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
that this nit bill would be useful to
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
the state at this point in time it has
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
lines 14 and 15 it talks about rate
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
maximum rated export
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
capacity and the question was asked at
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
the public hearing does that mean the
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
same thing as name plate and if not why
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
has that change been made or if so why
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
has that change been
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
made there was also some question about
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh the text on line page two on line
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
nine about line loss adjustments being
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
assumed to be 1/ half of the utility
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
published distribution system line
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
losses which seems arbitrary and would
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
seem to beg for a line loss
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
study this whole bill would seem to
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
be an effort to bypass ISO wholesale
 
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.589 align:start position:0%
be an effort to bypass ISO wholesale
Market

01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and this topic is currently
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
being debated before the Pu so this bill
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
I think has many many flaws and while I
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
understand that the community aggreg
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
ators would like to see
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh some movement
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
on a definition of something similar to
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
a community generator we had this bill a
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last year I don't think
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill cuts the mustard for this year
 
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
and that's my assessment and I'm anxious
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
to hear what other people have to say
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I actually have an amendment
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
here that addresses some of the concerns
 
01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
you just raised uh it
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
restores the original language that was
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
that was struck from section two about
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
total Peak generating capacity and
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
removes the part about maximum rated
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
export capacity at the point of interne
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
with the distribution grid so it just
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
restores that language that was there
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
and also it deletes section four about
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
um the line loss adjustments it does not
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
address your concern in section one but
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to pass it out out the other
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
thing that I would suggest is that we
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
invite um Mr Belo and Miss uh Dennis uh
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
to join us because they're very familiar
 
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
with this bill and may be able to
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
discuss some of your
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you further discussion
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah I'd just like
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
to add I know you and I had the
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
conversation about uh whether or not
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's um it's confusing to the issue to
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
have a customer generator as well as a
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
community generator so I went back and
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
made myself more familiar with this bill
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
which I wasn't really very familiar with
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think it's an attempt to
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that there are generators who
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
are aggregating and generators who are
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
acting to uh create supply for
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities that need to be
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
distinguished from customer generators
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
cuz customer generator is a category
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
that that covers the smaller and this is
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is its own category so I think it
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
clarifies um Us in statute to be able to
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
in our Mind's Eye when we're in front of
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
the Pu or when we're in these hearings
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
to distinguish what a community
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
generator is which is a larger entity uh
 
01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
that is actually supplying a different
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
benefit right they're um they will have
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
interconnections which is something that
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
all customer generators don't have to do
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh and you know so there's a and they
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
and they'll be reducing load in a more
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
significant way so I think I think I
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that about your
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about whether it is confusing
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
to have a new category I think the the
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
reason for the new category is pretty
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
well Justified we have different types
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
of people doing different types of
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
projects and they're not and if we call
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
them all customer gener generators then
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
it is more confusing for us to
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
understand what what scale we're talking
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
about in my
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
opinion well thank you for your opinion
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
that um this amendment does address as
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
representative Corman said some of my
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
concerns but my biggest concern is the
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
statement that a community uh generator
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
can produce up to five megawatts that's
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
that's a huge expansion uh of
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resource deployment
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that's just too much further
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative migy yeah on
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
that point I know it's a utility project
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
but the the um project that Unitil is
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
doing in
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
Kingston um wouldn't that qualify as a
 
01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
community generator project up to 5
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
megawatts I I mean I think people are
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
looking to do these projects so
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
I'm um
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
qualify okay no that's true
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah I'm still
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
kind of bouncing through these and all
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
the terminologies and everything but
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Community General
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
and we have the let me start with this
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
the the uh the representative corman's
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment changes paragraph 2B but not
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
2G is that correct okay
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
um so there seems to be some confusion
 
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
because in 2B in the proposed new
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment says eligible customer
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
generator a a customer generator means
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
an electric blah blah blah up to
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
including one megawatt except for a
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
municiple host and then in 2G it talks
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
about it there's no one megawatt it's
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
just up to five and only for the load
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
being used for a municipal or County
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
aggregation and I thought the net
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
metering stand allowed up to five for
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
municipal or County use not a no one
 
01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
else but those so I'm a little confused
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
here what's going on maybe someone can
 
01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.430 align:start position:0%
here what's going on maybe someone can
enlighten

01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
enlighten
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
point Mr Belo would you like to
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
clarify uh what you intended when you
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
um as provided in the bill last year
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
that passed uh unanimously from this
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee um it does put the municipal
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
or I should say community generator
 
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
within the net metering framework so by
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
saying it is a customer generator it's
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
saying this is within the net metering
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
construct um there's no jurisdictional
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
issue of concern about uh the net
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
metering construct what this is is an
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
alternative to the municipal host
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
construct which is up to but under 5
 
01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
construct which is up to but under 5
megaw

01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
megaw
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
um in which as a practical matter all
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
those projects have relied upon uh the
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
income from the distribution utility uh
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
as being compensated under the net
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
metering terms of the utility this would
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
and and they's concerned about the cost
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
shifting or issues around uh these
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
projects between one and 5 megawatts uh
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the utility is providing all the
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
compensation for in this case in the
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
construct of a community generator they
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
would not be participating in net
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
metering with the distribution utility
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
so there wouldn't be compensation for
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
their energy or capacity from the
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
utility but rather that would have to
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
come from uh the uh entity that they're
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
a customer of either a community power
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
aggregation or competitive supplier um
 
01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:23.719 align:start position:0%
so in that sense it's it's a it's an
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
alternative to the municipal house
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
construct which is up to 5 megawatts I I
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
think that's the main point and it
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve the utility paying them
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh the default service rate um so
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh and it just it it's simply you know
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
for instance in the case of the city of
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
Lebanon we just want to be able to use
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
the output from our landfill gas project
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
which is base load so it's 247 almost
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
year round uh as a great resource rather
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
than selling the power to Liberty
 
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
Utilities we' just like to be able to
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
use it uh for Lebanon Community power um
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of that
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
simple I guess I'll stop there see if
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's other questions that I can help
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
with okay so you're saying
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
that when we created the municipal host
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
legislation part of the impetus for that
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
was to provide savings for
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh are you saying that this
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
community generation because it only
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
serves a community aggregation would
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
also provide savings for
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um well yes if as long as the
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh wants to buy their power
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the community power and if they
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
believe that or if it is a better deal
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
than the utility any One customer is
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
still free to switch back to the utility
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
so these projects would have to be
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
vetted um and sort of judiciously
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
undertaken to ensure that they're uh uh
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
financially reasonable and sustainable
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
on a long-term
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
basis but because the utility
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't own the generation
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
facility um as it might under a
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
municipal host situation uh wouldn't
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers not get any return from this
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
well well the utilities don't own
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal host projects um those are all
 
01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
privately developed if I said utilities
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
I meant municipalities oh um well yes so
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon would benefit by having a uh a
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
reliable Revenue stream for that project
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
for instance rather than just
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
speculating on what default Service
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
rates might be over the next 10 or 20
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
years and that would translate into
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
savings for taxpayers yes okay thank
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington yeah it's
 
01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
so many terms here it gets a little
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
confusing what is it that's not in the
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
law or is in the law that prevents this
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
from happening now what what's the
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
what's the roadblock that we're trying
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
around um well first of all uh there's
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
no uh provision um that a com a
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
competitive electric power supplier or
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation could be a
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
direct off-taker of anything uh over one
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
megawatt in
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
size I mean I thought municipals were up
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
to five up to but under the municipal
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
host construct which which is the the
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
participants in that group are not
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
off-takers they don't get credit for the
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
power supply all they get is a financial
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
credit which which is sort of the
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
difference between what the developer
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
needs to make the project pencil and
 
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
what they can get in revenue from the
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
utility default service um we do not
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we would pay as much as
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
the utility pays uh for just the energy
 
01:49:52.119 --> 01:49:53.149 align:start position:0%
the utility pays uh for just the energy
component

01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh the equivalent of our default Service
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh but what we can offer is a longterm a
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
longer term uh uh more reliable uh rate
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
structure which works to the advantage
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
of developers because they have better
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
financing options follow up yes follow
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
and so what needs to be what's what's
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
preventing you from doing this right now
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to determine well
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
the you can only do it as a municipal
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
host okay and you're not an off-taker
 
01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of a a financial Kickback
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
to the accounts that sign up to get a
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
credit uh for the project but these the
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
second amendment that came out here the
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
newest one uh that basically says up to
 
01:50:39.629 --> 01:50:39.639 align:start position:0%
five for a municipal house but up to one
 
01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
for everybody else no um
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
because the it says what it does which
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
is in the current law uh says um it's
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
limited up to and including one me
 
01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.149 align:start position:0%
limited up to and including one me
megawatt

01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
um except as provided for municipal host
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
and for Community generator so if you
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
look at the municipal host definition in
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
the statute it's very similar to the
 
01:51:05.709 --> 01:51:05.719 align:start position:0%
definition for community
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
generator except for this structure
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
where you're not a direct off-taker it
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide for direct oftaking of
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
the power except really by the default
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh by the uh distribution utility so in
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
the definition of community generator
 
01:51:21.629 --> 01:51:21.639 align:start position:0%
which would remain as part of the bill
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
it allows that a commun Community
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
generator could be up to but not you
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
know under under 5 megaw and a community
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
generator is not necessarily owned by
 
01:51:30.079 --> 01:51:30.709 align:start position:0%
generator is not necessarily owned by
the

01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
municipality correct correct so that's
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so that would seem to uh violate
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
the spirit of Municipal host then if uh
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
the municipality is not involved in
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
the ownership of the deer well they
 
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
could be involved in the ownership under
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal host they don't have to own it
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
either they can just contract for it
 
01:52:00.069 --> 01:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
Municipal host projects are mostly being
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
developed uh not by municipalities but
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
by private developers or its existing
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
hydros between one and 5 megawatts that
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
are owned by for-profit corporations
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
that are converting to Municipal host
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
status and getting paid by the utility
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
at the default service
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
rate okay representative McGee thank you
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Belo for being
 
01:52:24.669 --> 01:52:24.679 align:start position:0%
with us again and enlightening us as you
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
always do um I'm looking at some of the
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
notes from the hearing on this bill and
 
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
I know when clean energy New Hampshire
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
testified um Sam Evans Brown had called
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
it an elegant solution to the problem of
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
aggregation and I think he was referring
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
in his answer to the fact that the
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
concern of cost
 
01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
shifting um that has come up in this
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
committee so many times was something
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
that was solved here so can you say a
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
little bit about that because if it's a
 
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
benefit to communities to have more of
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
these projects to lower costs but it
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
also doesn't involve cost shifting then
 
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
I think we need to make that
 
01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.510 align:start position:0%
I think we need to make that
clear

01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
right um so part of the definition um
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
that remains in the bill under section
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
one of the bill uh still provides that
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
uses its excess generation to offset the
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
load obligation of a municipal or County
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
aggregation or a competitive electricity
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
supplier insight the two rsas under
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
which they exist um and
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh and obviously any of the load uh that
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
is being offset has to be in the same
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utility service
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
territory very much parallel language to
 
01:53:43.069 --> 01:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
the municipal host construct um except
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
the difference is to enable this to be a
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
direct off-taker uh the the competitive
 
01:53:51.629 --> 01:53:51.639 align:start position:0%
power supplier or the CPA um so what
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
that means is that this bill does not
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know would create an opportunity
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that is outside of the project being
 
01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
signed up for net metering with the
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
distribution utility instead signing up
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
for net metering with the competitive
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
power supplier or uh the CPA and one of
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
the things that's really important to
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand is for Liberty and Unitil is
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
there W won't be an opportunity for
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
smaller deers to participate the iso New
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
England Market because they're not
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
required to enable that um so that's not
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
really an option either at at at a
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
certain smaller scale
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
the uh project 4.9 megawatt project that
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
Unitil is doing in their case at the
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
Pu they pointed out that there are
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities for many additional
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
similar size projects that produce net
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
value for New Hampshire rate payers net
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
positive value eversource in their
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
current distribution rate cases said
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're looking to do a number of these
 
01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
projects under 5 megawatts functioning
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
as load reducers that they want to
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
invest in because they believe it can
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
produce net savings for New Hampshire
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
residents so the question is why are we
 
01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
enabling the distribution Monopoly to
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
develop these projects but not in
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
enabling other parties to develop them
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
manner okay quickly please thank you but
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
well the last question goes back to
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
something that the chair had mentioned
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
earlier was the perception that having
 
01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
more of these projects might make us
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
more brittle or less uh stable and I I I
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
think you're as close to a subject
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
matter expert as we have so perhaps you
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
could speak to that concern um well sure
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
um as a couple of recent affer
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners former chairman
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh wellinghoff and um um oh no I'm
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
blanking on his name um
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
pardon no the one who is a chief of
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
staff for uh um uh speaker uh not Mr
 
01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.629 align:start position:0%
staff for uh um uh speaker uh not Mr
McConnell

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
McConnell
 
01:56:09.639 --> 01:56:11.470 align:start position:0%
McConnell
um

01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
um um doesn't matter go on a republican
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
former chair recent chair of for will
 
01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:19.719 align:start position:0%
allow it cliff and a Democrat yeah
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
getting old um they jointly put out an
 
01:56:25.629 --> 01:56:25.639 align:start position:0%
article saying there should be
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for better enabling
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources because
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
they can be developed quickly and
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
particularly if we enable storage to go
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
with them they can be much more reliable
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of their production which was
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
the intent of the maximum rated export
 
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
capacity but that's being taken out but
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
I will just say that language came right
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
out of the model de interconnection
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
standards by Iraq and has been a sort of
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
a topic of discussion at the doe but
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
they basically says well we can't
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
consider anything other than maximum
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
rated output because um because of it's
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
in the law so setting that aside though
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
the concept which still can exist um
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
because the problem is when you add
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
storage it also has a rated out export
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
capacity but its purpose is to help clip
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
for instance in a solar project store
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
some of that power that's being produced
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
at around solar noon and Export it in
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
the evening when it's more valuable and
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
for a competitive power supplier or CPA
 
01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
would be evaluating the production
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
profile and wouldn't want to buy
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
something that's just producing power
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
when it's least valuable around solar
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
noon so I think this would drive
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
projects that are more optimal
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
investments just like Unitil argued um
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the CA in their case because it's
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's a better investment because it is
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
designed um with these temporal values
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh in consideration which is I think
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
what would occur with this okay now
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're going a little off uh course but
 
01:57:58.750 --> 01:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
um one quick question can't the city of
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
Lebanon just sign a PPA with uh or the
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
can't the community power corporations
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
just sound a PPA with the city of
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon to buy that
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
gas um or electricity
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
um right it could but we couldn't
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
compensate them for it because we get no
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
credit for those exports we pay P the
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
exact same amount money for our power
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
supply with or without it so so there's
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
no rational basis for us to compensate
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
them the utilities can compensate them
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
because by law they're allowed to
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
recover that and they recovered it
 
01:58:39.629 --> 01:58:39.639 align:start position:0%
recover that cost by putting it in their
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge we we
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
01:58:45.709 --> 01:58:45.719 align:start position:0%
option okay all right we've got to move
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
on because if we're going to get done um
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've got quite a few more bills to
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
discuss thank you I appreciate that
 
01:58:51.599 --> 01:58:54.430 align:start position:0%
discuss thank you I appreciate that
clarification

01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
so let's move on next to House Bill
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
storage so this bill according to the
 
01:59:17.199 --> 01:59:18.310 align:start position:0%
storage so this bill according to the
prime

01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor who was representative Corman
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
simply allows
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh net
 
01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
metered generation to be time shifted
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
instead of putting it on the grid as
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's created by your solar panels you
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
can put instead you can put the the
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
energy into a battery and then put it on
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
later uh from your battery so it's it's
 
01:59:53.229 --> 01:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
simply according to the bill allows
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh a shift of when you put the net
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
metered power onto the
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
grid however the doe had
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
some structural concerns about the build
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
they say it needs changes to the net
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
metering statute to make this
 
02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:14.189 align:start position:0%
metering statute to make this
work

02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
um so there seem to be some concerns
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
about whether this will work or
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
not so I'm
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's anything else we
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
here representative Corman yeah I do
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
have an amendment a very simple
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that um it just deletes
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
section three leaves the rest Alone um
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
so that uh I mean the commission already
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
apparently has that Authority and uh
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay so the rest of the bill
 
02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be just the same that's
 
02:01:07.069 --> 02:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right well we'll do
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
deal with that at executive session
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
755 this is a big monolithic bill that
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
Parts the DOA said that there are open
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
dockets before the puc that cover many
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
of the topics implemented by this bill
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
and that there are cost shifting
 
02:01:37.069 --> 02:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
concerns Unitil opposed the
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill it was concerned about cost being
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
an issue because of system integration
 
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
expenses they wanted to wait for the
 
02:01:50.109 --> 02:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing pu dockets and they also
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
expressed a concern about cost shifting
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
the Electric Co-op opposed the bill due
 
02:01:55.639 --> 02:01:56.470 align:start position:0%
the Electric Co-op opposed the bill due
to

02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:00.069 --> 02:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
costs they testified that they tried to
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
implement a transactive Energy System
 
02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
and failed and had to drop the
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
project and they also testified that
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
people don't seem to be all that
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
interested in time of use rates
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
eversource opposed the bill because it
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically changes load settlement to
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
benefit one group uh at Great cost to
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
others and it's a major change change to
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
definitions uh so there were
 
02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
significant objections to this
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
um it being so large and making so many
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
changes uh it just doesn't seem to me
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward with a a
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
monolithic Bill like this other reaction
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yes thank you Mr
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
chair um well I understand that the bill
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
is ambitious in terms of the scope of
 
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
what it covers um I on Friday we
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
received a notice from the Public
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that uh one of the
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
dockets I believe it was de
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
22060 that was to
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
cover um forward-looking aspects of the
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
distributed utilities compensation for
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
de and the net metering tariff all
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
things that we've been waiting for and
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
now that docket started three years ago
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
but there was also the VD uh which took
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
five years before that to answer some of
 
02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
these questions um we got an order uh
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
that said that the docket was going to
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
be basically dissolved and put into an
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
investigative uh status which does not
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
require any any output so we we don't
 
02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
have any further understanding of
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether a decision is ever going to come
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
out on those ending pieces
 
02:03:58.510 --> 02:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
um of the adjudicative proceedings so I
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
guess the I I do understand
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
that uh folks in the competitive market
 
02:04:09.629 --> 02:04:09.639 align:start position:0%
who are you know most amply represented
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
I guess by the community power Coalition
 
02:04:13.870 --> 02:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
because they've you know they've taken
 
02:04:17.069 --> 02:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
what we did in in hb35 and run with it
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to you know become actual
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
competitors um
 
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
they have helped with some of the uh
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation this year in terms of
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
understanding the nuances that we do not
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
in trying to get those things
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
represented in statutory language while
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
I understand that this particular one is
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
about reforming the market and it covers
 
02:04:44.830 --> 02:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of items that are um that we we
 
02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the answers to them I don't
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
think it's a I think the appropriate
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
thing for us to do would be to take this
 
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
to a study commit comme because at this
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
point uh we are we don't have any
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
answers coming from the Public Utilities
 
02:05:01.629 --> 02:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
Commission and we keep sort of punting
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
it back and forth you know it's chicken
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
and egg oh well they're doing it so we
 
02:05:06.430 --> 02:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it and they're not
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
doing it so I I think we do have a
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility to try and figure this
 
02:05:14.189 --> 02:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
out and try and take whatever steps we
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
can to prevent further delay in anything
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we can um implement or or at least
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
understand better as a committee in
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
terms of bills for next year because
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
time is going by like I said we've we
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand the value of
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
distributed energy everyone was waiting
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I remember when we were putting off
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
Legislation during that period saying
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
wait until the report comes out and then
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
the report came out and the Pu decided
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
that they're going to look at it again
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
so we had the answers and we didn't you
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
know we didn't use them and then this
 
02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
doc ET uh that was just dissolved on
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
Friday through an order was developed at
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
that point to say that the puc would
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
give us some answers on the tariffs um
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
and on what the valuation should be and
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
on how competitive markets should go
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
forward well they they're still waiting
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anybody actually um
 
02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
giving us the answers so I think maybe
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative Corman thank you
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree this is a a large and
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
ambitious bill um and I can understand
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
reluctance to just charge full steam
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
ahead with it um and I agree with my
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
ranking member that a study committee
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate here so that we can
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
actually really understand the issues
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
out okay representative
 
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah uh going along with the
 
02:06:53.069 --> 02:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
kind of the same thing with a little bit
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
of confusion there's also a major part
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill is uh pursuant to the
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
relevant ISO New England tariffs and
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
procedures that take effect on November
 
02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
1st 2026 we're supposed to do a lot of
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
stuff we don't know what those are yet
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
so I just think it would be rather uh uh
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
not the smartest thing to do to say well
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're telling you go
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
Implement something that we don't know
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
what it is yet because uh I think I
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see that tariff before I
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
I'm advocating not passing the bill at
 
02:07:26.079 --> 02:07:27.270 align:start position:0%
I'm advocating not passing the bill at
least

02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
least
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
so all right see no further discussion
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
on this bill we have one more that we
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
want to talk about a little bit and
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's HB
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
760 uh I know a lot of people have
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of emails about hb7 to 60
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
and um I would just refresh everyone's
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
memory that ever Source opposed
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
this bill due to the ongoing docket at
 
02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:53.669 align:start position:0%
this bill due to the ongoing docket at
the

02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
Pu and
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
it Constellation Energy supported the
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
dock the bill um made a suggestion that
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
on line three the word should should be
 
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
changed to
 
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
shall and
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
um my notes say that there was a
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion that lines 18 and 19 section
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
two which is a
 
02:08:27.549 --> 02:08:27.559 align:start position:0%
repeal be removed from the
 
02:08:27.559 --> 02:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
repeal be removed from the
bill

02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
so there are some open questions about
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
um and I'd be interested to hear if you
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
have anything you'd like to say about it
 
02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:41.870 align:start position:0%
have anything you'd like to say about it
representative

02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I mean uh the concept of
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
the bill I like I think it's a good idea
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
if people get off default service
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're off default service they
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't reap any benefits or penalties
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
based on what default service does if
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're no longer associated with it but
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
we did hear the Pu come out and saying
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
they have an extensive doet which I
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
think is going to be released issued
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
this spring and I just think it would be
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
imprudent on our part to put something
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the statute and then have the Pu come
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
up with some great other position that
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we say well boy that's not such a
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
good idea so I would like to hold the
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill an interim study until we get the
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
Pu ruling out and we can review that but
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
I mean personally they're going to have
 
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
to convince me
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
that this isn't a good idea because
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm coming from right now
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to I'm willing to give him
 
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to I'm willing to give him
that

02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity I think retain sounds like a
 
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable option for this bill
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
retain well retain an interim study can
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
be similar an interim study
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation is actually made in the
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
second year of the
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
banum and um in the first year of the
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
banum retain would be the would it be
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
the preferred Amendment apparently we KN
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
now have a an amendment for HB 760 so
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
let's hear what representative Corman
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
has to say about it thank you uh so this
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
amendment first of all it strikes uh the
 
02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
section two from the original Bill the
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
repeal section so I know there were
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed about that it
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies in several places that we're
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh where we're talking about default
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
service we mean utility default service
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
so the word utility has been added in I
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
think four different places in section
 
02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
one to just clarify we mean utility
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
default service
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
and uh there had been some concern about
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
the uh recovery period being uh no more
 
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
than a year so what this amendment says
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
is that um the period would be as
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
approved by the commission we'll we'll
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
that um and you know one one thing I do
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
want to say about the concept of the
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
bill and and we've discussed this
 
02:11:05.069 --> 02:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
already the idea that if there are under
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
collections which we have a real danger
 
02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
of having given that the Pu is pushing
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
the utilities to go to spot markets so
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
they really could be under
 
02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.709 align:start position:0%
they really could be under
collections

02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
collections
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
that the that should really come out of
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
only the default service customers if
 
02:11:24.119 --> 02:11:25.310 align:start position:0%
only the default service customers if
you're

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
on community power or competitive
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
supplier you should have nothing to do
 
02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:33.559 align:start position:0%
with paying for those under Collections
 
02:11:35.310 --> 02:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
and I say that as someone on default
 
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
service I mean it's you know it means
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
that I may end up paying more um but
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
do thank you for this amendment any uh
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Corman
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Mickey
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
and as I'm glancing at the language does
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
this uh new bolded language actually
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
help us clarify that piece that you just
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
articulated does it does it ensure that
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
we're not uh having folks outside
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
default service paying those charges
 
02:12:10.109 --> 02:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
right well I mean it makes clear that
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
the default service we're talking about
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
is utility default Service uh so in in a
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.199 --> 02:12:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
clarifies

02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
okay anything else representative
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
schneller thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
question is and and I support the bill
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I think the amendment is a good
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
one my question is does this address
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
commercial customers which I think are
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
substantially impacted by underc
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
well I'll defer that to representative
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
Corman um I mean I I don't know how the
 
02:12:55.189 --> 02:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
rates are set so you know this is this
 
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
is outside my realm of expertise right
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:13:03.149 --> 02:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
um talking about the the under
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
collection so I I don't know if there
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
are separate buckets for residential
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
versus commercial in terms of of how the
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
collections are
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
you all
 
02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
right so I think we we've gone through
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
all the bills now that we are going to
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
be executing this afternoon so I think
 
02:13:26.119 --> 02:13:27.390 align:start position:0%
be executing this afternoon so I think
we

02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
can shut down this work session unless
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
anybody has anything else they would
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
like to uh address representative
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah on HB 266 I have a it's
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
a draft amendment that puts in the all
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
the different newest changes this is the
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
updated version I'll be handing it out
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
shortly uh there are some changes on
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
there where uh well I'll let people read
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
it when it gets out I'll have it out in
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
a second
 
02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
so is this an actual Amendment it it's
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment uh this is what's being
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
proposed by the department of energy who
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
proposed the original Bill they've made
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
some changes in it and like I said I'll
 
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
let people read it and then we can
 
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
discuss it I can have it out in about
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
people okay please hand it
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
time all right so we will after we have
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
this a brief discussion about this
 
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB 266 then we will break
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
for uh essentially a an extended lunch
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
break and the Republicans will stay in
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
this room to caucus so everybody else
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
will will need to leave at that point
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
but you don't need to leave until we
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
is there a version headed toward this
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
table this is not this is not going to
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
so this is a this is text that's being
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
proposed for an amendment and you're
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
going to go get it during well if we see
 
02:15:33.790 --> 02:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
what people think of it I'm gon to ask
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the department of
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
energy to explain the changes and then
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh people can ask questions or whatever
 
02:15:41.950 --> 02:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
and if they like it we'll bring it to
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
os does everybody have a copy yet
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
there's not enough okay well I've got
 
02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:49.629 align:start position:0%
there's not enough okay well I've got
more

02:15:49.629 --> 02:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
coming I write the number in on the fill
 
02:15:52.719 --> 02:16:04.270 align:start position:0%
coming I write the number in on the fill
because

02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
on everybody have one now everybody have
 
02:16:10.669 --> 02:16:10.679 align:start position:0%

02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.629 align:start position:0%
 
one

02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:16:22.830 --> 02:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Harrington take
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
us through it again okay so this made
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
some changes to the changes and some of
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
them went put things back the way they
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
were so it's it says at the top the
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
department H Authority investigate any
 
02:16:37.309 --> 02:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
matter related to statute it administers
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
and then it going down to there's no
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
line numbers on this but the end of the
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
first paragraph it says and for the
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of providing instead of
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
complete it just says a record uh by the
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
commission as determined by the depart
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
department so that's that would be a
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
change and there's also the statement is
 
02:16:58.509 --> 02:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
now back in that says and shall have
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
full party status and the right to
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
appeal any adjudicative or non-
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding moving down to
 
02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
section three um the words all necessary
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
are taken out ensure that the department
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
provides support required by so forth so
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
all necessary is taken out down to
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
section four talks about specific
 
02:17:20.429 --> 02:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
answers the department and then gets rid
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
of all the commission may require any
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
public utility um to provide documents
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
and other materials and then again the
 
02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
well on the second to last line of that
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says upon which the
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
department may need information within a
 
02:17:36.429 --> 02:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
time period set by the department so the
 
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
commission was taken out there as well
 
02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to request that the
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department of
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
energy explain why they need these
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
changes Mr
 
02:17:47.549 --> 02:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
young as quickly as possible please
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr CH we also probably should
 
02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
hear from the Pu if they have objections
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
to them as well this is the first time
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
they've seen this do you have a copy Mr
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
SPID you have a copy great thank you Mr
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
Young thank you Mr chairman um again for
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
the record Matt Young attorney for the
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy um
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
right off the bat I'll just point out
 
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
that um just to Super simplify this um
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
this document in front of you the only
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
change that's being made to the bill is
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
introduced is in section
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
two and the only change that's being
 
02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
made in section two is that the language
 
02:18:24.669 --> 02:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
that says we will be um a party to all
 
02:18:26.910 --> 02:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings is being left
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
in that is the only change to the bill
 
02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
is introduced um oh I guess I will say
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's there was language um removed at
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
the at the end there that just would
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
have been needed if we weren't being a
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
party to every proceeding but we are so
 
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
that was taken out as well so there's
 
02:18:43.389 --> 02:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
some high there's a lot of highlights
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
here a lot of bold and cross outs the
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
only change to the bill is introduced is
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
that we are leaving in party tall
 
02:18:49.519 --> 02:18:53.150 align:start position:0%
that we are leaving in party tall
proceedings

02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
hope that helps Mr just add so everyone
 
02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
knows where that is it's line two of
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
section three correct very end of that
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.190 --> 02:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
two okay thank you Mr spidel do you want
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
description yes please do thank you Mr
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
Young could I could I clarify one other
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
aspect before I leave or
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay what is it um so I just wanted to
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
clarify the uh the right to appeal
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
language that was brought up earlier um
 
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
and that that that's in the line three
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
of section
 
02:19:34.750 --> 02:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
two um Mr spidel earlier referenced um
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
you know an instance where it might be
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
an issue where that the two um the doj
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
would appear and uh at the Supreme Court
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
I believe he mentioned the Liberty case
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh that that Liberty did appeal um and
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
the uh doj did represent the department
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
at the Supreme Court the p he was not
 
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
involved in that so I just wanted to
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
kind of clarify that
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
um when any party whether it be the
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
department or utility or the OCA or
 
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
anybody appeals an order from the Pu
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a lawsuit against the Pu it's
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
an appeal of the order the party who is
 
02:20:12.429 --> 02:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
appealing the order would then would
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
obviously argue against the order and
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
the other party who isn't appealing the
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
order would defend that order because
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
they you know benefit in whatever way um
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that was uh
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
crystal clear for the committee um and
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay I don't see any further
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions so now I'll ask Mr spidel to
 
02:20:52.830 --> 02:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
go

02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm I'm not jumping to the
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
conclusion that this is an official
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it has to go through
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative channels but reacting to
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
the language of the commission will rest
 
02:21:09.309 --> 02:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
on the recommendation that this be
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
referred to some kind of study committee
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
we have to get through all this and uh
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
I'd been involved in the commission
 
02:21:19.469 --> 02:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
almost a decade before attorney young
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
had been and I can say that there is a
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
discussion of the chairman of the
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
PC the Department of Justice regarding
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
defensive approaches to defending the
 
02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
order or defending a decision of the
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
commission so the question that's
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
brought up by this bill is how does the
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
02:21:43.469 --> 02:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
react in a
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
scenario where the department of energy
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
is seeking an
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
appeal of a commission decision a
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
commission order
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very weighty question
 
02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
that needs to be considered carefully
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
through a study committee vehicle and so
 
02:22:01.150 --> 02:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
that's what uh I would offer
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
to this Committee in in reaction to this
 
02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
lays language thank you okay thank
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions we'll move on I
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
think we have it all under control at
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
this point so I'm going to bring this
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
work session to a
 
02:22:21.309 --> 02:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
close and ask everyone to vacate the
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
room so that Republicans can
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
caucus I also will ask everyone to
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
return here at 1:00 for an executive
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%

450 which is a bill relative to
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
commercial property assessed clean
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%

Pacer and as the prime sponsor of that
 
04:08:42.349 --> 04:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
bill I move itl and recognize chairman
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman Thomas
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
second moved and seconded that we adopt
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl on House Bill
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
450 the reason we can do this so easily
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
is because we already passed this bill
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
we passed Senate Bill four which was the
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
Senate version of this bill that had a
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
couple of small changes that were
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
improvements to the bill we passed it
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
the house passed it and the governor has
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
already signed the bill so it is now
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
existing law so we no longer need this
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
house bill is there any further
 
04:09:18.000 --> 04:09:21.630 align:start position:0%
house bill is there any further

537 and after discussion at
 
04:16:12.750 --> 04:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
caucus we have decided that I am going

as it was doesn't really fix the
problem

04:16:36.750 --> 04:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it appears after much
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
discussion that the best way to solve
 
04:16:45.070 --> 04:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
this problem is not through legislative
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
action so that's why we're making the
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
motion of itl on this bill
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative Carman I'm sure you have
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh a different point of
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
view you are correct in that respect Mr
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so what course of action
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
would you suggest given that the
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
utilities at least Unitil has proven
 
04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do what needs to be done
 
04:17:12.910 --> 04:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
and given that we are in this situ
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
situation where people who are using
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
these meters for 100% residential use in
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
residential units are being charged
 
04:17:23.880 --> 04:17:25.710 align:start position:0%
residential units are being charged
commercial

04:17:25.710 --> 04:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
rates so we suggest this be handled
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
through homeowners
 
04:17:34.590 --> 04:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
association um rules Andor
 
04:17:34.600 --> 04:17:36.109 align:start position:0%
association um rules Andor
um

04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
Charters um articles of agreement
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
whatever um we think that's the best way
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
to handle this and and the difference
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
between the amount that the people who
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
are being charged commercial rates and
 
04:17:51.630 --> 04:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
the and residential rates is probably so
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
small and affects so few people that we
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
think that's a better way to handle this
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
than to put something into
 
04:17:59.950 --> 04:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
legislation actually the difference
 
04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
between commercial and residential rates
 
04:18:03.550 --> 04:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
the rates might not be that different
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
but the customer charge is significantly
 
04:18:09.550 --> 04:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
different um and in terms of handling it
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the way that you suggest what that
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
would mean would be that individuals
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
would be on the hook for bills that go
 
04:18:20.950 --> 04:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
to other units and it's one thing for a
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners association to be billing
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
individual units that has the force of
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
the homeowners association but if let's
 
04:18:32.670 --> 04:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
say you and I share a meter and you're
 
04:18:37.229 --> 04:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
the uh account holder of record and I
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
decide I'm not going to pay you this
 
04:18:41.309 --> 04:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
month it's going to be a problem between
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
us and very difficult resolve so I I
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
really think that the way that the
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
amendment spells it out is really the
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
best way to go to make sure that things
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
really work
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
out okay further discussion
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah I would
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
just say uh to that is that right now
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill goes to the homeowners
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
association and gets built at a
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
commercial rate then the homeowners
 
04:19:07.389 --> 04:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
association has to collect that money
 
04:19:09.149 --> 04:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
from the individual homeowners that
 
04:19:10.830 --> 04:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
would be the same thing as this they
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
would see you if you kept it going to
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
somebody of some centralized place
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
they're still forced to collect it
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's Bill for electricity or the
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners association dues the same
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
problem exists with people not paying
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
this this that's not a justification for
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
this because that problem already
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
exists further discussion representative
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair but doesn't the
 
04:19:32.479 --> 04:19:33.349 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair but doesn't the
bill

04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
simply resolve the issue of uh or force
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of converting this to
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
residential rates versus commercial
 
04:19:45.309 --> 04:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
rates right it it's actually addressing
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
the one thing that the homeowners
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
association hasn't been able to resolve
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
with the utilities simply because they
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
treat homeowners associations as
 
04:19:57.550 --> 04:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
commercial entities rather than um
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's not a commercial
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
Enterprise it's a it's a
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
residential uh use so that's the thing
 
04:20:06.189 --> 04:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
that this simple bill was trying to
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
resolve and I don't I don't see how we
 
04:20:12.070 --> 04:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
you go back to square one for one thing
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
but also so I believe that when Urus
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
first started testifying when Mr robar
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
was on the stand he said we had a bill
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
last year uh I don't I think it might
 
04:20:23.309 --> 04:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
have been in Commerce or it was
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and um and they decided
 
04:20:29.550 --> 04:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
that it could be solved outside of
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislative action but they didn't they
 
04:20:33.630 --> 04:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
didn't resolve it that's why this bill
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
came up this year so I feel like we're
 
04:20:39.750 --> 04:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road by uh
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
creating itl and if we pass this through
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee it gets to be discussed
 
04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
through the remainder of the process and
 
04:20:48.269 --> 04:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
actually have a chance at possibly being
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
resolved rather than us uh not solving
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
it for another year for folks who I
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
think deserve some kind of
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
response further discussion
 
04:21:01.389 --> 04:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you one
 
04:21:03.309 --> 04:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
thing that I would add is when the
 
04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met last week there was an
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
attorney who was here who specializes in
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
condominium law and explain to us why
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
this solution that that's being proposed
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
just isn't going to work in practice and
 
04:21:18.720 --> 04:21:22.030 align:start position:0%
just isn't going to work in practice and
in

04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%

close that executive session
 
04:22:46.109 --> 04:22:46.119 align:start position:0%
and now we move on to House Bill 266 I
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
open an exact session on that bill and
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Harington for a
 
04:22:55.269 --> 04:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill chair recognizes representative
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
Berney I second that moved and seconded
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of retain on
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill 266 chair recognizes
 
04:23:07.439 --> 04:23:08.630 align:start position:0%
House Bill 266 chair recognizes
representative

04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah there seems to be a
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
rather strong disagreement between the
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and the
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy on exactly who does
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
what when and where we've had a lot of
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
going back and forth on this and
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
nothing's come to a conclusion so I
 
04:23:24.590 --> 04:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
think this needs more work and um we
 
04:23:25.950 --> 04:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to dismiss it but we don't
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
want to pass it either so and
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
retain further discussion further
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
discussion sorry representative
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
McGee I shudder to take the microphone
 
04:23:39.790 --> 04:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
on this one but uh I actually thought
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
the changes in the bill as we uh
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed them when they were reverted
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
back to some of the original language
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
was quite simple and straightforward so
 
04:23:49.870 --> 04:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't see it as a problem for us to I
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
mean I think the Pu was suggesting that
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
we create a study committee um it's
 
04:23:57.109 --> 04:23:57.119 align:start position:0%
really just delineating who does what
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
and clarifying the role of the
 
04:24:01.109 --> 04:24:01.119 align:start position:0%
Department of energy in the context of
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
pu proceedings and I didn't see anything
 
04:24:04.199 --> 04:24:05.950 align:start position:0%
pu proceedings and I didn't see anything
particularly

04:24:05.950 --> 04:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh worthy of of retaining um or studying
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh but I I mean maybe we could someone
 
04:24:16.990 --> 04:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
could explain to me what it is that's in
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
the bill that seems to be confusing
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
because I I didn't see anything that
 
04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward well the problem seems
 
04:24:28.109 --> 04:24:28.119 align:start position:0%
to be that we still don't have any kind
 
04:24:30.910 --> 04:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
of agreement between the doe and the Pu
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
so even though the language seems pretty
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
straightforward to
 
04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
us if they can't agree to it then it
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
seems further work is necessary in order
 
04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
to come up with a proposal that they can
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee since I
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
brought it up I guess the way I would
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
view that though is um the bill I I
 
04:25:01.750 --> 04:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
believe was brought by the department of
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
energy for clarification of what they
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
believe their role is and there is an
 
04:25:08.550 --> 04:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
exception from the Pu that says that the
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
Pu doesn't see the department of
 
04:25:12.670 --> 04:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
Energy's role the same so the question
 
04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be whether our committee which
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
deals with both bodies and understands
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
both of their statutory
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
mandates uh can clarify that for the
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
world and um you know I didn't see
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
anything unreasonable in terms of what
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
the doe was proposing I think the only
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
issue that we have here is um how the
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission sees their
 
04:25:40.030 --> 04:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
role and that um they would like to have
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
more jurisdiction over the doe when I I
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
look at it that the doe has jurisdiction
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
over the Pu if anything they're the
 
04:25:48.359 --> 04:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
over the Pu if anything they're the
overarching

04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
overarching
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
agency Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh well because of that and
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
because there seems to be no hardcore
 
04:25:59.309 --> 04:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
agreement between two departments far be
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
from us to get into the middle of an
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
argument between two departments we'd
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
rather have them work out something I
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
would rather not tell one or the other
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
what to do over the other it seemed like
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
we had a solution but then when we to
 
04:26:15.309 --> 04:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
work session uh pu seemed to be a little
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
bit uh not quite decided and would
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
rather have a study well that tells me
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
that they really didn't accept the
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
solution that was offered I think more
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
time is needed uh for them to work it
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
out so that's why I would favor
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
retaining the
 
04:26:33.109 --> 04:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman yeah I guess
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I just Just Disagree
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully with with the vice chair uh
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
what he just said I feel like
 
04:26:46.349 --> 04:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
the question here is who's the boss um
 
04:26:48.630 --> 04:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
and who's the decider you know who works
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
for who
 
04:26:54.269 --> 04:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that we should decide
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:26:59.710 --> 04:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
and pass the bill as aend as uh as we
 
04:27:01.710 --> 04:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
have it before us with an amendment I
 
04:27:04.349 --> 04:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
mean they did I looks to me like doe did
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
agree to a change that the Pu requested
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
but at some
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
point somebody needs to make a decision
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
I think it's us and then the agencies go
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
and work do their work in the way as
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislature disputes such as the one
 
04:27:27.870 --> 04:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
between the doe and the Pu are usually
 
04:27:32.189 --> 04:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
handled by the executive departments and
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
administration committee this bill was
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
originally assigned to that committee
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
but it was vacated to our committee for
 
04:27:43.950 --> 04:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
a different purpose purp and that
 
04:27:47.710 --> 04:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
purpose was to attach an amendment about
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
um something somewhat different than the
 
04:27:51.399 --> 04:27:53.910 align:start position:0%
um something somewhat different than the
original

04:27:53.910 --> 04:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:27:56.750 --> 04:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill after the bill was assigned to our
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
committee it was determined that the
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh was envisioned for that bill was not
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
Germaine and so it couldn't be done but
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
at that point it was too late to assign
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
the Bill back to vacate the bill back to
 
04:28:16.349 --> 04:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
the Edna
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee I would like to defer to that
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee's expertise and how to resolve
 
04:28:22.720 --> 04:28:23.830 align:start position:0%
committee's expertise and how to resolve
these

04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
complaints from you know between two
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
agencies before we make a decision
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
especially since we don't have an
 
04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:28:39.630 --> 04:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
266 V Thomas yes representative not yes
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yes
 
04:28:53.229 --> 04:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
representative brne yes representative
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
Bernardi yes representative PL yes
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%

04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%

04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Wendy Thomas no
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%

rolds no representative La relle no
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative fos no chairman V yes 108
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
so by a vote of 10 to8 the committee
 
04:29:31.269 --> 04:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
adopts the motion of retain retain means
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
that the bill stays with the committee
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
it does not go to the house floor so it
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
will need no majority or Minority Report
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative Berney yeah just a
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
question so on on the bill it says
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
or no that's who the bill was originally
 
04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
assigned to and after it got vacated to
 
04:29:58.239 --> 04:29:59.269 align:start position:0%
assigned to and after it got vacated to
our

04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:30:02.590 --> 04:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee I don't think OS at that point
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
changes the committee that it was
 
04:30:07.109 --> 04:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
originally assigned to I think the OS
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
assumes that that's a house rules matter
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
not a OS drafting matter so that's why
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
the original committee stays listed on
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bill I hope that answers your
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you you
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
bet all right so we'll close that uh
 
04:30:31.830 --> 04:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
executive session and now we'll open an
 
04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 759 FN
 
04:30:37.229 --> 04:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
04:30:37.239 --> 04:30:42.070 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
Harrington

04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
down this one I move to itl
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to legislate chair
 
04:30:48.510 --> 04:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative N I second the
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded that we itl
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
Harrington to tell you the truth I
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
didn't think I was speaking on this bill
 
04:31:05.469 --> 04:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
but so maybe somebody else can pick it
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
up because I I didn't realize I was
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
being tked with this I'd have to look up
 
04:31:08.760 --> 04:31:10.469 align:start position:0%
being tked with this I'd have to look up
my

04:31:10.469 --> 04:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
notes Okay so so this bill is the
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
customer generator bill that expands uh
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
of customer generator to include
 
04:31:25.630 --> 04:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
something called Community generator and
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
there were enough problems with this
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
bill that we just didn't think it was
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time and need needed
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
further work before we could go forward
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
with it and um that's basically our
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
rationale further discussion
 
04:31:43.080 --> 04:31:44.189 align:start position:0%
rationale further discussion
representative

04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
Corman so given that you just said that
 
04:31:48.910 --> 04:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
the bill needs further work could we
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill we could but we want to try to
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
minimize retains to the bills that were
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
that were absolutely baffled
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
over well I mean we seem kind of baffled
 
04:32:07.469 --> 04:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
over this one or at least some some of
 
04:32:07.479 --> 04:32:09.389 align:start position:0%
over this one or at least some some of

us
 
04:32:13.630 --> 04:32:13.640 align:start position:0%

our side further

the committee majority report will there
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
be a Minority Report yes that'll be uh
 
04:33:23.709 --> 04:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.719 --> 04:33:25.789 align:start position:0%
 
Corman

04:33:25.789 --> 04:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
Corman
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay we'll close the executive session
 
04:33:30.990 --> 04:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:33:33.789 --> 04:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
759 and now move to an executive session
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
04:33:38.349 --> 04:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
760 and I will make the motion of itl
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
and recognize Vice chair Thomas there a
 
04:33:41.199 --> 04:33:42.230 align:start position:0%
and recognize Vice chair Thomas there a
second

04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:33:43.949 --> 04:33:43.959 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that we adopt the
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
motion of itl on House Bill
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
760 the rationale here is that there is
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
an open docket at the Pu that needs to
 
04:33:56.910 --> 04:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
comp We Believe needs to complete before
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
any action could be taken on this uh on
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
this entire
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
situation focuses on how to eliminate
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
some middleman costs
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
and if that can be done in a with
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
minimal risk it could save some very
 
04:34:20.949 --> 04:34:20.959 align:start position:0%
serious money for rate payers in the
 
04:34:20.959 --> 04:34:21.869 align:start position:0%
serious money for rate payers in the
long

04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:34:26.709 --> 04:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
term so we feel that uh we don't need to
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
do take any action on this at this time
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
we talked about possibly retaining this
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
bill but we feel we don't really need to
 
04:34:37.869 --> 04:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
do that uh if it becomes a problem in
 
04:34:39.869 --> 04:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
the long term that we'll deal with it at
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that time further disc
 
04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
04:34:49.230 --> 04:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so which docket are we
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
saying that we are we're uh pushing this
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
off for because we're waiting for some
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
decision you want the docket number well
 
04:35:00.990 --> 04:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
I guess the reason I'm asking is because
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the order that came out Friday that
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
basically uh closed or dissolved the
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
pending docket that I believe would
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.789 --> 04:35:17.799 align:start position:0%
22-06 and that was the one that was on
 
04:35:21.390 --> 04:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
um uh distributed utility net metering
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
tariffs and the uh compensation
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
basically for de the looking at all of
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
those issues that we've been trying to
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
get a handle on for a while that docket
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
we just got an order on Friday saying
 
04:35:37.230 --> 04:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's gone to an investigative State and
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
maybe never to be heard from again
 
04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's no more uh imperative to
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
get that one out the door so if we're
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to defer to something
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
that should be coming out of the Public
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission then maybe we
 
04:35:49.080 --> 04:35:49.830 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission then maybe we
should

04:35:49.830 --> 04:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
be uh sure that it's actually still
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
going at the
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
Pu because there may not be any answer
 
04:35:59.470 --> 04:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
coming anytime
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
soon good question the docket that was
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
closed on Friday is a net metering
 
04:36:07.470 --> 04:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
docket doesn't relate to this issue the
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
three dockets that do relate to this
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
issue are the e24 d122
 
04:36:12.240 --> 04:36:13.709 align:start position:0%
issue are the e24 d122
de

04:36:13.709 --> 04:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
de
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
064 and those dockets uh are all
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
concerning um the utilities use of a
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
non- bypassable charge to rec recover
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
costs related to the use of um the spot
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
Market when buying
 
04:36:40.109 --> 04:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
load for their respective
 
04:36:43.470 --> 04:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
utilities f discussion needed
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah the the docket
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
was not just net metering tariffs though
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
it also related to compensation
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
for distributed energy resources I
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe it the docket had kind of a long
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
title and it it it wasn't just on the
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
tariff I have to go find it Well I read
 
04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
it on Friday afternoon or actually on
 
04:37:09.551 --> 04:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
Saturday I believe and
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
um the way I understood it it was about
 
04:37:14.109 --> 04:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
the net metering docket that had been
 
04:37:16.029 --> 04:37:16.039 align:start position:0%
opened back in
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%

04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%

Corman representative
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
Corman it's getting all
 
04:38:34.029 --> 04:38:34.039 align:start position:0%
okay with that we'll close the exec
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
760 next we'll move to House Bill 761 I
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
open an exec session and recognize
 
04:38:43.000 --> 04:38:44.670 align:start position:0%
open an exec session and recognize
representative

04:38:44.670 --> 04:38:44.680 align:start position:0%

04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
PL thank you I motion to itl HB
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
761 chair recognizes representative
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I second the motion moved and
 
04:38:58.830 --> 04:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
seconded that we adopt the motion of itl
 
04:39:04.109 --> 04:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
761 I believe the big issue here is the
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
issue of how to
 
04:39:12.510 --> 04:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
prevent charging a battery from the grid
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then selling the energy back at a
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
higher cost at some later time there are
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
no guard rails in the bill
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
whatsoever the the basic premise of the
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
bill makes sense but without guard rails
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
we just decided we couldn't move forward
 
04:39:32.189 --> 04:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Corman thank
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
you I I don't recall that coming up
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
during the discussion of the bill uh
 
04:39:42.670 --> 04:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
maybe did but I don't recall call it um
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
but the main thing is that the bill
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
allows for the Department to adopt rules
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
in the commission to approve tariffs and
 
04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
issue orders so in fact that situation
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
that you just described can be handled
 
04:39:58.990 --> 04:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
way sort of except that the adoption of
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
rules has to have a legislative
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
imperative so just saying that the
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
commission or the department
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
should adopt rules doesn't give them any
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
direction about what those rules should
 
04:40:17.560 --> 04:40:18.628 align:start position:0%
direction about what those rules should
look

04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:40:21.390 --> 04:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
like that's where the guardrails aspect
 
04:40:23.708 --> 04:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
comes into play if we'd have told them
 
04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
okay we need you to adopt rules
 
04:40:25.878 --> 04:40:28.350 align:start position:0%
okay we need you to adopt rules
to

04:40:28.350 --> 04:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
prevent uh the charging of the battery
 
04:40:32.040 --> 04:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
prevent uh the charging of the battery
from

04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
non from the grid and then the selling
 
04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
back of the electricity at a later date
 
04:40:43.868 --> 04:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
at a high rate or higher cost then that
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
would have given them something to go on
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
but without spelling it out in
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislation they have no no basis on
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
which to make a rule given that could we
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
retain the bill and make that addition
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
to the bill and
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
year if we're going to wait and pass it
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
next year maybe a a better bill that
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
spells everything out would be the
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
better way to
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
go representative L
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
roell yes it's to me this sounds like a
 
04:41:24.430 --> 04:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
free market incentive to do load
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
leveling and therefore provides a
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
system thank you further comment Vice
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas thank you Mr chair yeah I I
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
have to agree with uh the chairman here
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
I absolutely liked the this bill I
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
thought it made a lot of sense but it
 
04:41:46.510 --> 04:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
was lacking a key ingredient to have a
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
guard rail it's not our it's not our
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
place to fix bills like that if there
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
was a window perhaps but uh I think like
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
they say here uh you you can resubmit
 
04:41:59.788 --> 04:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
next year on this although the whole
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
idea of the bill I liked but we need to
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
have some concrete guard rail so that
 
04:42:06.670 --> 04:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
rules representative McGee thank you Mr
 
04:42:12.510 --> 04:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
chair and I just want to piggyback on
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative lar shelle's point
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
because what I was going to say is that
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
um if we do have a free market then what
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
we want is we want accurate price
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
signals and if someone does have a
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
battery even if if the sheller plant the
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
plants that are going to solar and
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
batteries if they decide that they want
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
to uh make sure their batteries are full
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
at a time when prices are lower and then
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
put energy onto the system when the
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
prices are higher that's not them that's
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
not them rigging anything that's them
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
being paid the value for providing
 
04:42:52.750 --> 04:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
energy that again shaves the load when
 
04:42:54.990 --> 04:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
we want the load shaved so there's a
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
there's an increased value and um energy
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
isn't the same cost at all times of day
 
04:43:05.470 --> 04:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
and I and so and it's that way for a
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
reason right so I I think because the
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
value has already been established that
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
when we need the energy and everybody's
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get energy that's when we want
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
more energy on the system that there
 
04:43:20.430 --> 04:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
there needs to be sort of a premium paid
 
04:43:22.110 --> 04:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
to those people who are able to put
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
energy on the system at that time that's
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
the market working the way it's supposed
 
04:43:27.550 --> 04:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
to that's what the bill is supposed to
 
04:43:31.708 --> 04:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
do is to uh enable storage which is
 
04:43:33.030 --> 04:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
something that again we've been kind of
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
holding back for um you know a lack of
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
our understanding to be able to enable
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
it but this bill doesn't do anything
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh detrimental to the market it it
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
actually leverages the market which I
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
think was the point that representative
 
04:43:53.310 --> 04:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
L Rell was trying to make and quite
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
quite good for your first major
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
contribution thanks representative
 
04:44:03.070 --> 04:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman yeah just
 
04:44:05.948 --> 04:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
following on to what my um ranking
 
04:44:08.190 --> 04:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
member just said
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that both the Department of
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
energy and the Public Utilities
 
04:44:18.430 --> 04:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
Commission uh operate under statutory
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
do set rates and and make policy and
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
such that you know rates are just and
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable so why don't we just Empower
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
them you know charge them with doing
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
their job doing the thing that this bill
 
04:44:37.390 --> 04:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh would Empower them to do and trust
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they'll do it I don't think that
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
the committee needs I'm I'm trying to
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around what we would even
 
04:44:46.708 --> 04:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
put into the bill that we would then
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
specify I mean that's why we have
 
04:44:52.830 --> 04:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
executive agencies with expertise to do
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
the things that we policy makers say do
 
04:44:58.030 --> 04:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
you know and um enable storage to
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
contribute value to the Grid in a way
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's fair and trust that they'll do
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.868 --> 04:45:09.878 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee I guess
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
the last question is you know in seeing
 
04:45:16.110 --> 04:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
bills go down that are at least um
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
looking to assist the competitive market
 
04:45:21.550 --> 04:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
and and assist the local sustainable
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
generation and storage aspects of the
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire energy Market I just want
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
to ask what benefit we think we gain by
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
delaying that another year um storage
 
04:45:35.708 --> 04:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
controversial and having a concern about
 
04:45:39.000 --> 04:45:41.948 align:start position:0%
controversial and having a concern about
somebody

04:45:41.948 --> 04:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
04:45:44.430 --> 04:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
making some kind of ill-gotten gain
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
because they discharge their energy when
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh more valuable I mean most people
 
04:45:51.868 --> 04:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
that invest in storage which is quite
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
expensive would be looking to do that
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
that's something we want so we don't
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
really need to police that at this at at
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
this level um because the storage adds
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
the benefit uh of Greater stability to
 
04:46:05.680 --> 04:46:06.390 align:start position:0%
the benefit uh of Greater stability to
the

04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
system and also again shaving load so
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
those are both desirable aspects that
 
04:46:16.150 --> 04:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
get enabled by this bill and we don't we
 
04:46:17.708 --> 04:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
don't have to make all the decisions
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
about how the rules will work out or how
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission will
 
04:46:25.270 --> 04:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
extend valuation but we I I don't see
 
04:46:27.070 --> 04:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
why we would kill a bill that all of us
 
04:46:29.150 --> 04:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
initially thought was a good
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
bill um when we don't have a good reason
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
to kill the bill and to delay further
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
when people are really seeking for us to
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
solve this stuff
 
04:46:44.190 --> 04:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Corman
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you you know I we we talk a lot
 
04:46:49.708 --> 04:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
about reliability as well and storage is
 
04:46:51.868 --> 04:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
an important aspect of that you know you
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
think about what uh what was going on
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
New Year's Eve of 22 when several
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
generators were were down storage could
 
04:47:02.310 --> 04:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
have been a big part of that solution
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we need to be doing what we
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
can for storage it is time shifted
 
04:47:12.390 --> 04:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
generation shifted to when it's needed
 
04:47:12.400 --> 04:47:14.868 align:start position:0%
generation shifted to when it's needed

04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%

04:48:40.510 --> 04:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
before I will mention it now that all
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
the committee reports need to be

Tuesday all right now we've got two

nter thank you Mr chairman just a bottom
 
04:49:22.030 --> 04:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
line is this um bill is very expensive
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
project between 320 to $430
 
04:49:30.270 --> 04:49:30.280 align:start position:0%

04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
plans so we had an extensive discussion
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
on this this
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
morning centered around a
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative McGee
 
04:49:44.958 --> 04:49:47.230 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative McGee
offered

04:49:47.230 --> 04:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
offered
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
which at first blush looked like a
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
useful Amendment but after we talked
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
about it for quite some time it became
 
04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
apparent that that amendment was uh not
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
something that was going to
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
work uh or that would would result in
 
04:50:10.990 --> 04:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
a useful report that the committee could
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
make some use of going
 
04:50:17.470 --> 04:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
forward so I think that's the uh the
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
explanation for why at itl is the
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
best the best way forward for this bill
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative McGee
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you well um I had suggested before
 
04:50:31.548 --> 04:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
we left our work session that perhaps a
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
study committee would be the way to go
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
so that we could actually get our act
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
together as a committee in terms of what
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would like to understand because the
 
04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
issue of five years before anything
 
04:50:47.190 --> 04:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
begins on upgrades to
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
technology um I I I don't know if that's
 
04:50:53.708 --> 04:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
adequate or if that's holding up the
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
competitive markets or if that's um
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
detrimental to
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
um to customers I mean I I think it's
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
something that is really worthy of a
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
study which is why I propose that and I
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
realize that itl is now the motion on
 
04:51:12.190 --> 04:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
the floor but um but I would ask that
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
folks vote against the itl cuz just just
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
killing the work doesn't make it go away
 
04:51:19.948 --> 04:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
I mean uh this is stuff we still need
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
answers to so this may not be the right
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
solution and I will admit that I I think
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
the chairman knows I sort of rushed to
 
04:51:30.670 --> 04:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
Market with an amendment to take out the
 
04:51:33.510 --> 04:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh pieces that were suggesting how
 
04:51:37.868 --> 04:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
eversource could move forward with uh
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
converting uh interim meters you know
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
adop meters in the time period between
 
04:51:44.670 --> 04:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
now and the 5 years when they plan to
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
redo them all um I was trying to make
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we were saving people money
 
04:51:52.548 --> 04:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
there was never any uh cost evaluation
 
04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill that said it was hundreds
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars I wasn't asking
 
04:51:59.070 --> 04:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
them to replace all the meters so we
 
04:52:02.270 --> 04:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
just have to read the bill but the what
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
I was offering with the
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
amendment was the idea that we should uh
 
04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
have some better sense of when when
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
certain capabilities are going to be
 
04:52:14.590 --> 04:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
supported and right now we don't have
 
04:52:16.350 --> 04:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
that answer and we're saying it's going
 
04:52:17.948 --> 04:52:17.958 align:start position:0%
to be answered over at the Public
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission but it we don't
 
04:52:22.708 --> 04:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
have any timelines for any turnaround on
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
this so is it 6 months is it one year is
 
04:52:27.150 --> 04:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
it 18 months will we'd be doing this in
 
04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
two years why can't we solicit our own
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
information so we have an idea what can
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
and cannot be enabled and I I just I
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:52:44.670 --> 04:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington whether you look at the amend
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
the am the newest Amendment or the bill
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
itself the me of the bill is that they
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
going to get a report on compliance with
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
FK order
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
2222 so be submitted no late in November
 
04:52:55.400 --> 04:52:56.830 align:start position:0%
2222 so be submitted no late in November
1st

04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:53:00.590 --> 04:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
2025 and my concern the issue there is
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be a public
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
document they subit to FK anyone that
 
04:53:04.548 --> 04:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
wants a copy of it you would have get
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
one we don't need a law to to obtain a
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
copy of a filing the utility makes with
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.230 --> 04:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
FKS deadline may be November 1st of
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
2026 further discussion representative
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you one issue that always
 
04:53:32.910 --> 04:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
comes up in bills like this is the uh
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
software changes that need to be made in
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
the back end of the systems at Utilities
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
in particular ever source and um I'm
 
04:53:45.548 --> 04:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
hoping Mr Lata is paying attention as
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'm saying this but it seems that either
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
these systems are Baroque and perhaps
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
written in coall so that it's very hard
 
04:54:01.230 --> 04:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
to find programmers who can work on them
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
or the programmers are way overpaid
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
given the amount of money that we hear
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
that these changes are going to require
 
04:54:12.548 --> 04:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
I I just find it hard to believe that
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
some of these changes are going to
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
require some of the amounts of money
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
that we've been hearing and I'm not
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
speaking specifically about this bill
 
04:54:20.590 --> 04:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
but we just keep hearing it over and
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
over you know it sounds like changing
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
one line of code is going to cost
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um I know enough about software
 
04:54:30.910 --> 04:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
having been in computer science for 51
 
04:54:35.390 --> 04:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
years that it's not that it's not as
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
expensive as we're hearing and it seems
 
04:54:39.390 --> 04:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
to me that a lot of what we're hearing
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
is an excuse for
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
inertia further
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%

04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:46.990 --> 04:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
Bernardi so we have many issues in this
 
04:56:49.548 --> 04:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
bill that are under cons consideration
 
04:56:52.750 --> 04:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
by both the doe and pu this is a
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
recurring pattern of trying to push a
 
04:56:58.030 --> 04:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
bill before we have uh our
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
administrative agency's work complete uh
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
it further codifies some things that uh
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
we we were codifying them in the law
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
before we even know what they are
 
04:57:13.830 --> 04:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
we had all regulatory all regulated
 
04:57:17.190 --> 04:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
utilities come up and oppose this bill
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
um we have load settlement charges that
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
benefit only one
 
04:57:25.350 --> 04:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
organization uh and uh we had uh
 
04:57:28.110 --> 04:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that time of use rates that
 
04:57:33.030 --> 04:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
were uh available by the uh Cooperative
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
were really not uh well accepted at time
 
04:57:39.510 --> 04:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a bill before its
 
04:57:39.520 --> 04:57:41.470 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a bill before its
time

04:57:41.470 --> 04:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman well that's
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
the perfect example for what I had asked
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
for again a study um there may be
 
04:57:55.030 --> 04:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill that could not go
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
forward or could not be defined in
 
04:58:00.150 --> 04:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
statute at this time under the arguments
 
04:58:02.310 --> 04:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
that were made but there are other
 
04:58:05.548 --> 04:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
aspects where again we are playing
 
04:58:07.150 --> 04:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg with the Public
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission saying that they
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
are going going to come up with a
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
decision and then when they don't come
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
up with a decision we we we keep
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
defaulting to them and when when
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually it's it's our job to figure out
 
04:58:22.350 --> 04:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
if there are laws that we should be
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
defining that will help guide them they
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be able to sort these
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
issues out any better or faster than we
 
04:58:32.830 --> 04:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
are sorting them they they're they're
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
punting on things that have been with
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
them for three years and or more so uh
 
04:58:39.280 --> 04:58:40.670 align:start position:0%
them for three years and or more so uh
our

04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:58:43.110 --> 04:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
ability to rely on the Public Utilities
 
04:58:45.990 --> 04:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
Commission to resolve these issues and
 
04:58:49.628 --> 04:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
also to be impartial in terms of
 
04:58:52.270 --> 04:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
viewing all the parties that are
 
04:58:54.788 --> 04:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
involved it's it we're in a time of
 
04:58:56.670 --> 04:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
change they're going to have to figure
 
04:58:58.590 --> 04:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
out they're going to have to figure out
 
04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
how to accommodate a competitive market
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
which we haven't had for very long so
 
04:59:08.670 --> 04:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
somebody has to cry Uncle here and um I
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
think getting rid of all these bills
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
including this one which is about
 
04:59:14.000 --> 04:59:15.470 align:start position:0%
including this one which is about
completing

04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
completing
 
04:59:18.750 --> 04:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
reforms um that the energy Market is in
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
need of this one more than any of them
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
would make a great study committee but
 
04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
if we're going to itl all of them then
 
04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're basically deferring all of the
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
hard work that's been put in front of us
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
this year um to advance again the
 
04:59:35.510 --> 04:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
competitive market and that's that's the
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
only way I can describe it we're the
 
04:59:40.270 --> 04:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
ones that said we wanted competition and
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
now we're um we're allowing another
 
04:59:46.390 --> 04:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
entire year to go by without responding
 
04:59:48.190 --> 04:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
and saying well it's going to happen
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
over there but it it hasn't been
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
happening I mean there have been no no
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
answers on any of the questions we're
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
not putting storage into the statutory
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
language to give guidance this year so
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
is the Pu going to want to move forward
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to say oh it's not in the
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
statutory language and the same thing's
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to be happening for the reforms
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
that are listed in in 755
 
05:00:14.430 --> 05:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
so I I am in favor of this committee
 
05:00:16.270 --> 05:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
actually digging in and trying to figure
 
05:00:18.548 --> 05:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
out what we can accomplish this year
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
rather than just moving all of the you
 
05:00:24.190 --> 05:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
know the difficult work off uh as though
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility further discussion
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you you know
 
05:00:35.310 --> 05:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
at some
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
point we have to say damn it we're the
 
05:00:41.628 --> 05:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
legislature we're the ones who make the
 
05:00:44.430 --> 05:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the laws we're the ones who tell the
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
executive agencies what they are
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and if they're not
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
getting it done then we have to light a
 
05:00:52.350 --> 05:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
fire under them and they're not getting
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
it done we need to be lighting fires
 
05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
under these executive agencies that
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
aren't getting things done all the
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
authority all the power that the
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
executive agencies have derive from the
 
05:01:07.590 --> 05:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think sometimes we
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
just have to throw our weight around and
 
05:01:14.110 --> 05:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
do further
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Sebert I would
 
05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
just like to make a comment that um you
 
05:01:22.910 --> 05:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of folks specifically
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
in this room that like to say constantly
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
bash Congress for how they can't get
 
05:01:29.868 --> 05:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
anything done and how they don't do
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
their job and right now we've become
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
just that that's what that's what's
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
happening right here and I would just um
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
even go further and say that it's it's
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
not a we are doing that um it's one side
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the aisle in this room thank you
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to have to
 
05:01:51.990 --> 05:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with all three of you on this
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
point you cannot mandate
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
competition competition occurs because
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
people want
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
it and if there is a human cry from the
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
general public about having a utility
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
Market that's different from the one we
 
05:02:16.350 --> 05:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
have today then the public will rise up
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
and inform the utilities that they want
 
05:02:22.590 --> 05:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
changes made and the utilities being
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
customer oriented will make sure that
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
that change
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
happens but we as a legislature cannot
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
mandate those
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
changes without running the risk of
 
05:02:42.548 --> 05:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
seriously damaging the existing
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
structure competition and Innovation
 
05:02:49.150 --> 05:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
does not come from the top down it comes
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
from the bottom up and you can't mandate
 
05:02:57.548 --> 05:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
Innovation representative Corman thank
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
you you can't vote for your utility you
 
05:03:03.150 --> 05:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
can vote for your representative but you
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
can't vote for your utility I can't vote
 
05:03:08.350 --> 05:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
oh I'm going to leave Liberty and go to
 
05:03:08.360 --> 05:03:10.230 align:start position:0%
oh I'm going to leave Liberty and go to
eversource

05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
I can vote for a different rep but I
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
can't vote to do that so I disagree with
 
05:03:17.360 --> 05:03:19.910 align:start position:0%
can't vote to do that so I disagree with
that

05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
premise you can talk to your utility
 
05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
though and tell them what you want and
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
if enough people do that the utility
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
will do that I think that's one of the
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
reasons the community power Coalition
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
exists is because they determined that
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
they could have a bigger Collective
 
05:03:38.400 --> 05:03:40.190 align:start position:0%
they could have a bigger Collective
voice

05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
voice
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
by gathering a bunch of people together
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
to try to make change and they are
 
05:03:48.510 --> 05:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
working in the direction of doing that
 
05:03:51.070 --> 05:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
and as they gain experience maybe
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
they'll get good at it in the future the
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
utility is what we call a natural
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
monopoly so I mean I I can't I can't
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
switch utilities I can switch electric
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
suppliers but that's all I can
 
05:04:07.868 --> 05:04:07.878 align:start position:0%
switch I understand that point but you
 
05:04:10.510 --> 05:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
still can't mandate innovation res uh
 
05:04:10.520 --> 05:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
still can't mandate innovation res uh
representative

05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:14.670 --> 05:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
reinolds thank you Mr chairman um you
 
05:04:17.470 --> 05:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to disagree perhaps with
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of what you said you know in the
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
kind of in the abstract
 
05:04:27.548 --> 05:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
but energy markets the particularly
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
electricity Market what we deal with
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
most of the time it's not a free market
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
it's a highly regulated market the there
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
players individual customers have
 
05:04:39.958 --> 05:04:41.708 align:start position:0%
players individual customers have
limited

05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
limited
 
05:04:44.110 --> 05:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
choices they also have limited knowledge
 
05:04:46.990 --> 05:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's really complicated stuff how does
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
the electricity that powers my home get
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
here and what are all the inputs and
 
05:04:54.150 --> 05:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
what are all the costs involved
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
transmission distribution the other
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
charges it's all very complicated it's
 
05:05:00.390 --> 05:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
our job here at the science technology
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
and energy committee to represent the
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
people they're not going to call the
 
05:05:08.190 --> 05:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
utility and say I want to do this so
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing we're not I
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
don't think think the bills that we have
 
05:05:15.708 --> 05:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
been talking about today are mandating
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.830 --> 05:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
enabling the evolution of the
 
05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
competitive market for electricity that
 
05:05:30.190 --> 05:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
was set in motion back in
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
1997 nearly 30 years ago when when the
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you know
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
deregulated the utilities made the
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
Monopoly utilities divest of generation
 
05:05:43.948 --> 05:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
and ushered in the rest it's been almost
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
30 years and we're still waiting for the
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
truly competitive market for many of
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
these Energy Services to
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
evolve and it's our job to continue to
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
make small changes small policy
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
changes and then charge our department
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
of energy and pu with putting those
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
changes into place this committee and
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
the Full House just adopted your bill Mr
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
chairman a couple of weeks ago stating a
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
new energy policy for the State of New
 
05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it had a lot in it about
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
competition and Market forces but that
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
stuff's not going to come forward all by
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
itself and it isn't going to come
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
forward by allowing the utilities to
 
05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
keep saying
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
well we don't know enough yet to do that
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we've got a plan that starts 5 years
 
05:06:34.190 --> 05:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
from now to put that enabling technology
 
05:06:37.470 --> 05:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
in place and and then the Pu with this
 
05:06:40.430 --> 05:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
docket that they started three years ago
 
05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
only to come out last Friday and say
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
oh it's closed no
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
conclusion I mean really three years of
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
delay waiting for policy to come out and
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
then nothing and I don't think we should
 
05:06:58.150 --> 05:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.548 --> 05:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
that so I hear what you're
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
saying but I have to respectfully
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
disagree in 1997 we structured the re
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
restructured the electricity Market to
 
05:07:13.470 --> 05:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
try to encourage
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
competition if we had been successful
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
there would be no such thing as default
 
05:07:19.548 --> 05:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
service right
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
now everybody would be getting their
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
electricity from an alternative
 
05:07:27.310 --> 05:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
supplier but that hasn't
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
happened because there's no motivation
 
05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
on the part of the average
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
person to go out and do the hard work of
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
chasing down an alternative supplier
 
05:07:44.830 --> 05:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
from whom they can buy cheaper
 
05:07:46.750 --> 05:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
electricity they're
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
there and people could be buying from
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
them if they really wanted to but
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
apparently they don't so a lot of people
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
still re rely on default service that's
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
why it
 
05:07:57.520 --> 05:07:59.230 align:start position:0%
why it
exists

05:07:59.230 --> 05:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
exists
 
05:08:01.948 --> 05:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there are barriers to
 
05:08:01.958 --> 05:08:02.830 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there are barriers to
that

05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:05.948 --> 05:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
competition it's there people can take
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of it if they want to so far
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to because they're
 
05:08:13.070 --> 05:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
basically satisfied with the St status
 
05:08:13.080 --> 05:08:14.948 align:start position:0%
basically satisfied with the St status
quo

05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
quo
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
and while I do agree that there are
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
things we can do to remove barriers and
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
improve the status quo I don't
 
05:08:24.750 --> 05:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily think the bill that we're
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
considering right now is one of
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
those representative
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.910 --> 05:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
chair Innovation you can't mandate it
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
but you can provide an environment that
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
encourages it it I'm a retired research
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
scientist and I work for Dupont and as
 
05:08:46.830 --> 05:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
you may know Dupont was a very
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative company because they provided
 
05:08:52.190 --> 05:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
an environment that encouraged
 
05:08:55.548 --> 05:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
Innovation uh personally I
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
received significant financial awards
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
for Innovations I
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
made uh I was allowed time to do
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
research in areas that wasn't part of my
 
05:09:06.430 --> 05:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
assignment resulting again in
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
Innovations I think you have to provide
 
05:09:12.150 --> 05:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
encourage ment and room for Innovation
 
05:09:12.160 --> 05:09:13.628 align:start position:0%
encourage ment and room for Innovation
to

05:09:13.628 --> 05:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:09:15.548 --> 05:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
occur thank
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
you a point well taken and I would
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that deont is a private
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
company they're not the government and
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
mandates from the government take a
 
05:09:29.628 --> 05:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
different form than encouragement from a
 
05:09:29.638 --> 05:09:31.030 align:start position:0%
different form than encouragement from a
private

05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
private
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
company representative Berne has a
 
05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
comment thank you chairman just just to
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
add to that um in the private company
 
05:09:39.000 --> 05:09:40.230 align:start position:0%
add to that um in the private company
case

05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
um they have an incentive a financial
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
profit incentive to take risks and and
 
05:09:48.510 --> 05:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
make a profit from that in this case the
 
05:09:51.350 --> 05:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
utility uh most of their uh Capital
 
05:09:54.270 --> 05:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
Investments or any other cost they just
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
they they I mean they have an incentive
 
05:09:57.390 --> 05:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
to do a reasonable job but they don't
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to
 
05:10:03.150 --> 05:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
um they they don't profit from from
 
05:10:06.110 --> 05:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
their choices in that sense so um and
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
maybe if if the bill allowed them to
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
profit I don't know um that's something
 
05:10:12.070 --> 05:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
to think about I
 
05:10:16.708 --> 05:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
guess representative Corman thank you um
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
regarding your comments Mr chairman
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
about people being satisfied with
 
05:10:22.990 --> 05:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
default service first of all a huge
 
05:10:25.548 --> 05:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
percentage of our state is not on
 
05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
default service and is being served by
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition including
 
05:10:31.708 --> 05:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
your town and my
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
town but there are other situations for
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
example when I first heard about
 
05:10:40.230 --> 05:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply Long before Community
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
power I actually checked it out and what
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
I saw was that I'd be getting locked
 
05:10:47.430 --> 05:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
into a contract and I didn't want to
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
locked into a contract with default
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
service all right there's no contract
 
05:10:54.270 --> 05:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
and I can maybe go to community power or
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
not now I have to be on default service
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
choice further discussion representative
 
05:11:09.868 --> 05:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair yeah the point
 
05:11:11.948 --> 05:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make is back to the
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
environment that we are providing in the
 
05:11:17.830 --> 05:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
state it it isn't a mandate to recognize
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that if you don't have a Level
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
Playing Field then competition is skewed
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
right in a competitive market you want
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
to just start everybody on a Level
 
05:11:32.190 --> 05:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
Playing Field and so what what we've
 
05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
learned since enabling Community power
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
to come into being is that it's like
 
05:11:39.788 --> 05:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
having a public option right that there
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
owned by their members they're uh
 
05:11:45.788 --> 05:11:45.798 align:start position:0%
transparent in that you can attend their
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
meetings you can see all their minutes
 
05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
online and they're working directly with
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
towns with representatives in those
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
towns who can communicate back to the
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
governments of those Towns how they
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
operate what they're what you know what
 
05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
changes are undergoing in the company so
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's a a service or oriented
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
organization with a mission of bringing
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
lower costs and what they're finding
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
since we enabled them to become that
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
competitive uh player in the market here
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is that there are
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of their business that they
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
can't deliver on because the um the I
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to say Monopoly utilities but
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
basically the default utilities you know
 
05:12:28.628 --> 05:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
have the advantage they're they have the
 
05:12:30.270 --> 05:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
home field advantage right they own the
 
05:12:31.548 --> 05:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
poles and wires they own the
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
interconnections they uh they own the
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
data they own the you name it a villing
 
05:12:40.110 --> 05:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
and so and so
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
as we have enabled somebody to become a
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
major player in the state we've also
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
failed to continue to look at the other
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
issues around the business model and
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
that isn't about mandating anything it's
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
about recognizing whether it's a Level
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
Playing Field whether there's anything
 
05:13:00.670 --> 05:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
else we should be doing in order to
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
fully realize the value of the
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
competition that we you know we started
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
it but then maybe we didn't know how to
 
05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
bring it into full being and so the
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
stuff that's being put in front of us a
 
05:13:17.708 --> 05:13:17.718 align:start position:0%
lot of it is being penned by you know
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
Cliff below because he is so
 
05:13:21.788 --> 05:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in in energy and we can
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
say well we we like that or we don't
 
05:13:25.150 --> 05:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
like that or we want to help them or we
 
05:13:26.910 --> 05:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to help them it isn't really
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
about all of that it's about they are
 
05:13:31.390 --> 05:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
already an established player they are
 
05:13:33.670 --> 05:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
already representing towns all over New
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we should be looking at the
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues they're bringing to us to see
 
05:13:41.070 --> 05:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's any thing we need to do
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
and instead we're going to it itl all
 
05:13:47.230 --> 05:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
these bills and just disregard it all
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I I don't understand inexpedient to
 
05:13:53.590 --> 05:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislate on these bills if we don't
 
05:13:56.430 --> 05:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
understand what reforming uh the market
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
should look like we should study it we
 
05:14:02.788 --> 05:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:04.990 --> 05:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
road one of the things you forgot to
 
05:14:07.110 --> 05:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
mention in your thoughtful remarks that
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
you just made was that
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
the incumbent utilities own something
 
05:14:17.070 --> 05:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
else that's incredibly important they
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
own the reliability of our electric
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
grid and that is probably more important
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
than anything else the reliability of
 
05:14:31.628 --> 05:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
the grid we always want it to be there
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
people get very upset when they lose
 
05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
their electricity yeah they'd also like
 
05:14:39.750 --> 05:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
it to be cheap who wouldn't
 
05:14:42.830 --> 05:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
but the main thing they care about is
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
reliability and anything that tampers
 
05:14:49.868 --> 05:14:49.878 align:start position:0%
with the existing market for electricity
 
05:14:52.990 --> 05:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
runs the risk of decreasing the
 
05:14:55.788 --> 05:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
reliability of the grid so we have to be
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
very careful and very deliberate when we
 
05:14:58.920 --> 05:15:00.030 align:start position:0%
very careful and very deliberate when we
make

05:15:00.030 --> 05:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
decisions that will make
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
changes that could jeopardize the
 
05:15:07.868 --> 05:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
reliability of our grid that's one of
 
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
the things that I have emphas I ized
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over the last couple of years
 
05:15:14.548 --> 05:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:15:17.788 --> 05:15:17.798 align:start position:0%
reliability is job number one for this
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
legislature as far as the electric grid
 
05:15:20.240 --> 05:15:21.110 align:start position:0%
legislature as far as the electric grid
is

05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
concerned representative
 
05:15:26.990 --> 05:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
Sebert um instead of well I guess
 
05:15:28.510 --> 05:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
because a lot of terms are being used
 
05:15:30.510 --> 05:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
here but I would just say like consumer
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
protections should be one of our number
 
05:15:35.910 --> 05:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
one goals here um and fighting for the
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
consumer and I think assuming that
 
05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
they're just complacent is completely
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
wrong um to do thank you thank you for
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
reinforcing my point the consumer wants
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
reliability and that's what we're
 
05:15:51.948 --> 05:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
fighting for representative
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
Foss but if their grid is not reliable
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
then we are removing their ease of them
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
finding another option not everyone is
 
05:16:04.750 --> 05:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the existing reliability
 
05:16:06.350 --> 05:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
of their default service it it
 
05:16:10.350 --> 05:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
definitely depends on where you are in
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
the state so we are removing the their
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
reliable okay representative McGee yeah
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
um I think everyone agrees with the
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
reliability I mean we have words that
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
represent Concepts that we all agree on
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
of course we want reliable energy but
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're discussing um
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
whoever is supplying our energy we
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
expect it to be reliable and of course
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
are uh maintaining the poles and wires
 
05:16:43.868 --> 05:16:43.878 align:start position:0%
and the systems that help us when
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
there's a storm and there's outages yeah
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's Great Value in in what the
 
05:16:51.510 --> 05:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
utilities do I'm not I'm not questioning
 
05:16:55.948 --> 05:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
that I'm saying we have a new player in
 
05:16:59.868 --> 05:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
the market we have uh we have the
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
ability to hold back their ability to
 
05:17:07.230 --> 05:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
fully participate or um the ability to
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
figure out what the new paradigm is so
 
05:17:10.390 --> 05:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
everybody can play together in the pool
 
05:17:12.350 --> 05:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
the right way and it means more work
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
with with the utilities and with the any
 
05:17:18.030 --> 05:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
other competitors competitive suppliers
 
05:17:20.830 --> 05:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out what that balance is but
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
the Pu isn't getting it done the Pu
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
isn't answering the important questions
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
about the value of net metering and
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
changes to the Tariff when they get
 
05:17:32.190 --> 05:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders coming in front of them
 
05:17:33.868 --> 05:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
saying this is what we think it should
 
05:17:37.230 --> 05:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
be they say well we have different
 
05:17:38.990 --> 05:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
information which we can't show you but
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
we've developed our own evidence so
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's new you know it it that's
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
not the way the Pu has traditionally
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
operated and so the legislature can't
 
05:17:56.548 --> 05:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
stand silent in the face of no decisions
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
when it's affecting businesses and it's
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
affecting rate payers out there who are
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
expecting uh the markets to operate to
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
their benefit and uh the players are
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
doing their best to try and they're
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
doing their best to try and provide
 
05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
those services but right now you know I
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say the legislator the
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
Pu I don't want to just even point
 
05:18:20.270 --> 05:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
fingers but just saying the government
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire is is not
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
helping we're in the way because we're
 
05:18:27.788 --> 05:18:27.798 align:start position:0%
not bothering to address the very real
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
concerns that are being brought to
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
us all right we start to seem to be
 
05:18:34.670 --> 05:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
going around in circles here
 
05:18:34.680 --> 05:18:35.830 align:start position:0%
going around in circles here
representative

05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah rather than talk about
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
General philosophy I'd like to talk
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
about the bill just a little bit um and
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
on page three of the bill it talks about
 
05:18:47.788 --> 05:18:47.798 align:start position:0%
pursuant to relevant ISO New England
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
tariffs and so forth it sounds as if
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
we're getting in the the states getting
 
05:18:54.030 --> 05:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
in the regulation of iso wholesale
 
05:18:57.470 --> 05:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
markets and we're dealing with the uh
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
some report that's not going to be out
 
05:19:01.708 --> 05:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
until November 1st 2026 I think we
 
05:19:03.430 --> 05:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
should see the report before we start
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
putting that the results of that report
 
05:19:09.868 --> 05:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay I think we've gone on long enough
 
05:19:14.830 --> 05:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
about this debate so I'm going to ask
 
05:19:16.510 --> 05:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
