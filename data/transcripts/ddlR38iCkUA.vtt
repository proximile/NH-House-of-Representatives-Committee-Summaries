00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
penalties for driving without a license
um

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
from what i understand
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
it used to be
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be driving caught driving without a
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
driver's license and a number a handful
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
of years ago it changed to a
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um charge
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
which is an upgraded penalty
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that this bill the intent of
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is to bring it back to a
 
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.750 align:start position:0%
this bill is to bring it back to a
violation

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.710 align:start position:0%
violation
to

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
make it a little more manageable for
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
those who are perhaps
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
lower income
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
have challenges
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%

a license at the time for a number of
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
reasons but i would
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
like to defer most of the questions to
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%

there is no need to to inflict such
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
harsh punishment
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
for somebody
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's driving and committing no other
 
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.150 align:start position:0%
that's driving and committing no other
offense

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
especially when it's the first time that
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
they do it you know it really makes no
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
sense to mark somebody for life and and
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
mess their
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
their background
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
and and their record
 
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
and and their record
for

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
something that you know it's not even
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
a big deal unless you're driving drunk
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
or doing something or you're a habitual
 
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.949 align:start position:0%
or doing something or you're a habitual
offender

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
offender
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
we used to do that in new hampshire
 
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.150 align:start position:0%
we used to do that in new hampshire
before

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it really makes no sense it can
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
affect people's ability
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
to earn a living it can affect people
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
ability to even
 
00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.430 align:start position:0%
ability to even
get

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.629 align:start position:0%
get
school

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
school

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
so you know this is too harsh a
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
punishment for somebody that that is
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
just driving
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%

committee

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:03.829 align:start position:0%
very much for testifying
um

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
we have another bill coming up later in
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
which is going to be relative to the
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
licensure of non-resident aliens
 
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
licensure of non-resident aliens
temporarily

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
your request is that based on the fact
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
non-resident people that are picked up
 
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
non-resident people that are picked up
for

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
driving without a license are unable to
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
get a license because of their
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
immigration status
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
well right now a lot but this this bill
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily only affect
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
those people but yes it is a big part of
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill people right now are not
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
entitled to get a driver's license
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
depending on certain immigration status
 
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
depending on certain immigration status
so

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
but this bill affects other you know
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
like sometimes young people
 
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.629 align:start position:0%
like sometimes young people
that

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
got their you know their
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
cars or something they haven't had time
 
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
cars or something they haven't had time
to

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
to to get their driver's license or
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
haven't made the effort so that affects

so um so the idea of
 
00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
so um so the idea of
trying

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
trying
 
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
trying
to

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
to
help

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants in the state
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
and people that are not able to to get a
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the state because they don't have a
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
social security number
 
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
social security number
we

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with representative sykes
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
uh representative talaski as well
 
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.269 align:start position:0%
uh representative talaski as well
we

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
came up with a b with the idea
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
to revert back
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation that had been in place
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
for many many years and reverted to
 
00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:52.389 align:start position:0%
for many many years and reverted to
um

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
to criminalizing driving without a
 
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.670 align:start position:0%
to criminalizing driving without a
license

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
so the the idea the goal uh to
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
to this bill this legislation is to
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
make a violation when someone is picked
 
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.829 align:start position:0%
make a violation when someone is picked
up

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
driving without a license
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
and if that person is picked up again
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
within a year then it becomes a
 
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.629 align:start position:0%
within a year then it becomes a
misdemeanor

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
if that person doesn't become
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't get
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
pulled over within a year then it goes
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
back to a violation
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
so and the reason being is because
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
many immigrants uh families uh good
 
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.870 align:start position:0%
many immigrants uh families uh good
people

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
that you know come to this country uh
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
seeking a better life
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
they have to go to work
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately uh they have to pick
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
up uh you know their kids in school
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
drop off you know the
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know drop off you know the kids you
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
know to
 
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
know to
soccer

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
soccer
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
and you know like many other things that
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
they have to do on the daily basis
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as the at the moment
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that they leave
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
their house they get into their car it
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
becomes a nightmare for them because you
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
know they're always afraid that they're
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
gonna get pulled over and they're gonna
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
be sent to ice and be placed in removal
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
proceedings which uh commonly known as
 
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
proceedings which uh commonly known as
deportation

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
deportation
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill would actually
 
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
so this bill would actually
um

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
help you know like the courts in not
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
being overcrowded with unnecessary cases
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
and would help the courts to
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
be more focused on serious cases
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know serious crimes especially with
 
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.190 align:start position:0%
you know serious crimes especially with
opioids

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
and not really
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
you know have to deal with these patio
 
00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.029 align:start position:0%

country
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
and i just want to i don't want to
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
restate the important points that have
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
been already made
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
but i do want a flag for you that you do
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
have in your email
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
some written testimony from the new
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire immigrant rights network a
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
statewide coalition of partners working
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
to advance humane immigration policy at
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
state and local levels and this is a
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
priority bill
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
you also have a letter from my colleague
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
co-worker grace kendeke
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
a member of our afsc staff
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
i want to just emphasize the context in
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
which we're making this uh we're
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
supporting this proposal and that is
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
that congress for decades has failed to
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
act to create
 
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.669 align:start position:0%
act to create
a

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
a coherent
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
immigration system in the united states
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the result of that including for
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
many hundreds of families in new
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that people who have lived
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
here 10
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
20 or more years simply do not have in
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
the current context a path to
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
regularizing their immigration status
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
but their lives are here they're raising
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
their families here they're running
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
businesses they're members of our
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
churches and local communities and in a
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
state that lacks
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
substantial infrastructure for public
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
transportation a car is essential so
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
we've put a lot of people into an
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
awkward position where they have to risk
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
this legal consequence simply to get
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
their child to a doctor's appointment to
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
get to a job etc
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
so this is a proposal that
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the context of a broader national
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
conversation about reducing some of the
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
criminalization in our society and
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
finding more thoughtful responses to
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
community problems this would give a
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
small tool
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh to or or an opening for law
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement to respond
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh in more thoughtful ways
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
again not for habitual offenders but for
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who one time is pulled over
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
and found to be driving without a
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
license so for that reason
 
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
we are very much in support of this bill
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
you may know that for people who who do
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
have a path to some sort of immigration
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
relief having even a misdemeanor or a
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
couple of misdemeanors on very minor
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
offenses can be enough to deny them
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
the the relief that they are trying to
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
get so we think it's a simple but very
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
effective step that we could take for a
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
healthier community
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh first off i want
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
can you all go there we go
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
first off i want to apologize to the
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
committee and to the people who made the
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
trek here i'm sorry i was a few minutes
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
late to introduce my own bill
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
the question i have for you is is it not
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
true that
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would also help for instance a
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
single working parent
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
single working parent
who

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
for no reason or other who happened to
 
00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.230 align:start position:0%
for no reason or other who happened to
be

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
a long-standing citizen of this country
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
neglected to get his license
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
renewed immediately and then discovered
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
the mistake
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
based on being stopped and that would
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
then in turn create a misdemeanor which
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
is of course much more serious
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct there are so
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
many people living in our state for whom
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
their poverty is extremely costly
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so the even the cost of renewing a
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
license or the the chaos of holding
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
multiple jobs while caring for a family
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
and deadlines pass and people don't
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
renew their licenses then triggers
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
consequences that can then cause further
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
problems in their lives so it is true
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
that they would clearly benefit from
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
is it also not true that this um
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
particular passage of our state laws
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
back in 2015 it was indeed a uh
 
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
back in 2015 it was indeed a uh
violation

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that was a change at that time
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
and now we're just trying to revert back
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
to where it was that's right that is
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative gorski
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
dan thank you miss fogerty for
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
testifying today i have a question for
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
that if someone is convicted or
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
currently as a misdemeanor their life is
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
impacted could you elaborate more
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
of kind of if that happens kind of
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
what happens if in fact they get
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
charged with a misdemeanor
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and do you mean in the immigration
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
context or in just a broad range of
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
broad range of context
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes well certainly uh in the
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
immigration context to have one or more
 
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.430 align:start position:0%
immigration context to have one or more
misdemeanors

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
can

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
so negatively impact a person's
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
application for an immigration relief of
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
some kind that it could be justification
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
for them being denied which then can
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
lead to their detention and their
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
deportation so those consequences are
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
are acute
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
but not sadly not rare
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the course of life of someone who's
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
not in the immigration legal system
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
accumulated criminal
 
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.230 align:start position:0%
accumulated criminal
offenses

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
negatively impact a future setting in
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
which they may need to be in court or
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
trying to make a case as a reliable
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
person i mean someone who's looking at
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
their record could see that as
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
a negative mark that perhaps denies them
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
housing or denies them some kind of loan
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
or some other
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
some other benefits like that or that
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
accentuates criminal legal consequences
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
if if something else happens
 
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:11.590 align:start position:0%
if if something else happens
yeah

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the bill
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch i'm passing around a
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
letter that's also in your email we have
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
a request on this bill to
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
we have no position on the on the policy
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill we do have a request that
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
the effective date be changed to january
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
1 2023
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
and as is explained in the letter
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
there's a statute that governs effective
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
dates rsa 14 colon 9-a
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
and it says each law affecting judicial
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure or establishing
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
or eliminating criminal procedure or
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition blah blah blah shall take
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
effect on the january one following
 
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.230 align:start position:0%
effect on the january one following
passage

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
passage
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
and and the reason for that is there are
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
just a large number of bills that
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
have an impact on a
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
on statutes that deal with
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
with crimes with judicial practice and
 
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.909 align:start position:0%
with crimes with judicial practice and
procedure

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
and so for example in this bill
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
it would eliminate
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
the paragraph numbers it would change
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the sentence so
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
when an officer when a when a law
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer is charging a crime
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
we have a system under j-1 in the
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
uniform charge table which identifies
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
what the crime is what the paragraph is
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the statute what the line is
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
essentially of the statute and what is
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the what is the penalty
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
any time that changes the j-1 uniform
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
charge table has to be amended and then
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
within the judicial branch our system
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
called odyssey has essentially the same
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
thing every line of a criminal statute
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
has a line in our odyssey system and
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
every time there's a change to that our
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
system has to change in order to make
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
sure that we are properly recording the
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
the charge that has been filed in the
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
court it takes a little bit of time to
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
get all of those changes in both with
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
the department of safety the attorney
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
general's office and the judicial branch
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
in order to make all of these things
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
line up so we do ask that without any
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
regard to the policy that if this bill
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
proceeds um that the effective date be
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
changed january 1 2023 thank you and be

and as an amendment uh to a bill last
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%

good morning chair and good morning
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
honorable committee my name is dennis
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
green i'm from rockingham district 13. i
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
represent hampstead in kingston
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
i brought this bill forth because
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's been much littering on our
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
highways and it doesn't seem to get
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
stopped or cleaned up
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed it many times and
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
i've spoken to several local police
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
departments i've spoke to the high
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
sheriff of rockingham county
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i've been out with state troopers
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
before the covid uh out of troop a
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason i increased this because
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
we have a beautiful state here and
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
there's no need of it to be destroyed
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's live free or dying not to trash our
 
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.990 align:start position:0%
it's live free or dying not to trash our
state

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.750 align:start position:0%
state
so

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
in this past weekend i noticed i was in
 
00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:07.830 align:start position:0%
in this past weekend i noticed i was in
seabrook

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
seabrook
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
i stopped at market basket
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
and as i was getting out i was stepping
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
on a trash bag
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
while a supermarket bag
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
i picked it up and inside the bag
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
was somebody's bones from a roasted
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
chicken that they must have gotten into
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
a market basket and they just tossed it
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
out of their car
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
out of their car
and

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday i was walking my dog
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i happened to see a car stop over by
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
a church where i was walking my dog and
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
a guy tossed something out
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
so i said well i'll check it out later
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
and as i walked by where he stopped
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
there was a bottle
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
appears to be like a liquor bottle
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
and it was filled with urine
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it was disgusting
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and because i didn't have gloves on i
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to touch it but i will pick
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
it up
 
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
it up
and

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
talking with the police departments
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
the fine
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
is really not that much right now
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
compared to other things that they could
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
be stopping people for
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
so they said if there was an increase in
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
the penalty it might be worthwhile i'm
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
not looking to change the
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
to a fennel a felony
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
but i am looking to increase the fine to
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
stop the trash
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
and i'd be glad to take any questions
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.430 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
greene um i do have one question
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the methodology it uh calls on the
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
third offense for
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
the driver's license to be suspended but
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specifically state for how
 
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specifically state for how
long

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think that would be the discretion of
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much you're
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
i believe it's like a hundred and ten
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
dollars you could ask these troopers for
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
sure but i'm not 100 sure
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative gorski
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh in terms of the
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative greene for
 
00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:27.190 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative greene for
testifying

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
um the 300 and 500 dollar figures how
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
did those
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
kind of come how do those get calculated
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
why 300 500
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's like inflation
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
our inflation our economy has gone way
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
high the
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
gasoline has gone up
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
our groceries have gone up and i just
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
says i want to send a message to stop it
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the only way you're going to send a
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
message is to increase the fines to a
 
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.069 align:start position:0%
message is to increase the fines to a
point

00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up why not make the
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
first one 500.
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
you can change that
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
um i do not have anybody else signed up
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
to speak on this is there anybody else
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
that wishes to i think he had a hand up
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
do you have is it possible to get um
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
something like that universal code of
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
penalties that the
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
the department of justice
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
or the you know keeps and get that to us
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
so we can compare this request with all
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
the other offenses that might exist
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that we can put it into perspective
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm sort of looking at the gentleman
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
which defines um under new hampshire
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
code uh littering for a natural person
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
is uh listed as a 62 first offense fine
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
all by 124
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent fine
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
the non-natural person showing must
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
i understand that we're able to
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
in a discrete kind of way to compare
 
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.670 align:start position:0%
in a discrete kind of way to compare
littering

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
littering
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
where it was and where it is what i'm
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
the information to is
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
how does this compare to other motor
 
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.150 align:start position:0%
how does this compare to other motor
vehicle

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
stops if you will or violations
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we've had in the
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
past i don't i guess i would continue
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we've had in the
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
past is that we have tried to increase
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
some fines and there's a lot of pushback
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know and so without having that
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the basis of what how it
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
compares to many other offenses
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
if this helps because it doesn't sound
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
like they've got the information here
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
that is something we can look up and
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
have it before we execute the bill that
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
would be great okay thank you mr
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you this is her you're
 
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.349 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you this is her you're
welcome

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
question um i'm just curious if in your
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
research before filing this bill you got
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
any numbers on the number of violations
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
of citations actually issued i'm just i
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
know our law enforcement is pulled
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
really thin and
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
directing them to you know pull cards
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
over handout violations for this is the
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
best use of their time so i'm just
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
wondering the extent of what we're
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the number of litterers
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
that actually get
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
caught and cited that's why i increased
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the fine because their time is worth a
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
lot more than 62
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
for pulling a car over for throwing
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
something out
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why i put the
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
increase up to 300 along with the fact
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.430 align:start position:0%
but
what

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
else were you looking for
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if you know the uh the
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
number of violations that were issued in
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
the last year or the year prior no i
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
don't but i can almost say that if daily
 
00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.109 align:start position:0%
don't but i can almost say that if daily
uh

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say every day but i'll bet
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
you three times a week i have seen it
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that data is even
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
available but we can look for it as well
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%

01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
is that better yes
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
my name is priscilla vaughn i've been
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
working for the state of new hampshire
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
for close to 40 years i run the bureau
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
of title and anti-theft
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrator
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
this bill is a little concerning
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
it will cost the state of new hampshire
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
fi approximately 5 million dollars
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's also going to also lose revenue
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me lose revenue of 5 million
 
01:05:20.079 --> 01:05:21.029 align:start position:0%
excuse me lose revenue of 5 million
dollars

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
local revenue for the town and city
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
we did an estimate in the last three
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
years 2018 19 and 20 of the revenue
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
this has a little conflict with the
 
01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
this has a little conflict with the
federal

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
odometer statement
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
the federal law 580.17
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
it requires
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
disclose odometers on vehicles that are
 
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
disclose odometers on vehicles that are
sold

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
for a 20-year period
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
it was 10 it's graduating now to a
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
20-year period
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
so this would be pretty difficult to be
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
able to disclose your odometer when you
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a title because the
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
title has the odometer
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
information on the back
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what you pass on to the buyer
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
is a title
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
the other issue that the state has is um
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
salvage vehicles
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stakeholders involved
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
you have the insurance companies you
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
have the dealers you have uh
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
private individuals you have lien
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
holders that can lean
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
lend money on vehicles and if they don't
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
have a perfected lien they're going to
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
have a very difficult time getting a
 
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.589 align:start position:0%
have a very difficult time getting a
loan

01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of stakeholders
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
involved and this is a very short period
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
of time a 2015 is a fairly new car
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
is a new car obviously for a lot of
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
people and there's a lot of
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are older than that
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
that are on the road
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i have a feeling that this is going
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's all i have okay
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative dollersky
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
question in very simple layman's terms
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what the um purpose of a
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
title is
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
the perfect the perfection of a title
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be you can disclose um odometer
 
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
would be you can disclose um odometer
fraud

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
brands so if you're buying a car right
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
now if you buy a car that's a 1999 you
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're getting
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
but if you buy a car that's a 2000 and
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
newer you know on that title it shows
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's proof of ownership
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
it shows if there's any brands if the
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
odometer has been rolled back
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
it shows if it's been salvaged flood
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
rebuilt there's a lot of good
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
information for consumer protection and
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
safety for our roads in new hampshire
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's very important to have a title
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative sykes did you have a
 
01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
representative sykes did you have a
question

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%

i will now call dan bennett from the new
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire auto dealers association

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
dealers association we are the trade
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%

01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
we are the car truck motorcycle
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%

equipment dealers
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
as well as collision repair
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
so a lot of businesses in all corners in
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
all counties of the states
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully we oppose hb 1489
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
for four main reasons uh they are um
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle title is a formal
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
document that that uh
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
that tracks a vehicle through its life
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
and ensures and proves its ownership um
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's what shows that you have the your
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
personal property is protected and that
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
you have the the claim of ownership to
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
that vehicle um as mentioned it's a
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
formal document uh if we relied simply
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
on a bill of sale
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
i could take a slip up paper from my
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
legal pad and meet you on the hallway
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
and make up a bill of sale for your real
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
quick you could do it on a cocktail
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
napkin at the barley house so
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
this is a formal document that's blessed
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
both by the uh the state
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
and our federal government through the
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
without the title process new hampshire
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
would become a destination for for
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
stolen vehicles and vehicle fraud um
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
because without that formal document
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
process just that simple bill sale flip
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
it real quick never be able to prove
 
01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:45.349 align:start position:0%
it real quick never be able to prove
ownership

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
and this would become a hotbed for it um
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
including even
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
we have very low fees there's no proof
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
of insurance um even with a title it's
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
27 fee very low uh nationwide so um
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
another thing that i'll mention real
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
quick the average age of vehicles is 12
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
years rl poke recently released it's a
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
little over 12 years so um with this
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
cutting it off at seven
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
would be incredibly problematic uh over
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
85 of the vehicles in the marketplace
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
are financed today okay so what a bank
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
uses when they decide to loan you money
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
to buy that car
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
is the title that's how they secure
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
their interest before they loan you x
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars they take hold of that
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
title until you pay them off and when
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
that loan is completed and paid off then
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
you now have the ownership of that
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle so that title document is key in
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle financing industry so
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
with 85 percent of vehicles being
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
financed if you eliminate the titling
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
process after seven years it will
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
decimate the used vehicle marketplace
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
for for citizens all over the state so
 
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.390 align:start position:0%
for for citizens all over the state so
um

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's really uh the one last thing i'll
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
say is uh i know you heard from
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
priscilla vaughn
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
the dealers association we represent
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
both independent and franchise dealers
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
so we have a tremendous amount of
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
interaction with them um
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
and and what i would like to say is the
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
dmv the title bureau ms vaughn and her
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
staff do a do a tremendous job ensuring
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
what can be a complicated process with
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
titles that come from different states
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
and different places to really provide
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
great customer service for um
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire citizens and new
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
the system right now really does work uh
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
testify and verify that so um with that
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
being said um i'll take any questions if
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
other states say maine new hampshire i
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
mean maine massachusetts
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
vermont what are their title programs
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
like and what is the length of time
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
before you need to have a
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
before you no longer need one
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so represent thank you for the
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
question unfortunately i don't have all
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
um 50 state title laws in um you know
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
off the top tip of my tongue i know that
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh we can find a document really is he
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
doing a 50-state summary and we can get
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
it over to you ms vaughn or one of her
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
staff may know here but if not i'll
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
certainly follow up because i'm sure the
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
the the national agency that deals with
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
titling ninvitis has a
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
quick state summary but all states title
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles um
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
in some
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
form or fashion okay
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
that would be good anyway representative
 
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.229 align:start position:0%
that would be good anyway representative
telersky

01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
telersky
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
question i don't want you to
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
put words in the sponsor's mouth since
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
he's not here but i really don't
 
01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
he's not here but i really don't
understand

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.229 align:start position:0%
understand
what

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
this bill what the reasoning behind it
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
who would benefit from this and why this
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's an appropriate
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
question to ask mr chair yeah it might
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
not be all right i guess i i will ask
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes thank you yeah you can
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to do this but they did
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
leave it with all of those
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
oh and we'll do it duh yes i'll keep the
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%

okay the next one is gonna be
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%

fn relative to driver education and
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is representative
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
susan army
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
right turn turn turn your mic on ah
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you right you've got the same ones
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
we do and we're still learning them
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes we are
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
hey thank you very much for hearing me
 
01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
hey thank you very much for hearing me
today

01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.590 align:start position:0%
today
uh

01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm coming to you today as the
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
originator of dedicated funds oversight
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
in this legislature not as the current
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
clerk of the joint committee on
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds but this bill originates
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
from there the joint committee has not
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this issue as we consider
 
01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:50.870 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this issue as we consider
all

01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
things like this should start with the
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
so here i am
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
the bill in its current state is
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
defective since i and some of the new
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver education teachers
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
association members
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of them here
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
did not have enough time to hash out all
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
the details
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
we hope you will be willing to take this
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill to interim study to allow these to
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
be decided
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
i approach this first and foremost as a
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
violation of the principles of our
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have a driver training fund which in
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
the 2011 budget bill was rated to
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
provide funding
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
primarily for the general fund and the
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
state's detective bureau
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
not for driver education
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
and it was made permanent in the budget
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
the money comes from vanity plate fees
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
arguably a highway fund item
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
the driving
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
training fund was established to
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
subsidize public schools costs of
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
providing driver training to their
 
01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
providing driver training to their
students

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
and to pay for the division of motor
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles administrative and student
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
manual costs
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
the 2011 budget decision removed the
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirement that public schools provide
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
this training and removed the subsidy
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
this meant that students now
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
must pay themselves or wait until age 18
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
to pass tests and acquire licenses
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
based on inadequate training
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
unless they have parents who are very
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
good drivers
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
this reduces road safety across the
 
01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.550 align:start position:0%
this reduces road safety across the
state

01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
costs of the private training now range
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
between i think it's four hundred to
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
seven hundred dollars in different towns
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
and areas
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
which is difficult for many many
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
families to afford
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
i apologize for my voice i have damaged
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
lungs and
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
in fy 21
 
01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:09.750 align:start position:0%
in fy 21
3.3

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
3.3
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
of this dedicated fund paid for the dos
 
01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.070 align:start position:0%
of this dedicated fund paid for the dos
costs

01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the dmv apparently has stopped
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
paying for the driving class workbooks
 
01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:22.830 align:start position:0%
paying for the driving class workbooks
although

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh and the driver training schools are
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
having to print them out themselves
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
because a workbook needs to be on paper
 
01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
because a workbook needs to be on paper
usually

01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
20 was transferred to the detective's
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
although their positions would more
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately have been funded from the
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund received 76.7
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the funds collected for driver
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
training in an unusual lapse that occurs
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the biennium instead
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
of at the end
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
because of what was done
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
the structure of driver education has
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
shifted markedly there is almost no
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
public school which provides driver
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
education itself
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
it is all carried out by private driving
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
schools which are trying to balance
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
between the labor intensive work they do
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
to produce responsible drivers and the
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
inability of many potential students to
 
01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
inability of many potential students to
pay

01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
removing half the revenue
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
being used for other purposes
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
including the detectives bureau can
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
cause pain in other places
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
the state could afford to subsidize the
 
01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:45.669 align:start position:0%
the state could afford to subsidize the
process

01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
by up to four hundred dollars per
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
student by restricting it to lower
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
income students
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
those with free or
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
free or reduced lunch or in private
 
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.669 align:start position:0%
free or reduced lunch or in private
schools

01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
a similar program
 
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
a similar program
uh

01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
or in private schools a similar program
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
used by them to qualify their low-income
 
01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:08.149 align:start position:0%
used by them to qualify their low-income
students

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the lapse would be moved
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of
 
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.149 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of
fy24

01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
fy24
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
next year to the end of the biennium
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
like all other lapses in dedicated funds
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
which would allow the finance committees
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
to move the positions funded in the
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
detectives bureau to the general fund
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
but the main focus
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
is driver and road safety
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
when someone is tailgating you at 75
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
miles an hour in the travel lane it just
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
happened to me several times on the way
 
01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.109 align:start position:0%
happened to me several times on the way
down

01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
or veering in front of you to catch an
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
exit or a break in the traffic
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
or driving at 80 miles an hour on a
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
slippery road
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
remember how we have been educating or
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
not educating the driving students since
 
01:39:00.239 --> 01:39:02.149 align:start position:0%
not educating the driving students since
2012.

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are you able to
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
as much as i can okay any questions from
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative talersky
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative almi for taking
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
we hear often about the cost of driver's
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
education so i was very interested in
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
seeing this come through and excited
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
about the possibility um
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
can you go into a little more detail
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
about what the problems might be is
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
there any way they could be fixed with
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment or is it something that's
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to take more long-term discussions
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
there within the
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
the driver training group
 
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.070 align:start position:0%
the driver training group
on

01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
there are differences of how they are
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
being paid as i understand it
 
01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.550 align:start position:0%
being paid as i understand it
and

01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.350 align:start position:0%
and
those

01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be ironed out fairly
 
01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be ironed out fairly
quickly

01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the other question is one of
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
per student
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
could get past the finance committee if
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
this goes to the finance committee
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it's an early bill
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
it should be an early bill
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
99 sure that it is and it would either
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
go to my committee which is ways and
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
means and does dedicated funds they seem
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
to be a little erratic they always have
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
been erratic about whether we get them
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
or finance gets them
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
but there is a question of
 
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written right now it goes
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
to absolutely everybody including at
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
exeter academy
 
01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:49.669 align:start position:0%
exeter academy
and

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
it ends up being over three million
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
i know my committee knows that most
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
people think we have a terrific surplus
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
mostly because of the federal funds
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh stimulus but
 
01:41:07.199 --> 01:41:08.470 align:start position:0%
uh stimulus but
on

01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
a uh debit coming in
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
march april that could be as much as 90
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
to 100 million dollars
 
01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.229 align:start position:0%
to 100 million dollars
so

01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
we still are
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
being pretty tight in our financing in
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's based on something that we did
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
last year to
 
01:41:30.239 --> 01:41:31.590 align:start position:0%
last year to
return

01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
the money that we had taxed for the ppp
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
loans to the businesses
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
so we really
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
do need to watch what we're doing to our
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative korski
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative almighty for taking my
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
question if something like this was
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
passed do we have any estimates
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
or a range of how many students
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
that would come better from
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
head of the
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%

i'm
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
i've seen an estimate and i can't
 
01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:22.470 align:start position:0%
i've seen an estimate and i can't
remember

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
what it is it's
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh i think several thousands but
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
she'll she'll know much better okay
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah she'll be the next

reiterate my question
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
how many students would take what's the
 
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
estimate of how many students could take
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of this program if something
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
like this was passed
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
sure so the last time that i asked the
 
01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.149 align:start position:0%
sure so the last time that i asked the
um

01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
holly who was the administrator at the
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
dmv she told me about fifteen thousand
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
i've seen since then an average of about
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand seven hundred students a
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
year who take driver's ed okay the state
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
might be able to
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
get more accurate numbers than that
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
um i've seen the 12 700 figure but
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
um i believe the previous witness
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
suggested that there if we were to do
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
this on a
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
on a based on a low income
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
is there any estimate how many people
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
what we'd end up with for total i
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that information sir i'm
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank you
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
next up would be
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
steve lavoie and joe ebert from the dos
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.350 align:start position:0%
 
anytime

01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
good morning steve lavoie director of
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
administration for the department of
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
safety and with me is captain joe ebert
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
who runs the state police investigation
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
services bureau
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
first off i just wanted to let the
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee know that the department
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
is is neutral on the concept of
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
distributing funds to the driver ed
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
schools for this purpose um however we
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
are opposed to the bill as it's
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
the reason being that it eliminates 1.5
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars in funding that
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
currently supports the detectives bureau
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
or the investigative services bureau at
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state police
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
that that funding
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
represents a 13 reduction in
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
appropriations that was budgeted for
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
through the budget process and would be
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
eliminated effective july 1 of of 2022
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
obviously that would have a significant
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
state police and on the bureau and would
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
result in a reduction in force and i
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
turn it over to captain ebert to to give
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
the committee some testimony on what
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me for the purpose of the record
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
my name is joe ebert it's e-b-e-r-t
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
and as steve mentioned i am the
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
commander of the investigative services
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
bureau which is our detective bureau
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
within the state police
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
i just very quickly wanted to go over
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
what that entails and and what a budget
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
cut would mean
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
clearly uh it would mean layoffs or the
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
reduction of certain staff positions um
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
and these are the uh the units they're
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
in uh incorporated within investigative
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
services so you have the uh terrorism
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
and intelligence unit
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
the terrorism and intelligence unit
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
staffs the state's fusion center every
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
state has an intelligence fusion center
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
and our terrorism and intelligence unit
 
01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.350 align:start position:0%
and our terrorism and intelligence unit
is

01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
all tdwi to the
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
the fusion center with the exception of
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
one position which is uh assigned to the
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
fbi for the joint terrorism task force
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
so uh we would be tasked with uh
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
spreading spreading this reduction in
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
manpower over all of the units so
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
someone would
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
some position would need to be reduced
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
you have the special investigations unit
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit is your
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
cyber crime unit for the state of new
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire they do everything from
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
network intrusions
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
we almost uh exclusively concentrate on
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
state entities but they do network
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
intrusions they do
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
when there is some type of cyber enabled
 
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.229 align:start position:0%
when there is some type of cyber enabled
crime

01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
and of course they are involved in the
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
exchange of child pornography
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
investigations very heavily
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
you have your narcotics unit your
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
narcotics investigations unit
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
currently the state as i'm sure everyone
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
on the committee is where the state is
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
suffering from
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
the opioid epidemic
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
but we have recently seen a significant
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
increase in both cocaine and
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine into the state of new
 
01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.870 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine into the state of new
hampshire

01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
in just the past six months i i can
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
testify to the notion that your
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
narcotics unit which concentrates on
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
mid-level drug dealers has taken
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
or prohibited from entering the the
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire kilo upon kilo of
 
01:48:28.159 --> 01:48:29.030 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire kilo upon kilo of
uh

01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
illicit drug
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
and lastly you have your major crime
 
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
and lastly you have your major crime
unit

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
the major crime unit in the state police
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
covers the vast majority of homicides
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
within the state uh they also are the
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
sole entity for investigating
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
officer-involved shootings uh in
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
accordance and with oversight of the
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
i having been involved with the major
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
crime unit for
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
over 10 years i can tell you that there
 
01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.950 align:start position:0%
over 10 years i can tell you that there
is

01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that is more important
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
than seeking justice for the family
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the friends of someone whose life
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
has been taken via homicide
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
so we take that responsibility very
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
seriously we run on a very very limited
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
budget and limited manpower and that is
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
the case with every state entity so i i
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't say that as if somehow we are
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
being singled out
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's just the nature of the state of
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i've lived here my whole
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
life i've gotten used to that i've
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
worked here for 20 years i know that
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's the way that things go
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
but a reduction in the staffing within
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
that particular unit would truly mean a
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
reduction in the safety for the citizens
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
so those are the the four major units
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
within the investigative services bureau
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate very much the opportunity
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
to talk to you this morning and
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm more than willing to take any
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
questions as i'm sure the director is as
 
01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.589 align:start position:0%
questions as i'm sure the director is as
well

01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you commander for taking my
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police budget
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
overall is what that number is
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
actually i'm going to defer to director
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
levoy on that uh that that's
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
something that he's likely more able to
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i hesitate to give you a number off
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
the top of my head for the the entire
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
department this bureau
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
is over 11 million dollars yeah i i got
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
that from the handouts that you gave us
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
so is it possible for you to send that
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
information to us i absolutely can okay
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm trying to measure the
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
impact of
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
the lost revenues
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
as matched against the whole department
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
right rather than just your bureau
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
because i understand there's a huge
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and i can i can certainly provide
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
that information but i would just
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
caution that the division of state
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
police is funded with many different
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
revenue sources and there's a several
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
mixed funded there's highway funds
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
turnpike other dedicated so it's it's
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
complex and i'll be happy to provide you
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
any other members from the committee
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative ankerberg
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative you put your hand up
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
question um i'm looking at the rsa in
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
question 26352
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
for the driver training fund and i'm
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if either one of you can give
 
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:22.870 align:start position:0%
wondering if either one of you can give
me

01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
a little history
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
as to that change that happened in 2015
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
or 2016 to redirect these funds
 
01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.669 align:start position:0%
or 2016 to redirect these funds
um

01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
why that happened and
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
if you can give me any connection
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
obviously the new hampshire state police
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
and all of your your departments that
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
you just listed are obviously vital to
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
the safety of our state but
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
is there any connection whatsoever
 
01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.589 align:start position:0%
is there any connection whatsoever
to

01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
driver education and
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
for the most part teen safety driving on
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
the roads if you can try to make some
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
kind of connection on how that came
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
so i i can
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
try and answer this question uh the
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
director and i were actually having this
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh conversation right before we came in
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh to testify
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know the the specific reason for
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
why that uh why those funds were
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
directed toward the division of state
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
police and i've found myself in a
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
position over the last uh five years of
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
coming over to testify that oftentimes
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
a piece of
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
the budget that is allocated to the
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
state police and i can't give context
 
01:52:29.679 --> 01:52:30.390 align:start position:0%
state police and i can't give context
for

01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
why it is that uh it ended up that way
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
all i can say is that having testified
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the past there was there must have
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
been a reason and i i realized that
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's very vague but there must have
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
been a reason somebody came in before
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee just like this gave compelling
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh compelling reason as to why these
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
funds should be diverted
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
but one thing i do try and steer clear
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
of is is saying whether or not i find
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
that to be legitimate somebody at that
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
time found that to be a legitimate use
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
for those funds and i can tell you that
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh currently we rely on those funds but
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
your specific question ma'am i i don't
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
know why it is that they are allocated
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and i i i'd agree with uh with the
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
captain and i just add that um
 
01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:15.669 align:start position:0%
captain and i just add that um
uh

01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned these funds are are
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted through the the the biennial
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
budget process um
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
by the legislature every every biennium
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
and we've relied on those within this
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
area to fund the detectives bureau
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that future funding
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
needs to be supported with these funds
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
if other funds are available
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
they can certainly be utilized but the
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
key here is maintaining the existing
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
level of service that they're able to
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
provide but as far as the nexus i think
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
if you read the language in the law it's
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
clearly um it's it's silent um for a
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
purpose for a reason and that's because
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
there may not be a direct nexus to these
 
01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
there may not be a direct nexus to these
funds

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%

anyone else
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
wish to speak any from the audience on
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%

pass these on there's another one
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
another set see i don't want to make
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
sure i got one for him
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
you have one for tom yeah i do i make
 
01:56:09.119 --> 02:01:09.589 align:start position:0%
you have one for tom yeah i do i make
sure

02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.149 align:start position:0%
 
being

02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock i'll open up the public
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1208 fn
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
relative to driver education
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
there we go and it's all fixed thank you
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you members of the
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
community i'm representative tim lang i
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
am a third term rep uh for the belknap
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
for belknap four representing the towns
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
of samerton and tilton i'm the current
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
chair of fish and game
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
how you have before you uh a bill a
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
relative the driver's education this
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill is fairly simple and simple in its
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
process what it seeks to do is allow
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
parents the ability to choose whether or
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
not to send their child to a commercial
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
driver's education program or to perform
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
the driver's education program
 
02:02:09.199 --> 02:02:11.030 align:start position:0%
the driver's education program
themselves

02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
as i probably don't have to tell all you
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
but i probably will because that's the
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
way we are
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
is that if you don't know that parents
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
teach already a majority of especially
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
on-road driving that 40 hours of the
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
driving is taught by parents already
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
so any significant driving habits or
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
driving things are already taught by the
 
02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.669 align:start position:0%
driving things are already taught by the
parents

02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
so just to give you a couple statistics
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
and in the closest the newest study i
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
could find was from the state of
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
washington department of transportation
 
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
in 2020 that said there are 19 states
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
that currently don't have a driver's
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
education requirement
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
there are 16 states that overlap with
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
those that can overlap that also do
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
provide for an online driver's education
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
program full drivers education program
 
02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:54.629 align:start position:0%
program full drivers education program
online

02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
there was a colorado study but i will
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
say that it's going on 10 years old now
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
that did a study on accidents and
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
violations relative to driver's ed
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
non-driver's ed and it came back it
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
black better freight inconclusive there
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
was no statistically
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
large deviation in
 
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
students that took driver's ed and got a
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
violation of students didn't take driver
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
didn't got a violation
 
02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
didn't got a violation
um

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to do here again the
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
idea is to bring back
 
02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
idea is to bring back
um

02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know what used to be our traditional
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and you know probably a good portion of
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
the people in this room were taught to
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
drive by their parents and i would make
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
the assumption that most years are good
 
02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:33.109 align:start position:0%
the assumption that most years are good
drivers

02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so again you know the idea is to
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
allow those parents that want to to be
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
able to still provide the requirements
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
of drivers education so they still have
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
to provide the classroom training they
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
still have to provide on-the-road
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
training and they have to self-certify
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
that those things have been done
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then they would present that
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
self-certification to dmv and dmv would
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
waive the requirement for a formal
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
formal driver's education or commercial
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
which is probably the most important
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
word in this conversation is commercial
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
drivers education program
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's one of the few places in the state
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the state mandates a private
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
citizen must take a commercial uh
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
activity and that commercial activity
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
cost the average now is over seven
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
um i'll give you the anecdotal evidence
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
of my son when i went to go have my son
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
take the class i had to wait six months
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
because there was no availability for
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
class so my son while eligible to drive
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i could have taught him how to drive
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
unless i wanted to drive to concord or
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
hook set or or south or way up north
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
there was nothing in my region in the
 
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
laconia lakes regional region i could
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
have taken a class i had to wait six
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
months for him to take a class
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
and so again
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
i think these burdens we put on parents
 
02:04:40.719 --> 02:04:41.669 align:start position:0%
i think these burdens we put on parents
um

02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
are are troublesome and again it's the
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
only place where the state forces us to
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
say you have to pay a private entity 700
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
in order to have the privilege of
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
driving um for people and yet when you
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
turn 18 so you can be 17 years 364 days
 
02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:58.069 align:start position:0%
turn 18 so you can be 17 years 364 days
old

02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
old
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
and you have to have a driver's
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
education requirement to get a license
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh eight at 18 years old boom no
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
driver's edge requirement you can drive
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
you're considered just as safe on the
 
02:05:06.719 --> 02:05:07.589 align:start position:0%
you're considered just as safe on the
road

02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
road
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of consistency in
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.910 align:start position:0%
that conversation
um

02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
going on uh
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
last term we had this bill and i i was
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the speaker's office in the deputy
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
speaker's office discussing why this
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
bill was itled and what the concern was
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
and that i could try to overcome
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
the concern was blatantly said
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences we're afraid
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
that'll raise rates for all drivers in
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire if we do away
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the driver's education requirement
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
so doing my due diligence i went over to
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire insurance department i
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
met with the new hampshire assurance
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
department and they did whatever they do
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the back end and they came back and
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
said there will be no increase in
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
driver's costs
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
for the general public
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass what they did
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
say was parents would make the option
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want the discount
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's provided by driver's education or
 
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
that's provided by driver's education or
not

02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
that would be the only loss is if a
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
parent chose to self-certify
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
then they would not be entitled to the
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
driver's education program however
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's a caveat to that there are some
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
states and some insurance companies that
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
if you use certain um home school
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum do allow certification for
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
driver's education as long as you
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
certify that you went through that
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum so even giving a parent the
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
choice doesn't necessitate that they're
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to give up their discount the
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
discount is still a possibility if they
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
if they follow the curriculum for
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
homeschooling so to speak of driver's
 
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.709 align:start position:0%
homeschooling so to speak of driver's
education

02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:06:26.719 --> 02:06:27.589 align:start position:0%
education
um

02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
so again i want to be clear there's no
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
rate increase for the general public in
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire if this law
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
was to pass you would not see car
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
insurance rates increase
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
at least due to this reason can't tell
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
what the insurance companies will do for
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
um one of the interesting conversations
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
i had around this bill was i was
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
presenting this build to um to a rotary
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
club and in the rotary club we had
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
superintendents and a couple principals
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
from other schools
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
they indicated that this is a huge
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
problem for their schools because it
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
creates it severely creates a have and
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
have-nots situation where there are
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
parents where you have single families
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
single-parent families struggling and
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
those kids struggle to get a driver to
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
pay 700 dollars for a driver's ed class
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then never mind the time the parent
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
has to take to take the child to that
 
02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
has to take to take the child to that
class

02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
class
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
and they would much rather make the time
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
and teach their child and not give up
 
02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:19.430 align:start position:0%
and teach their child and not give up
both

02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
um and the school in this case said that
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass they would
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
easily see them bringing back an
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
elective to teach the rules of the road
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
class right here's the laws here's what
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
a black and white sign means here's what
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
yellow means it doesn't mean go faster
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
it means caution
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know and those kind of things they
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
would teach all the driver's ed
 
02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
would teach all the driver's ed
requirements

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
as part of the course and classroom
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
portion as part of a high school
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
elective instead right now the schools
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
don't want a they can't go near unless
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
they want to certify certified drivers
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
at instructors and b there's the whole
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
issue of driving they don't want the
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
liability of driving by allowing this
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
model that we would allow our high
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
schools to be able to bring back the
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
driver's ed book piece of this the the
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
classroom piece of this into high
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
schools for a half a credit and be able
 
02:08:02.709 --> 02:08:02.719 align:start position:0%
to allow the parents to teach the
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
practical piece
 
02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
safety is the next argument everybody
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
gives me about this bill is how we can
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that drivers on the road are safe
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
and the answer that is we already do
 
02:08:12.079 --> 02:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
and the answer that is we already do
that

02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicle gives two
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
exams you have a written exam which is
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
your basic book exam make sure you know
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
the rules of the road and if you don't
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
pass that exam number one you don't get
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
a driver's license the second one is we
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
do a practical exam so a driver's dmv
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
employee takes a citizen on the road and
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
makes them drive a vehicle if they're a
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
first-time driver to prove they can
 
02:08:33.599 --> 02:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
first-time driver to prove they can
drive

02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
drive
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
so we have two gatekeepers at this at
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
this to keep safe drivers on the road
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
these are the same gatekeepers that keep
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
keep that 18 year old who's never taken
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
driver's head off the road if he's not a
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
good driver he's never taken driver's ed
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
first-time licensee has to go through
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
that same practicum has to take the
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
written exam has to take the practical
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
exam has to pass both while they're off
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
the road your gatekeepers are right back
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
there in uniform the
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicle
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
employees that do the tests they are
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
keeping it not the drivers education
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
programs are keeping unsafe drivers they
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
may make better drivers but they don't
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
keep the unsafe ones off the road your
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
unsafe drivers are kept off the road by
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
our state agency and i my opinion is
 
02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:18.430 align:start position:0%
they do a good job
 
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
they do a good job
[Music]

02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
the one thing
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
the last piece i'll say is i think it's
 
02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
extremely important to understand that
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
this the job of the state is to make
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure we have safe drivers on the road
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's dmv's job it is not the job of
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state to make sure commercial
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
entities have a forced
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh group of citizens that must go to pay
 
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
uh group of citizens that must go to pay
700

02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
700
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
to take a class from them that's not our
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
job is to keep these entities open or
 
02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
thriving or anything else i hope they do
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
because i think there'll be plenty of
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
parents who will still opt for a
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's education program
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
but it should never be the obligation of
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
the state to say the reason we can't
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
close this loophole allow parents to do
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
this i'm afraid we won't have enough
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
driver's education programs that's not
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
our job to keep a commercial entity a
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
private commercial entity open
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
we should not be doing that as a rule
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
we should be if there's a safety issue
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
we've addressed it with dmv with the
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
testing and if we think that testing
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
needs to be more robust and that's where
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
we deal with it and the safety issue not
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
at a private commercial entity
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to take
 
02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to take
questions

02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.709 align:start position:0%
from the committee
representative

02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
question so the one of the things that
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
jumps out to me is the usage of the
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
phrase responsible adult
 
02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:36.790 align:start position:0%
phrase responsible adult
and

02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
by your own discussion an 18 year old
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
can go in on his 18th birthday and take
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
the written exam in the road exam
 
02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
without driver's ed and get their
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
license does that mean the next day they
 
02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.709 align:start position:0%
license does that mean the next day they
can

02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
go in and educate a 16 year old on all
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
the rules of the road and be the
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
responsible adult or how do you define
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
that so the requirements i think if you
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
look in the chapter it's not in this
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
section i think it's in another section
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
says that responsible adults 25 or older
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
so i get on my 29 year old teach it's
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
not in this chapter it's in the chapter
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
defining how who's allowed to do the 40
 
02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
defining how who's allowed to do the 40
hours

02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute again remember
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
some of this is already in statute the
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
40 hours is already required and that's
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
already defined what a responsible
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
person is um the amendment of one thing
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
i apologize the amendment you see in
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
front of you i forgot to give the agency
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority to be able to
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
create the forms and necessary
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
regulations they need around it so the
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
last it just changes section five and
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
adds a last line granting rulemaking
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
authority to the agency to be able to
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
create the forms i serve on jal cars so
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
i see them on a regular basis i've been
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
there for three terms
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
and they come in and you know in a law
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
like this they would need to create a
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
form or amend a form which would go
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
through rule making process and i needed
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
to give them the authority to do that so
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment's all about it
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
grants rulemaking authority to the
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
division to be able to do that
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
question so i just have this little bit
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
of a conundrum in my mind that i'm
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
trying to settle as a parent well
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
they're no longer a teenager maybe 25
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
years ago they were a teenager but as a
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
parent of a teenager
 
02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:17.890 align:start position:0%
what happens if the
 
02:12:17.890 --> 02:12:19.189 align:start position:0%
what happens if the
[Music]

02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
parent who
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully knows their child best
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
thinks that they should not
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
go for their driver's test yet
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
until they've taken a class but the
 
02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
until they've taken a class but the
child

02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:12:34.229 --> 02:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
goes out and finds that responsible
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
adult for themselves
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely you can find that answer
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
another chapter of law if i'm not
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
mistaken it's rsa
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
263 colon 19.
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's the right no i'm sorry 17
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
and what that chapter says is no one
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 get a driver's
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
license without their parents signature
 
02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:51.910 align:start position:0%
license without their parents signature
period

02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
so unless you're emancipating all the
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
other rules so so we already have that
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
in law as to what happens so that
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be addressed that's
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative hill thank you mr
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:08.470 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
question

02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
um how would would this benefit your
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
your proposal would this benefit uh
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
those students
 
02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.189 align:start position:0%
those students
that

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
are unable to afford the commercial
 
02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
are unable to afford the commercial
driving

02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
driving
 
02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
driving
school

02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
and and so they wait until they're 18
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
having no
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
driver no formal driver training and
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
then go uh take the test without ever
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
seeing any of the commercial
 
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:35.430 align:start position:0%
seeing any of the commercial
um

02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
schools any of that
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hill for the
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
question and again you know the answer
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
is yes it would help them is that again
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
at 18 you can walk in without any
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
driver's education and get your driver's
 
02:13:47.199 --> 02:13:48.310 align:start position:0%
driver's education and get your driver's
license

02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
on your birthday um you have no
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
obligation to learn anything
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
alls are doing is delaying parents and
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
children that could have an earlier
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
driver and again to the superintendent's
 
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
point that that i spoke to it is
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
definitely shows in single families
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
single parent families and and families
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
that are lower economic means
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
um have more of a struggle
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
on on their commitment of money and time
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times i used to like
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
use the argument my my brothers and
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
sisters in dealing with parents i can
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
give you money and give you time i can't
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
give you both right because it's too
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
much of a burden right to try to do both
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
of all those things and and that and i
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
think this is no different right so some
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
parents are willing to give the money
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
and send their kid off to the class and
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
take care of it because they can't give
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
the time up others have plenty of time
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
but don't have the money and this would
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
take care of both you can do it either
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
way you can provide the time you can
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
provide the money to be able to allow
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
your student to or a child to be able to
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
um get a driver's license and enter the
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
workforce sooner right again some of
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
these families that are struggling the
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
kid wants to get a a job down at the
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
mall or down at mcdonald's and this is
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
one of the ways the parents after coming
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
home from school the kid can go over and
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
work two hours or three hours but they
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
can't do that now unless the parent
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
wants to drive him to drive him there
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
driving back so
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
our this is definitely you know i look
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
at this sometimes and i i loathe to do
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
this sometimes but this is an economic
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
class issue to a certain extent that
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
economic classes pay a big part of this
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and and the the people who are on the
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
most losing side are the lower economic
 
02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:16.709 align:start position:0%
most losing side are the lower economic
class

02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:21.030 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
but i crawford i need to ask this
 
02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:24.950 align:start position:0%
but i crawford i need to ask this
question

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:25.669 align:start position:0%
question
so

02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
another responsible adult
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
could be anyone 25 years or older is
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
that correct as long as they're licensed
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
yes as long as they have a new hampshire
 
02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
license could that 25 year old adult
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
with a new hampshire driver's license
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
charge someone
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
for lessons
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
a parent doesn't have time to take their
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
kids out
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
are they going to be able to charge that
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
person is that is that 25 year old adult
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
going to be able to charge
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
that parent for the time that he's
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
putting in to teach their child how to
 
02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.270 align:start position:0%
putting in to teach their child how to
drive

02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
drive
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question i think and
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
again this is this is a little bit of a
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
leap for me because i didn't look up the
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
regulations under again
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicle the driver's
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
ed instructor which is a person who
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
receives money for driver's education is
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
regulated by the department of motor
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle they have a couple officers back
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
here that enforce that
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
looking at their rules i would i would
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that if you were
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
charging and you were for driving then
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're acting as a uh license as a
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
driver as a driver's ed instructor
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's instructor and be
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
obligated to file their follow their
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
but in our rules and regulations um only
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
a licensed uh person can charge for
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
driving instruction that's in our
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
regulations and
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
we and driver instructors have to have
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
criminal checks they have to have a
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
driving record check every three years
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
they have to have
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
50 hours of staff development hours
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
which cost money to that but if i if i
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
as a parent don't have time and i want
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
my neighbor who's a good friend of mine
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
i don't really know his driving record
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
but i want to ask him hey could you take
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
my child out for 10 hours of driving and
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'll give you 50 bucks an hour is that
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that acceptable
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
so the answer your question again i
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
think i did once but is that um if it's
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
illegal now to charge and you're not a
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
certified instructor it would still be
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
legal to charge if you're not a
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
certified instructor that doesn't change
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
so you have 40 hours now
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's obligated the parents teach
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
anybody could do exactly what you
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
defined right now and it would be in
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
violation i'm sure of the regulations um
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that that department or vehicle has
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
about about pain you know being
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
basically a commercial or professional
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
drivers instructor and you would have to
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
fall into their rules and if you didn't
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they would come after you if
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
there was something a complaint made but
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
again i don't think this law changes the
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
rules doesn't change the obligation that
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
obligation is identical as
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes versus not
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%

i'm here speaking on behalf of that
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
association in opposition to hb 1208
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has placed a
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
priority on teen driver training and has
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
developed a robust driver education
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
training program with an emphasis on
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
safety as a result there are
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 55 to 60 certified driving
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
schools in the state
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
we provide 30 hours of classroom
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
instruction 10 hours of behind the wheel
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
instruction and 6 hours of observation
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
to our students
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
currently parents are required to
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
provide an additional 40 hours of
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
practice time
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
driver educators go through extensive
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
training for their testing and state
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
certifications this combined with a
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
specially equipped car lesson plans and
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
some infinite patients provides a safe
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable environment for a
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
young teenager to begin the process of
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
becoming a competent driver in this
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation if a parent
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
guardian or other responsible adult
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
submits in writing that they have
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
provided for instruction the
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall grant a waiver
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of what that instruction
 
02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
current standards for a certified driver
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
education instructor includes passing
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
eight college courses specific to
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
teaching driver education
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
passing a 100 question written exam
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
passing a road test completion of a
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
background and driving records check
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
completion of 300 hours of supervised
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
student teaching and meeting all the
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
standards of safe c3100
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
that include providing a curriculum
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
lesson plans and route plans
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill in effect potentially makes
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
anyone with a driver's license a
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
certified driving instructor without
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
meeting any of these criteria
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
driving schools are the definition of a
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
small business and we operate on very
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
tight margins if this legislation were
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
to pass i fear it would cause a number
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
of driving schools perhaps a significant
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
number to close leaving more shortages
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
of professionals to provide traditional
 
02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:46.389 align:start position:0%
of professionals to provide traditional
instruction

02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
access to classes is an issue that the
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
industry is actively trying to address
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
the department of safety along with
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
members of the new hampshire driver

education teachers association
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
aaa and other team members are currently
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
meeting monthly with the director's
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
office to address these concerns
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
the goal is to work towards creating
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
ways to increase access to classes
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
without compromising quality instruction
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
the committee has recently submitted
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
proposals for rural changes that would
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
have significant potential to make it
 
02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
easier for students to take classes and
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
we look forward to continue this process
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the director
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire certified driving
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
instructors are the first line of

defense in promoting safety on our
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
roadways driving is the single most
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing we do on a daily basis
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
we all have licenses each of us has a
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
different definition of what a good
 
02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
driver is but i think we could all agree
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
that it's different out there now than
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
when we learn to drive it's more
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
complicated than ever we have more
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles than ever new technologies and
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
cars new roadway designs and safety
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
features and an increasing population of
 
02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:44.469 align:start position:0%
features and an increasing population of
drivers

02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
an option already exists if students do
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
not want to take driver education that
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
state the state does not require anyone
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
18 or older to take any classes as a
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
result only 16 and 17 year olds are
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
required to take driver education class
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
from a certified instructor if they wish
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
to obtain a driver's license prior to
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
their 18th birthday there is a cost to
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
taking the class but that cost is
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
recoupable in the form of discounts
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
offered by insurance companies for
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
completing an approved driver education
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
course as driving instructors we are
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
held to standards and we have taken our
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
own on our own cost of becoming an
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
approved school
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
certified driving schools provide a
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
service to a small segment of our
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
population that service is as much about
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
the overall safety of our students and
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
the general population as it is about
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
driving a motor vehicle driving schools
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
employ people who have invested
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of money and time
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
within the state to be and remain a
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
certified instructor
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
driving schools and instructors are
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
overseeing and work in concert with the
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we oppose hb 1208 and
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to find the bill and
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
expedite it to legislate and i'd be
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain any questions
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i can just make a couple
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
of points as well i heard um you know
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard this bill before this
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee has numerous times
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
and a few of the driving factors of what
 
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
and a few of the driving factors of what
has

02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
basically brought this bill forward have
 
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
basically brought this bill forward have
been

02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
access to driver's education and you
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
know the difficulty of
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
being able to drive a student to a
 
02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.150 align:start position:0%
being able to drive a student to a
course

02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
and i want to say that you know this
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee and its infinite wisdom a few
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
did modify the statute and that it now
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
allows for 15 hours of the 30 that are
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the law to be done
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
through a remote or online program and
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
those were the rules that john had just
 
02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
those were the rules that john had just
mentioned

02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
are being submitted through our work
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
with the division of motor vehicles and
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have been meeting over the course of
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
and of course the pandemic has slowed
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
some of that work down but we're back in
 
02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:46.550 align:start position:0%
some of that work down but we're back in
person

02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
getting together on what
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
parts of the curriculum can be done
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
online which will obviously create more
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
access for students
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
to the driver education program
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
another issue is the cost we certainly
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
have heard that as john mentioned you
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
know these driver education schools
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
operate on tight margins however this
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee just heard a bill right before
 
02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:09.270 align:start position:0%
committee just heard a bill right before
this

02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
about the driver training fund and i
 
02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:12.309 align:start position:0%
about the driver training fund and i
think

02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know representative almi had asked
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
that that bill be sent to interim study
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
for further work about providing um some
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement back to the student for
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
the cost as was previously done before
 
02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
the cost as was previously done before
2011

02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
2011
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i think you know that's certainly a
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism to address the cost
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
and as far as
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
the driver education program as a whole
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
last year the national highway traffic
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
safety administration conducted a robust
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
look at our driver education program in
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and offered
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
numerous recommendations and i'd be
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
happy to get a copy of that report
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee members
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
however i should note that
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
moving to a parent taught driver
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
education program was not one of their
 
02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
education program was not one of their
recommendations

02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
they had a number of recommendations
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
however this was not one of them as well
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
as reducing the number of hours behind
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
the wheel
 
02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
was not one of their recommendations
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
which this bill does by moving it from
 
02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:09.429 align:start position:0%
which this bill does by moving it from
the

02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
10 hours with the driver instructor six
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
hours observation and then 40 hours with
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
the parent guardian a responsible adult
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would just satisfy that
 
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
those hours with just 40 hours with a
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
responsible adult so we would
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
essentially be cutting back on the
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
driving time so again i hope that was
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
under two minutes but those were just
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
some supplemental comments i wanted to
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
add and we'd be happy to take any
 
02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:30.550 align:start position:0%
add and we'd be happy to take any
questions

02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.190 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
rep thompson
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
um i think it's john i apologize i don't
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
remember your last name
 
02:25:39.600 --> 02:26:05.670 align:start position:0%
remember your last name
um

02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for the question um
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
we have about as i said about 55 to 60
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
driving schools in the state there are
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
some areas that lack driving schools
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
honestly each time that
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
bills like this come up it kind of hurts
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
us in our potential to get more driving
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
schools up and going
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
but there are some schools we advise
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
everybody to sign up early because it is
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
a process and our class sizes are
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
limited to 30
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
through state rule so it's not as simple
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
as just wanting a course to being able
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
to get it it's a process of signing up
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and getting registered in the
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
correct class to get through but i would
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
think that um using my school for an
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
example there's nobody that waits more
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
than a month or two
 
02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:49.830 align:start position:0%
than a month or two
that

02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't get in and they're still within
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
their 16th birthday when they're done
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
which is also a requirement that
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
um they either have to be 15 and 9
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
months to begin the class which is a
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
something that we had proposed and got
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
through rule changes to try to alleviate
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
backlog or they have to be 16 by the
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is working if anyone has a question
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
you plugged in i guess
 
02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:14.550 align:start position:0%
you plugged in i guess
yeah

02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay sound check all right we're back um
 
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative talersky thank you thank
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um i attended
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
a driver's ed school in nashua in the
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
late 80s my children attended the same
 
02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
late 80s my children attended the same
one

02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the mid-2000s and um i've taught
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
with the assistants of the driver's ed
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
school three children how to drive in
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
the last couple years and one thing that
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
struck me is how
 
02:28:44.479 --> 02:28:45.510 align:start position:0%
struck me is how
safety

02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
has changed in those 25 years and the
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
prime example is the hand position on
 
02:28:50.950 --> 02:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
the wheel
 
02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.070 align:start position:0%
the wheel
which

02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
or the simple act of turning the wheel
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the proper way to protect yourself
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
which my 16 year olds told me i was
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
doing completely wrong and i had the uh
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
risk of injuring myself um with the way
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
i drive
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
technology changing and safety
 
02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
tactics or approaches to driving is
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
does change regularly enough that if
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
we have adults who haven't had
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
up-to-date safety training on driving
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
that could pose a risk to
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
a whole generation of
 
02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:32.309 align:start position:0%
a whole generation of
drivers

02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
and you give me a chance to put my
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
teacher hat on which excites me so
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think we all would teach what we
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
learned back 20 to 25 years ago and
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
technology is extremely
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
advanced in cars nowadays so
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
i start off
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
with um the kids in the car
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
with did you know that you have to
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
connect electronically with your car to
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
make the the airbags and brand new cars
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
work properly for you and they're like
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
do i take my phone out no you plug your
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
seat belt in and then
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
that seat monitors where you put your
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
seat um how much you weigh and it'll
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
deploy airbags now in the on the newest
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
of cars at different levels for
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
different sized people because it wants
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
to help you not hurt you
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
hand position as you talked about we
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
teach nine o'clock three o'clock instead
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
of ten two and shuffle steering instead
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
of hand over hand because of airbags and
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
how fast airbags come out we talk about
 
02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know 40 milliseconds and an airbag
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
is completely inflated in front of you
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's an explosion
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
so having you know the car
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
um you know and i tell them there's one
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
thing faster than in your car than
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
than your airbag and that's your
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
seatbelt actuator and pretension are
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
firing and tightening you to the seat
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
before the airbag goes off
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
so i would worry that parents you know
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know what is stability assist
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
how does it really work traction control
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
anti-lock brakes you know we were talk i
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
was taught as a kid pump your brakes
 
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
when it starts to you know lock up and
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
slide and that's not what new cars are
 
02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
designed to do anymore so i would think
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
certainly a challenge for parents to
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
keep up with all the technology
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
that that new cars have to offer and and
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that we do in our field
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
is keep up with the with the new stuff
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%

hampshire and vermont and before i get
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
into it i just want to
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
piggyback on what john was talking about
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
with driver ed teachers and
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
how what they teach kids is always
 
02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:54.469 align:start position:0%
how what they teach kids is always
evolving

02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
evolving
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
john's curriculum the schools in new
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire their curriculum what they're
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
teaching students is always changing
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
from distracted driving to vehicle
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
technology to impaired driving these
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
instructors go through
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
a vigorous
 
02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:09.510 align:start position:0%
a vigorous
onboarding

02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
onboarding
 
02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:10.550 align:start position:0%
onboarding
and

02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
and they go to numerous conferences and
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
they're always trying to update the
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
information they that they teach
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
students so um
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite incredible um but i
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
should have started by saying i'm in
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to this as the chairman said
 
02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:23.670 align:start position:0%
opposition to this as the chairman said
um

02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire and throughout
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
the country we're kind of in this this
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
trend where less kids are taking drive
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
red while vehicle crashes remain the
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
number one killer of teen drivers we
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
know teen drivers are
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
overrepresented in
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
crashes you know there's
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
so we know teen drivers are also three
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
times more likely to die in a fatal
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
crash than an adult driver
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
we also know
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of people injured or killed
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
in a crash involving cane driver other
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
than that teen driver
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
so that's that's
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
um not great uh we know that you know
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
there are most vulnerable drivers out
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
there they need the best education
 
02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:04.950 align:start position:0%
there they need the best education
possible

02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
and have being involved in instruction
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
with a professional instructor is vital
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
i only know of one study that has looked
 
02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:14.790 align:start position:0%
i only know of one study that has looked
at

02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
a state that offers parent driver
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
education and then they analyze that
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
verse the students who took driver edge
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
with a professional instructor and i was
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
at the texas transportations too i
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
apologize and this research determined
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
that teenagers taught to drive by
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
someone other than the professional
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
driver instructor are more likely to be
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
convicted of driving violations
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
including speeding and more likely to be
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
involved in serious crashes
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
they also found that parent taught
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
drivers are nearly three times more
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
likely to be involved in a fatal crash
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
than our young drivers taught by
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
commercial or public school driver
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
instructors so
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's pretty scary
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we know it
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned parents play a
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
crucial part in dry vacation in new
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire as was mentioned
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
they have to do 40 hours before they get
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
their license that's a that's a key role
 
02:34:08.950 --> 02:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
but the professional driver instructor
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
is also a very very key role that we
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to take out and i'm concerned
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
that this would pose a serious risk to
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
not just the teen driver but other users
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
every root user on the road so with that
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in opposition to this bill and
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
they let you off the hook thank you
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
lieutenant james o'leary representing
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety state police
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
did not say one way or the other if he
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
supports or opposes the bill but i
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
would imagine he will in a moment
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
i was going to keep that part of sega
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman members of the
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee morning we do oppose the bill
 
02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
committee morning we do oppose the bill
the

02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much all the points have been
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
made so i won't
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
waste any of your time with with
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
reiterating the things that people said
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
before me
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
but as it relates to the waiver process
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh right now when somebody comes from
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
out of state to transfer their driver
 
02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
education program to the state of new
 
02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:14.870 align:start position:0%
education program to the state of new
hampshire

02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
we are required to essentially review
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
the education that person received from
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
that state to make sure that it is
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
comparable to what the new hampshire
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
standards and curriculum speak to
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
in doing that it's a time consuming
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
process because depending on the state
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
we have to research essentially what
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
they are requirements are and what they
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
are teaching state law requires in new
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire that we speak to 45 minutes of
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
motorcycle safety awareness as well as
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
45 minutes dedicated to driving around
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
trucks so we have to make sure that
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
those programs
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
or that time has been met from out of
 
02:35:47.439 --> 02:35:48.230 align:start position:0%
or that time has been met from out of
state

02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
the reason i speak to that is
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
in looking at
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
what the waiver process would look like
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
the language the way that it's suggested
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
now would have an impact on our office
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
as we would effectively have to review
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
each one of these waivers and we just
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
currently don't have the staff to be
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
able to to do that so that's how it
 
02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
would affect
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
we obviously have concerns that each one
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
of those waivers would represent a
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
different methodology or of teaching
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
with different driving experiences and
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge of law potentially poor
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
driving habits and all those things that
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
follow through that everybody spoke to
 
02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
follow through that everybody spoke to
before

02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's our belief that the
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
instruction provided by our driver
 
02:36:28.389 --> 02:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
educators allow for a quality program uh
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
being delivered by trained and certified
 
02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.349 align:start position:0%
being delivered by trained and certified
instructors

02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
instructors
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we stand on that if
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's any questions i'd be happy to
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
answer them right thank you question
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
did i see a hand
 
02:36:41.439 --> 02:36:43.590 align:start position:0%
did i see a hand
no

02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:44.389 align:start position:0%
no
okay

02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
i guess there are no questions thank you
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
very much thank you sir
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's the last person i have signed
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
up to speak on the bill is anybody else
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
that wishes to
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will close the public
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1208 fn
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
and before everybody leaves
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh the bills that we've scheduled that
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
i've scheduled today uh are our early
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
bills the meeting that i went to earlier
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
was to
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
find out that we actually are shortening
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
up the schedule a little bit
 
02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
up the schedule a little bit
um

02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
for these early bills other than what
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
you see posted
 
02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
you see posted

we have an opportunity we've got 25
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%

02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
one or two of these
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
and just start getting these processed
 
02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that we are going to run out of
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
time sooner than later so give us a few

being distributed and there's a lot of
 
02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved in this and so i
 
02:52:15.429 --> 02:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
believe interim study would be a good
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
way for us to
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
take a further in-depth look at the
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll have an opportunity
 
02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
to talk to more of the stakeholders
 
02:52:27.429 --> 02:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
and therefore would urge us to vote yes
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%

start off chair recognizes marie mullen
 
04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
from the department of transportation in
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
04:03:28.229 --> 04:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
name's marie mullen i'm the director of
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
finance for the new hampshire department
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
of transportation
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
um and we oppose this bill
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
primarily because of the erosion of the
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
highway fund revenue we're seeing due to
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiency
 
04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
we we have a study that was done by
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
cambridge systematics a few years ago
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the fuel efficiency the adoption of
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles hybrid vehicles
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we're has projected to see a one
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
percent decline in revenue per year
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
over the next
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know over the future 10 plus years
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so we're concerned that diverting
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
this revenue
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
to terrible organizations will continue
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
to hamper the highway fund and be able
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr mullen for taking my
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
question just to kind of clarify i just
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
was going through this
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
how much of the revenue would be lost if
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
this was passed
 
04:04:37.830 --> 04:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i believe the department of safety
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
the department of safety collects the
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
revenue so it's in the fiscal note
 
04:04:41.920 --> 04:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
revenue so it's in the fiscal note
um

04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
going out into 2024 once you see a full
 
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
year it looks like about 9.2 million to
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
make sure okay thank you
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%

04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
next up
 
04:04:58.960 --> 04:05:03.269 align:start position:0%
next up
um

04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
mary ann ducey
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
how'd i do
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
close from the new hampshire judicial
 
04:05:12.790 --> 04:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
branch uh
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the bill at
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
this point thank
 
04:05:15.600 --> 04:05:17.030 align:start position:0%
this point thank
thank you

04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
ah dempsey thank you
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record my
 
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
name is marianne dempsey i'm general
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
counsel for the judicial branch
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
um you will see that we prepared a
 
04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note in connection with this bill
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
and it's because the language of the
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
bill is unclear as to whether the
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
donation of fines includes the penalty
 
04:05:47.359 --> 04:05:48.790 align:start position:0%
donation of fines includes the penalty
assessment

04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
for each motor vehicle violation by
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
statute there's a penalty assessment
 
04:05:53.680 --> 04:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
statute there's a penalty assessment
that

04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
ensues and that gets split amongst
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
a number of different
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
groups including the general fund but we
 
04:06:03.429 --> 04:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
receive a portion through the i.t
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for our i.t services so
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass we would estimate a
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
revenue loss of approximately 1.2
 
04:06:12.319 --> 04:06:13.269 align:start position:0%
revenue loss of approximately 1.2
million

04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:06:13.279 --> 04:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
million
dollars

04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would make note in the
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill is just that it doesn't
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism by which the court
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
would be notified of a payment to a
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
charity so
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
when somebody
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle violation is brought the
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
person either please by mail or comes
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
into the court so without a notice to
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
the court that that has been satisfied
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
it could also be problematic in terms of
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
individuals being found not to have paid
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh you talking
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
about the penalty assessment is that
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
still 20 one-fifth of the fine it i
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
think it depends on the nature of the
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
fine representative it's the statute um
 
04:07:00.479 --> 04:07:02.309 align:start position:0%
fine representative it's the statute um
is

04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh 106 hyphen l colon 10 but i think it
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
depends it's a proportion of the fine so
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
i think it depends on the amount um but
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
for for our excuse me we we estimate
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
that the penalty assessment loss would
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
be 1.2 million per year in total thank
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further questions
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%

next up
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety dmv
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
brittany and you have to help me out is
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%

yeah welcome
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill
 
04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is brittany shu i
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
am the administrator of the bureau of
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility at the division
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
of motor vehicles and we are testifying
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill just like dot
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the judicial branch has pointed out
 
04:07:59.110 --> 04:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts there are both
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures and revenues that would be
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
lost and incurred through this process
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
additionally the legislation is unclear
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
as to how this will be administered and
 
04:08:14.790 --> 04:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
practiced such as how do we dictate to
 
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
the 503cs about
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
who can pay what can be paid what can't
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
be paid
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
does this impact an individual's driver
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
privacy by paying penalties through a
 
04:08:25.040 --> 04:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
privacy by paying penalties through a
charity

04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
charity
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
and will the division be tasked with
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
going back and verifying such payments
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're monetary
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
or in exchange a different value
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
clothing furniture any sort of donation
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
to that charity
 
04:08:40.149 --> 04:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
additionally it's unclear through this
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation if it's fines pursuant to a
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle such as unregistered
 
04:08:46.239 --> 04:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle such as unregistered
uninspected

04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
uninspected
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
headlights tail lights any of those type
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
violations or whether it would also be
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
inclusive of mobile devices speeding
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
and other violations that a driver can
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
be charged with under title 21
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to take any
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%

software to change the fine schedule
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
will there be additional funds needed on

include our notices it would cost about
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
175 000 dollars to modify our database
 
04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%

well mr chairman i think it's pretty
 
04:14:07.520 --> 04:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
well mr chairman i think it's pretty
self-explanatory

04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
all i look is the uh fiscal note here
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
and you know this state can't afford to
 
04:14:17.110 --> 04:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
lose any of this money so
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's why i move make the motion for
 
04:14:18.880 --> 04:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
that's why i move make the motion for
itl

04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
fair enough any further discussion
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i will concur uh when we have these
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
these bills with such large fiscal notes
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's nice to see an attempt to
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
maybe find the money in a different
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
place and this bill did not do that so i
 
04:14:36.000 --> 04:14:37.030 align:start position:0%
place and this bill did not do that so i
also

04:14:37.030 --> 04:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the itl
 
04:14:39.680 --> 04:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the itl
any

04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman yeah so i'm in
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
support of the itl because
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon us as a committee
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
particularly a policy committee to know
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
how things are actually going to work
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
and there's so many questions about this
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill that it's just not it's not ready
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%

04:32:17.110 --> 04:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
audible uh my name is representative max
 
04:32:19.030 --> 04:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
abramson i'm representing uh hampton
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
hampton falls and seabrook and i'm
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
introducing this which i think is
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
probably one of the simplest bills
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
of the session it's
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with a hardship
 
04:32:30.080 --> 04:32:31.590 align:start position:0%
to deal with a hardship
situation

04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:32:31.600 --> 04:32:32.469 align:start position:0%
situation
that

04:32:32.469 --> 04:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh folks especially older folks
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the state encounter when they need to
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh go in and renew their their uh their
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
driver's license they're valid for five
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
years and so it's uh
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like much when it's ten
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
dollars a year but it's uh it's a 50
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
renewal fee and for folks both on fixed
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
incomes and for a lot of working poor in
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
our state it's actually
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
it can be a a sudden um
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
a sudden expense that they couldn't
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
afford so i was speaking with a
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
public school bus driver
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
who lives down the street from me and
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
she said
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the rules of the road have changed
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit over the years for drivers
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
and it might be useful to have people go
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
in and just retake the written test
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
every every so often and so i i thought
 
04:33:18.561 --> 04:33:19.269 align:start position:0%
every every so often and so i i thought
of

04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
bringing these two ideas together as a
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
way to kind of incentivize that
 
04:33:23.119 --> 04:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
way to kind of incentivize that
um

04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
i'm aware that there's a a fiscal note
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
and it's based on a rough estimate i
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
don't agree with either either side of
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on this
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
that uh the vast majority of people who
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
go in and restudy for the written test
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
another 40 or 45 minutes i think to
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
retake the written test it's been a long
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
time since i've taken the test myself as
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact i hate to admit that
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
the rules of the road have changed since
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
i moved to new hampshire over 20 years
 
04:33:56.000 --> 04:33:56.949 align:start position:0%
i moved to new hampshire over 20 years
ago

04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:33:56.959 --> 04:33:58.190 align:start position:0%
ago
and

04:33:58.190 --> 04:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:58.200 --> 04:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
and

04:34:01.760 --> 04:34:01.770 align:start position:0%
we have quite a few drivers who
 
04:34:01.770 --> 04:34:03.029 align:start position:0%
we have quite a few drivers who
[Music]

04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
either don't know that they're supposed
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
or when the buses used to stop on route
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
1 which is is five lanes wide they don't
 
04:34:12.070 --> 04:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
do that anymore where i live but they'll
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
stop and put the the stop sign out and
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
people on the opposite side of the road
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
will actually stop and stop traffic
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
because people don't know
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
what the stop sign means how how uh
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
the fl in the fro flashing red lights
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
what they mean
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
when a school bus comes to a stop it's
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
only stopping the traffic right next to
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
the bus in that particular direction
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's only stopping traffic in two lanes
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
another one of course is
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
people not understanding how to use the
 
04:34:47.109 --> 04:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
turn lane properly and there are quite a
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
few accidents
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
that happen on our roads and highways
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
because people don't understand
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
that it's the turn lane is something
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
that you turn into and you turn out of a
 
04:34:59.189 --> 04:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
number of times i've turned into the
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
turn lane and come almost to a complete
 
04:35:01.520 --> 04:35:02.629 align:start position:0%
turn lane and come almost to a complete
stop

04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
stop
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
and someone coming the other way
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
where i wasn't even turning into their
 
04:35:07.760 --> 04:35:08.629 align:start position:0%
where i wasn't even turning into their
lane

04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
lane
 
04:35:08.639 --> 04:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
lane
will

04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
honk and screech and one
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
woman almost went off the road because
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
she didn't understand how the turn lanes
 
04:35:16.080 --> 04:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
she didn't understand how the turn lanes
worked

04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
worked
 
04:35:17.760 --> 04:35:18.709 align:start position:0%
worked
so

04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
the driver's licensing fee we have a
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
tendency to talk about it in terms of
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
revenue but the argument for drivers
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
licensing is that it's supposed to make
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
the roads and highways safer
 
04:35:31.510 --> 04:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the reality of of course is
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
that uh there have been a number of
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
studies that come out showing that
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
people who get a driver's license are
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually more likely to cause an
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
accident and people have never bothered
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
to get a driver's license at all
 
04:35:41.920 --> 04:35:42.179 align:start position:0%
to get a driver's license at all
so

04:35:42.179 --> 04:35:42.189 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:42.189 --> 04:35:43.830 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

04:35:43.830 --> 04:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion we have to revise the
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
whole process
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
so that people at a minimum know the
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
rules of the road and that we
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
do suspend people's licenses
 
04:35:53.920 --> 04:35:55.029 align:start position:0%
do suspend people's licenses
um

04:35:55.029 --> 04:35:55.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
at least for driving at night if they're
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
if they're driving recklessly
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
or if they're
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
if they're causing multiple accidents
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
that that on on one hand we've been
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
making the case to the public that
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses are supposed to
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
improve road safety and and keep the
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
occasional really bad driver off the
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
road or at least reform them so that
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
they drive a little bit more safely
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
on the other hand i believe that we're
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
duty bound to offer some type of
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
hardship provision and i don't
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
i don't like the idea of having people
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
go to their bank
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
and get
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
bring back statements from their bank
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
bring back pay stubs and everything else
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
that we do with
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know community action in the town
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
welfare office and so forth to prove a
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
hardship i think that it would be
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient just to have them reset for
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
the test
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
um and demonstrate a hardship that way
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
the way that most other states have
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
addressed this is simply by keeping the
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license renewal fee low
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
quite a few states simply have renewal
 
04:36:59.590 --> 04:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
rather than having the higher fifty
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
dollar fee
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:37:04.400 --> 04:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
and uh
that

04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
that would also work in my opinion but i
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
think that that for for people who are
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
kind of struggling to make ends meet
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
that there has to be a hardship
 
04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
provision that's offered at the time
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
that licenses are are renewed and i
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's a mistake to
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
continue to let drivers
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
for financial reason either drive
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
without a drive with an expired driver's
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
license or not be able to drive at all
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
the state loses a lot of jobs and a lot
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
of revenue and a lot of jobs go unfilled
 
04:37:36.719 --> 04:37:37.670 align:start position:0%
of revenue and a lot of jobs go unfilled
because

04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
people hit that point where they need to
 
04:37:41.429 --> 04:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
renew their driver's license they just
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
financially are not able to afford it
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i think that the
 
04:37:47.990 --> 04:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill is a good idea
 
04:37:50.230 --> 04:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
i the second part of the fiscal note
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
that i disagreed with was the additional
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
testing facilities i think that it's
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
that there's already a mechanism in
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
place for brand new drivers
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
to uh to sit for the written test and i
 
04:38:01.520 --> 04:38:02.789 align:start position:0%
to uh to sit for the written test and i
i

04:38:02.789 --> 04:38:02.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
i think although very few people would
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
actually take advantage of this
 
04:38:08.310 --> 04:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh the few people who do it i think
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
would just be using the existing
 
04:38:10.080 --> 04:38:11.830 align:start position:0%
would just be using the existing
facilities

04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
taking the in the
 
04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
driver's manual studying it and and
 
04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
sitting for the test the same way a new
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
driver would
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:38:22.080 --> 04:38:24.551 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:38:24.551 --> 04:38:24.561 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
so was your intention here to
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
to not create a hardship for those
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
people or to
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
educate them i i
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
not sure we can have it both ways i
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
my concern is and i took my driving test
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
before you were born
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and there were 10 questions that were
 
04:38:51.510 --> 04:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
very easy in a five minute driving test
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if where
 
04:38:56.310 --> 04:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're putting people at risk of not
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
being able to get a license renewal
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
because they can't answer questions
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
they've not had to answer for 40 years
 
04:39:04.639 --> 04:39:06.150 align:start position:0%
they've not had to answer for 40 years
well

04:39:06.150 --> 04:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
people like that if they don't know what
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
the rules of the road are i'm leery
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
about them
 
04:39:12.470 --> 04:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
driving at all maybe instead of maybe
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
instead of a fifty dollar fee no one
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
should be able to just pay the fifty
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
dollar renewal fee everyone should have
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
to retake the test when i took the test
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
in washington
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
oh this was a long time ago
 
04:39:24.240 --> 04:39:25.750 align:start position:0%
oh this was a long time ago
uh

04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
i think it was
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
it took me almost an hour to get through
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
the test i did score 96
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
but there were quite a few people who
 
04:39:32.799 --> 04:39:34.949 align:start position:0%
but there were quite a few people who
just

04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know they would have to retake the
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
test like three times and they would
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
i mean so mine my intent is to get
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
people to study my intent is first offer
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
sorry first to offer a hardship
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
provision if people are facing a
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
hardship that they can still get their
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license renewed and then
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
secondly i'd also like to get people to
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
actually study the the purpose of
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
driver's licensing is is literally to
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
make the roads safer and this is a it's
 
04:40:04.150 --> 04:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
a small way to do it
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
um that would get at least a few people
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh actually cracking open the book and
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
learning what the new rules of the road
 
04:40:10.560 --> 04:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
learning what the new rules of the road
are

04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir great further
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative hill
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
i'm gathering this as a voluntary
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
option so
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
so a person could decide to pay the fee
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
or they could decide to take the written
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
test and not pay a fee
 
04:40:29.280 --> 04:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
test and not pay a fee
um

04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess my questions are if someone
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
takes the option to take the written
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
test and they fail
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
do they then have the option to just pay
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
the fee and and get their license back
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
or are they on this path now that they
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to pass that test before they get
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
their license no there's there's nothing
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill that would um
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
that would address that so if you
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody did take the test and they
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
completely failed it they would still be
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
able to pay the fifty dollar fee just as
 
04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
they're able to right now
 
04:41:01.360 --> 04:41:02.150 align:start position:0%
they're able to right now
so

04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know my my preference is if we're
 
04:41:06.310 --> 04:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to have driver's licenses and
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to assure the drivers that
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
people are safe to drive on the road i
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
would have everybody retake the written
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
test every at least every you know 10 or
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
15 years but we don't require that right
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
now we just say pay the 50 fee and
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're back on the road
 
04:41:19.520 --> 04:41:20.470 align:start position:0%
you're back on the road
and

04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:20.480 --> 04:41:21.750 align:start position:0%
and
now

04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
if this committee would like to change
 
04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
that and say well if you fail the test
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
you have to re-do it until you pass the
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
test that that that would be one thing
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
but that's not what the effect of the
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill is the bill just offers uh
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know a study and retake
 
04:41:35.280 --> 04:41:36.868 align:start position:0%
uh you know a study and retake
alternative

04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up please follow up thank you
 
04:41:39.440 --> 04:41:40.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up please follow up thank you
so

04:41:40.470 --> 04:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
the bill is silent on that but what what
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
would you ideally like to have happen if
 
04:41:45.200 --> 04:41:47.110 align:start position:0%
would you ideally like to have happen if
someone

04:41:47.110 --> 04:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:41:47.120 --> 04:41:48.628 align:start position:0%
someone
um

04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
if if someone fails that exam you you
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
would like them to continue to have to
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
keep taking it but you don't say that in
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill well i don't know what would
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
happen i don't think that would have a
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
chance of
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
passing in reality but i i
 
04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
personally if you're asking my opinion i
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
think that every 10 or 15 years everyone
 
04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
should have to retake the written test i
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
guess when i'm i follow
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm asking is
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
what happens if this were to pass and
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
someone fails that test then they can
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
just pay the 50 fee right like they do
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so it wouldn't help in
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
that circumstance but at least they
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
would read the at least they'd be
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
reading the instruction manual they'd be
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
learning a little more material at least
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
representative tillerson
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative abramson i love the
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
idea of trying to help those who are
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
not able to pay to get their license
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
however i'm concerned
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
that i don't see anything that
 
04:42:54.638 --> 04:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
that i don't see anything that
prevents

04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
just someone
 
04:42:59.590 --> 04:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
going to do it to save the fifty dollars
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
i can see that the fiscal note as we all
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
have seen is quite quite extensive so
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
is there any concept of how to control
 
04:43:10.878 --> 04:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
is there any concept of how to control
um

04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
the number of people who could take
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of it yeah basically somebody
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
who makes 300 or 400 or 500 a day is not
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
likely to take a half a day off of work
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
you know get the driver's manual spend
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
an hour studying and and then take
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
another 45 minutes or an hour to retake
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
the test you'd lose you'd lose half a
 
04:43:32.240 --> 04:43:33.430 align:start position:0%
the test you'd lose you'd lose half a
day

04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make sense for them to
 
04:43:34.798 --> 04:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make sense for them to
lose

04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
lose
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
you know potentially two or three
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in income just to avoid
 
04:43:40.230 --> 04:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
a fifty dollar fee
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
mostly disabled
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
people on fixed income low income
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
elderly uh working poor people who are
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
making you know 10 12 15 an hour who
 
04:43:52.150 --> 04:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
be considering this because you have to
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
if if
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
i have to take a half a day of work off
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
most people if they have to take a half
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
a day of work off just to go re take
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
this test it's a hundred or two hundred
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
dollars in lost income so it isn't it
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
isn't economically worth it for them it
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
is for the unemployed it is for the
 
04:44:11.200 --> 04:44:14.550 align:start position:0%
is for the unemployed it is for the
disabled

04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
i i've got to ask a couple myself then
 
04:44:20.638 --> 04:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
i i've got to ask a couple myself then
um

04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
i mean i appreciate what you're doing
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's actually a pretty creative way of
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
taking care of a couple of issues that
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
you've identified however i think it's
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
kind of problematic based on some of the
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions to try to relate them
 
04:44:33.600 --> 04:44:34.868 align:start position:0%
questions to try to relate them
together

04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's just a statement in terms of a
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
question you said you disagreed with the
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
because you don't expect many people
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
would do it but would you agree that as
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
a committee when we make these decisions
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
that we should look at the worst case
 
04:44:48.718 --> 04:44:49.830 align:start position:0%
that we should look at the worst case
scenario

04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
which is what i read this fiscal note as
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
being because it said could when up to
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the worst case scenario of
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
people you know maximizing and using
 
04:45:01.030 --> 04:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
this do you agree that it's probably
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
accurate if everybody did it
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
i did
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh now
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
i just got the the bill i was told that
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
there is estimating that something like
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
15 percent of drivers wouldn't
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
15 percent of drivers would prefer to
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.230 --> 04:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what the methodology
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's realistic that a
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
large number of people would use it but
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that a large number of
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
people use it even if we did lose even
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
if the state did lose some revenue
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
if most people or a large number of
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
people would actually go re-study the
 
04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
rules of the road and then also retake
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
the test and pass the test
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh most people would pass the written
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
test if they studied for it
 
04:45:44.798 --> 04:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
test if they studied for it
um

04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
expect that there would be a large
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
loss in revenue i don't i don't think in
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
other words i don't think that this
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be a huge success i don't think
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
that you'd have
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
coming in and taking advantage of this i
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
think that maybe a few hundred people
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
based on that i'll leave it alone
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:23.670 --> 04:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh the only pink card i have uh brittany
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.670 --> 04:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm here on behalf of the department
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
as we're opposed to this bill as well
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um as you can see there is pretty
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
significant revenue impact along with
 
04:46:46.320 --> 04:46:47.990 align:start position:0%
significant revenue impact along with
significant

04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures to the department
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
between programming our database system
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
dmv recently modernized our database
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 so a lot of what we do
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
has been programmed automatically
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
depending on the transaction types for
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
individuals that come in to process a
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
transaction between capturing their data
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
capturing their information so that way
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
the customer has a better experience at
 
04:47:09.990 --> 04:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
dmv we would need to reprogram our
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
system to meet
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
the details of this legislation
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
additionally with the staffing
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
to kind of address the question about
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
testing stations it's not so much
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
establishing a physical location it's
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
more or less having the right equipment
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
at each of the locations
 
04:47:29.110 --> 04:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
should there be a demand to increase
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
testing we have automated testing
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
systems again
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
these systems are contracted through a
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
vendor they're offered testing in seven
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
different languages so if we need to
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
have more testing stations available
 
04:47:42.628 --> 04:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs for those who opt to
 
04:47:44.550 --> 04:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
do the testing rather than pay their
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
license renewal fees we need to have
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
more of those stations available
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
more stations equal more testers equal
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
more staffing that we would need to have
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
to support those because each time a
 
04:47:55.200 --> 04:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
to support those because each time a
person

04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
has a question they can hit the help
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
button and one of our staff members go
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
back and try to help with that situation
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
so everyone has a good fair opportunity
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
while taking their test
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
additionally if we have more testing we
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
have our fixed locations a lot of them
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
in which we have been at for quite a
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
long time we'd have to change the fit up
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
to accommodate more of those testing
 
04:48:15.600 --> 04:48:17.350 align:start position:0%
to accommodate more of those testing
stations

04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
stations
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
whether expanding the testing rooms the
 
04:48:19.120 --> 04:48:20.310 align:start position:0%
whether expanding the testing rooms the
size

04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
size
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
shifting around the offices so we if we
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
go from four stations to five stations
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
six stations ten stations whatever that
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
number might be
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to the fiscal impacts we
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
have concerns on the administration of
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation representative hill
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
brought up a very good point what
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
happens if a person does fail the test
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
will they be allowed to pay that fifty
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
dollar fee again you'd have to stop that
 
04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
transaction go to a different
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
transaction type
 
04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
and how many times can a person fail
 
04:48:48.560 --> 04:48:49.670 align:start position:0%
and how many times can a person fail
before

04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
they are not eligible again if we're
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
talking about safety of the roadways if
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're repetitiously failing those
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
tests are they fit to be a driver but we
 
04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
say they can turn around and end up
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
so as a department what is our
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility when that comes down if
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation does pass
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
it says that the director shall drop
 
04:49:08.638 --> 04:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
it says that the director shall drop
rules

04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
so then we would have to change the
 
04:49:12.550 --> 04:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rule set on driver
 
04:49:12.560 --> 04:49:13.750 align:start position:0%
administrative rule set on driver
licensing

04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have to take into consideration
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
path a b and c or additionally redefine
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
that rule set which again
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process it can take
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
a while to get through that to ensure
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
that it does meet the business needs and
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
the practice and the intent of the
 
04:49:29.040 --> 04:49:31.750 align:start position:0%
the practice and the intent of the
legislation

04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
generally it's unclear
 
04:49:33.920 --> 04:49:35.110 align:start position:0%
generally it's unclear
it's

04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
fiscally impactful to
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
the department and the state with that
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to take your questions
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
although i am not well worth well versed
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
in the driver licensing realm i'll take
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
your questions if there's nothing i can
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
answer then i'll be happy to get those
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
answers for you
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
04:49:56.788 --> 04:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking uh my question
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
i um
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether the department has any thoughts
 
04:50:03.120 --> 04:50:04.390 align:start position:0%
whether the department has any thoughts
or

04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:50:06.788 --> 04:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
other states have any thoughts about the
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
the point that representative abrasion
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
made about
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
information going stale
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the information that i had when i
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
got my driver's license
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
probably is not
 
04:50:23.830 --> 04:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
fresh any longer
 
04:50:23.840 --> 04:50:24.708 align:start position:0%
fresh any longer
so

04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
aside from a program like this what what
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
other type of
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
idea does the department have for
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
updating the the knowledge base that we
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
have as drivers
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question
 
04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
i know that we work closely with the
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
american association of motor vehicle
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
administrators amba and we always try to
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
find the best practices and the best
 
04:50:48.550 --> 04:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
ways to keep our roadways safe i think
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question that i'll
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
take forth to my management to ensure
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
where we stand with those
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
question i had when you when you were
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
speaking about uh physical locations in
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
order to to make this happen i know
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
um with boating licenses where uh people
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
are able to take uh the boating exam
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
online um so i'm wondering if something
 
04:51:16.708 --> 04:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
like that um
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
system that currently is in place
 
04:51:19.360 --> 04:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
system that currently is in place
um

04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't be adopted for
 
04:51:22.320 --> 04:51:23.670 align:start position:0%
couldn't be adopted for
allowing

04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of an approach so that someone
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
could take that same exam online and
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
have that applied towards their license
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that i think we would have
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
to look um very closely at that because
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
there is opportunity where there's
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
online there is opportunity if it's not
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
being monitored by officials there is
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
that potential that a different person
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
could take that test there's a
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
possibility that they have the manual
 
04:51:49.110 --> 04:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
open while they're taking that test and
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to test people to ensure
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
that our roadways are safe
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
we would have to explore the risk versus
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have one if you don't mind i'm going
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
to go where i was going to with the
 
04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
previous speaker
 
04:52:09.270 --> 04:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
because for me obviously it's the fiscal
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
note that i'm looking at
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
you you did well explaining all the
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
expenditures in terms of the testing
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
stations etc can you go a little deeper
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
into your methodology with the revenue
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the decrease in revenue of what's it
 
04:52:22.320 --> 04:52:23.190 align:start position:0%
and the decrease in revenue of what's it
saying

04:52:23.190 --> 04:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
13 million to possibly 15
 
04:52:27.670 --> 04:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
million 600
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
000 can you just explain where that was
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
driven from or drive from thank you for
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
that question
 
04:52:34.550 --> 04:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
i do not think i would be able to
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
intelligently speak to that in totality
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
um again i'm filling in for the person
 
04:52:40.390 --> 04:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
that was here
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be here today but if we
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
took every single person in the state of
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire who opted to do
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
the testing in lieu of paying the
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
renewal fees depending on their
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
licensure type whether it's a driver's
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
license or whether it's a real id
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
that is where that impact is going to
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
come from so if we have 260 000 licenses
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
a year and at 50 to 85 depending on the
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
licensure type that is your potential
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
impact okay so it's the number if
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody did it
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
based upon 260 000 licenses
 
04:53:15.030 --> 04:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much thank you i have
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
no other people signed up to speak on
 
04:53:21.990 --> 04:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill one last call is there anybody
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%

05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
05:02:32.708 --> 05:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my bill this got
 
05:02:34.470 --> 05:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
to do with the permitting process for
 
05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
the motorcycles permit
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh this was something that bro was
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention from one of the
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
online forums where a lady who was
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
on the motorcycle license um
 
05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
went through the course registered for
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
the course which was
 
05:02:55.350 --> 05:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
a little ways off because there is a
 
05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
line for the course she went through the
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
course she went through the training she
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
went to take the test
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
and she made a mistake and she failed
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
the test
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
so she wanted to practice some more but
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
her trouble was that the permit chapter
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
ain't expired because it was right
 
05:03:11.920 --> 05:03:13.110 align:start position:0%
ain't expired because it was right
um

05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:15.270 --> 05:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
during the summer rainy season the
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
unusual rainy season that we had all of
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
july and part of june that you couldn't
 
05:03:20.240 --> 05:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
july and part of june that you couldn't
ride

05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
ride
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
and practice
 
05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
so the permit that she obtained
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
initially was kind of useless to her
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
because she worked and and the few
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
weekends she had it rained hard and i it
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
probably is not a good idea for
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
a newbie to be out in the rain trying to
 
05:03:39.510 --> 05:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
learn the skill
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
so so what i'm trying to solve here with
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is a simple
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling issue where people can come
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
back and request a renewal to the permit
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
so they can have more time to practice
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
when she posted it online a bunch of
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
other people chimed in saying yeah they
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
ran into the same issue it was
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
troublesome it was probably not the
 
05:04:06.550 --> 05:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
doing business so i think for our
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
citizens sake and for safety's sake i
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
want people to practice as much as
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
possible before they actually get on the
 
05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
i i would like this bill passed
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
so the the options after she
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
explained to the people online and i i
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
had communications with her afterwards
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh the options that some people were
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
giving her was one option was find a
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
trailer find some private property tow
 
05:04:37.030 --> 05:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
your bike to the property and practice
 
05:04:37.040 --> 05:04:37.830 align:start position:0%
your bike to the property and practice
there

05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
because you cannot get a permit for the
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
roads even back roads anywhere somebody
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
else said enroll in another class which
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
is the intermediate level or the next
 
05:04:46.470 --> 05:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
advanced level and she said that she
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
tried but again it was a scheduling
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
issue so they were pushed out a couple
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
weeks or maybe a month or two
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
from where from the summer
 
05:04:55.440 --> 05:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
from where from the summer
um

05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that put her into fall maybe winter
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
and then somebody and a bunch of other
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
people said just
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
hop on and ride nobody's going to bother
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.160 --> 05:05:10.948 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so so that's not something i would
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
advise people do
 
05:05:14.480 --> 05:05:15.670 align:start position:0%
advise people do
currently

05:05:15.670 --> 05:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
um that's why i'm putting forward this
 
05:05:19.830 --> 05:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
build i think it's a
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
sensible way to solve the issue to give
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
our people more chances to practice to
 
05:05:26.310 --> 05:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
be safe
 
05:05:28.150 --> 05:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
to work around their busy schedule you
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
know everybody's busy in life and
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
the weather um impact
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
which we do not control
 
05:05:36.080 --> 05:05:36.868 align:start position:0%
which we do not control
so

05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:36.878 --> 05:05:37.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:05:37.750 --> 05:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's all i got thank you for
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
listening all right thank you any
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
05:05:45.670 --> 05:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's a question for the chair
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
would you be so kind as to explain what
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
the current situation is when you get
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
through the motorcycle testing program
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
um the time frame you have to get your
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
test done or how good is it long for or
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean how long is it good
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
for well right now the permit the
 
05:06:02.310 --> 05:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
learner's permit is only good for 45
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
days and you and it was put in the
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
statute that way that you only get a
 
05:06:06.550 --> 05:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
single one
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
to prevent people from getting a permit
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then a permit in the permit and
 
05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
actually never getting taking the test
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
and getting an actual license
 
05:06:13.840 --> 05:06:14.788 align:start position:0%
and getting an actual license
so

05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's what happened to this person i'm
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
assuming is that it expired because of
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
the month of july it basically rained
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
every day
 
05:06:21.360 --> 05:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
every day
um

05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:24.550 --> 05:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
so what this bill just seeks to do is
 
05:06:26.550 --> 05:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
just give you a one-time
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
extension to apply one more time so so
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
then you now you're looking at a total
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
of 90 days
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
that i hope i answered your question
 
05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
i think so i just wanted to understand
 
05:06:38.550 --> 05:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
what the process was no it's just it's a
 
05:06:38.560 --> 05:06:40.230 align:start position:0%
what the process was no it's just it's a
single

05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
single
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
extension one more period of time of 45
 
05:06:42.958 --> 05:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
extension one more period of time of 45
days

05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
just in case anybody in that situation
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
runs into a situation that they can't
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
complete it in the first 45 days
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
and can i ask you one more question
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
so if you they take the motorcycle
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
course they get their permit they go for
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
their license and they fail do they have
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
to wait a certain time period before
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
trying again that i can't answer you
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay that i'm not sure thanks maybe he
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
can okay not quite but it's a matter of
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling to take the test but while
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're waiting for the test to be
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
retaken you may want to practice but if
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
the permit is exp has expired it's a one
 
05:07:16.160 --> 05:07:17.590 align:start position:0%
the permit is exp has expired it's a one
life

05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's a lifetime permit for 45 days it's
 
05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
one once in a lifetime you can get it
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'm trying to do here is
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
extend it i saw a hand go up you might
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
well if you if you can help us um if you
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
want to just fill out a grab a pink card
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
you can give it to me later come on up
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
and introduce yourself
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm uh i'm larry crow i'm with the
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles i also run
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle rider training program
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
um and and to clarify over here there's
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's two ways to get your motorcycle
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
license in the state one is to go
 
05:07:49.270 --> 05:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
through the program be successful no
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
permit required the other way which this
 
05:07:54.310 --> 05:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
is addressing is to get a permit
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then have 45 days to practice and
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
you need to schedule that skill test
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
within those 45 days
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
so once you the 45 day ticking clock
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
includes both um
 
05:08:10.550 --> 05:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh practicing time on your own as well
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
as the time you need to be able to be
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
able to legally get to a dmv to take the
 
05:08:15.120 --> 05:08:17.190 align:start position:0%
able to legally get to a dmv to take the
test

05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
05:08:21.990 --> 05:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
or did i did i declarify
 
05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
no can i just clarify one thing
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely so you can actually get a
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
motorcycle license in the state without
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
going through the state program
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes if you teach yourself or if you are
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
18 or older the motorcycle training
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
program is optional
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay and so this whole permit thing
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't even come into play if you do
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
the motorcycle training program that is
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:08:50.320 --> 05:08:51.270 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:08:51.280 --> 05:08:52.230 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:08:52.230 --> 05:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
i have a question on the fiscal note um
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me if someone goes
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
additional 45 days to to take the exam
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
they would pay a renewal of that permit
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollars
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
and yet it shows
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
no income
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
no revenue from this only a twenty eight
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar expenditure
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so i'm trying to figure out where
 
05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
does the
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
for those people that would take this
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
where does that 25
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
show up in the fiscal note
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
as additional revenue
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
well it says it's indeterminate so the
 
05:09:39.510 --> 05:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state isn't determined
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's thirty dollars it's 25 plus five
 
05:09:41.760 --> 05:09:42.948 align:start position:0%
it's thirty dollars it's 25 plus five
more

05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:09:42.958 --> 05:09:44.390 align:start position:0%
more
um

05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
there's a hit for reprogramming the
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
machines to be able to track it
 
05:09:49.760 --> 05:09:50.470 align:start position:0%
machines to be able to track it
but

05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes for every renewal thirty dollars
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
should be collected
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me that um
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
having to reprogram
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
to allow the one-time renewal of the
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
learner's permit um they've got an
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's a number assigned to that of 28
 
05:10:11.760 --> 05:10:12.708 align:start position:0%
there's a number assigned to that of 28
000

05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
000
 
05:10:12.718 --> 05:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
000
but

05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
um but there would be some offset to
 
05:10:16.000 --> 05:10:16.868 align:start position:0%
um but there would be some offset to
that

05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
from depending on how many people
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
utilize the the one-time renewal
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
at twenty-five dollars a pop
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
does that seem fair to say uh yes thank
 
05:10:29.590 --> 05:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah yes that's exactly right they
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
just cannot say i guess
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
how many people will be renewing right
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
but they know how much it would cost to
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
correct to program i thank you
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:10:43.800 --> 05:10:43.810 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:43.810 --> 05:10:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:10:46.230 --> 05:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:10:46.240 --> 05:11:00.788 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yes

05:11:00.788 --> 05:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
is there a fee for the motorcycle
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
training program
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
in which you don't need to apply for the
 
05:11:07.360 --> 05:11:08.708 align:start position:0%
in which you don't need to apply for the
permit

05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
permit
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh correct yes it's
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
currently 155 dollars
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
but you must pass the test par which is
 
05:11:17.430 --> 05:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
part of the program at the end of the
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
program and if you fail like this lady
 
05:11:19.600 --> 05:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
program and if you fail like this lady
did

05:11:20.550 --> 05:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
she needs to get the permit and she got
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
the permit which expired
 
05:11:24.160 --> 05:11:26.150 align:start position:0%
the permit which expired
um

05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no problem thank you
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
so she was involved in the motorcycle
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
training program
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct she went through that
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
she failed and by the time she was ready
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
to retake the test she couldn't practice
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
because her permit on top of it expired
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
and the permit
 
05:11:44.718 --> 05:11:45.430 align:start position:0%
and the permit
she

05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
she
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
automatically received with the training
 
05:11:48.000 --> 05:11:49.350 align:start position:0%
automatically received with the training
program

05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
i i believe she purchased it separately
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay just to be
 
05:11:53.040 --> 05:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
okay just to be
yeah

05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
like she was trying to cover all bases
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a while to get used
 
05:12:05.830 --> 05:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
to these things any other questions from
 
05:12:08.070 --> 05:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
director do you have any idea how often
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
it is a um we get phone calls from folks
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
at motorcycle rider training whenever
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
anything on two wheels comes up and we
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
regularly do get questions from folks
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
that either have
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
recently received a permit
 
05:12:35.680 --> 05:12:36.948 align:start position:0%
recently received a permit
and

05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
are interested in renewing and then
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
learn that they can't although at this
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
point most people do understand that we
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
also get requests from people that have
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
gotten a permit in the past in a
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
returning maybe they want to get
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
they let their motorcycle license lapse
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
and want to bring it back
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter how long ago they
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
took the per they did receive a permit
 
05:13:02.550 --> 05:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a one in a lifetime so they
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
are also blocked from getting a permit
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
they got one in 2005. um they cannot get
 
05:13:11.430 --> 05:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
one in 2022. they can just go take the
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
test again i'm sorry
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
they can all you can always take the
 
05:13:18.240 --> 05:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
they can all you can always take the
test

05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
you just can't get a permit
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
you could the way that the law is
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
written it's it's one you can only get
 
05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
one in your lifetime so if they got one
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
back in 2005 maybe they got their
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
license maybe they didn't but for some
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
reason in you know i'm just making a
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
date up here 2005 they got it um it's in
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
our system and now they are not eligible
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
to get another one
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:13:47.830 --> 05:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:13:47.840 --> 05:13:48.708 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
what advice do you offer these people
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
that call and and
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
are looking for
 
05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
for input on what they can do especially
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
that person that
 
05:13:59.910 --> 05:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
maybe let their license lapse and want
 
05:14:01.590 --> 05:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
to start again
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple options they're
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
not completely blocked from ever getting
 
05:14:07.590 --> 05:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
a motorcycle license again
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i um and as the woman indicated
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
some options are
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
you do not have to have a permit in
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
order to take the test at the dmv
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind there's two ways to do
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
it motorcycle training take the test
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
you just have to be able to get your
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycle to the dmv legally and
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
especially if you're not successful get
 
05:14:31.590 --> 05:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
it out of there legally we can't
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
fail you in the test and see you right
 
05:14:33.200 --> 05:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
fail you in the test and see you right
away

05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:14:36.788 --> 05:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very bad day
 
05:14:38.948 --> 05:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
for you as we like to say
 
05:14:38.958 --> 05:14:39.990 align:start position:0%
for you as we like to say
um

05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:42.628 --> 05:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
so they may trailer it there another
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
very common thing is to have a friend
 
05:14:45.990 --> 05:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
with a motorcycle license bring the
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
motorcycle down and of course the way
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
that i like
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
you can always take the motorcycle rider
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
training program no permit required and
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
if you're if you are fully successful at
 
05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
that you get your motorcycle license
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
that way
 
05:15:03.910 --> 05:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative crawford
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you can take the
 
05:15:10.550 --> 05:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
you can oh sorry
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh so you can take the uh
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh motorcycle trading as many times as
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
you want but you can't but you only can
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
take the you can only get a one permit
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct the only thing that has
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
a limit is the permit
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh you can take the motorcycle training
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
as often as you want and you can also
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
take the test directly from the dmv
 
05:15:34.718 --> 05:15:35.830 align:start position:0%
take the test directly from the dmv
twice

05:15:35.830 --> 05:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
twice
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
if you have uh if you're unsuccessful
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
two times in a row
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
you are required to take the training
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
program that's also in the law thank you
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so we all know that practice
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
makes perfect and practice is what's
 
05:15:57.270 --> 05:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to make us safe riders and drivers
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
so if
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
someone can't practice
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
how are they going to
 
05:16:03.920 --> 05:16:05.030 align:start position:0%
how are they going to
improve

05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
improve
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
take their license exam
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
other than
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
take the rota motorcycle training course
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's no other option to legally
 
05:16:15.280 --> 05:16:16.788 align:start position:0%
there's no other option to legally
practice

05:16:16.788 --> 05:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
without the permit i think that's what
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
i'm getting
 
05:16:22.948 --> 05:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
i believe you're correct thank you thank
 
05:16:22.958 --> 05:16:24.628 align:start position:0%
i believe you're correct thank you thank
you

05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions okay
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i didn't say
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
you've already been around once
 
05:16:32.550 --> 05:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question what
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
was the original rationale for the one
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
i i do not have an answer i'm sorry i
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
before my time as i mentioned to prevent
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
people from just getting permit after
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
permit at the permit and never actually
 
05:16:48.628 --> 05:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
getting a license
 
05:16:50.948 --> 05:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
director how long does it take to take
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
the safety course
 
05:16:54.958 --> 05:16:55.750 align:start position:0%
the safety course
and

05:16:55.750 --> 05:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:55.760 --> 05:16:56.788 align:start position:0%
and
what

05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you allow them a permit
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
while they're taking it if it's a
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
it is a multi-day course it is done on a
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
closed course under our supervision on
 
05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
our motorcycles so a permit is not
 
05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:18.400 --> 05:17:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
but i guess my question is are they
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
given a permit while they're taking that
 
05:17:25.040 --> 05:17:26.150 align:start position:0%
given a permit while they're taking that
course

05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
in order to go and
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
no right no because we're going to
 
05:17:33.030 --> 05:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
during the course they will receive that
 
05:17:33.040 --> 05:17:34.868 align:start position:0%
during the course they will receive that
test

05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
we provide all the practice for them
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
during the course
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:49.270 --> 05:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
i don't often ask general questions like
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
this but
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
is there any downside to issuing a
 
05:17:55.030 --> 05:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
one-time extension to the motorcycle
 
05:17:59.190 --> 05:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
either one is there a downside to this i
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen one i just figured i'd ask
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
i do not see one either thank you okay
 
05:18:06.868 --> 05:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
i concur thank you very much for any
 
05:18:11.670 --> 05:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:18:13.190 --> 05:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay seeing that i'm going to close the
 
05:18:33.620 --> 05:18:33.630 align:start position:0%

05:18:35.910 --> 05:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
do you think it's highly controversial
 
05:18:40.070 --> 05:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
oh i'm not ready to execute this one oh
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
you don't okay that's why we just

05:31:08.070 --> 05:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
feasibility and implementation of
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
furthering electric vehicle adoption in
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:31:13.350 --> 05:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative fenton
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman ladies and
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
gentlemen the committee i am
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative donovan fenton for the
 
05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
record and i represent keane
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm here to talk to you about
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
feasibility and implementation of
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
furthering electrical vehicle adoption
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and that's a mouthful
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i apologize for the verbiage on that
 
05:31:35.350 --> 05:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
so as you know most car manufacturers
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
are pledging to have most of their fleet
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
be electric or decided to be fully
 
05:31:39.120 --> 05:31:40.150 align:start position:0%
be electric or decided to be fully
electric

05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
electric
 
05:31:41.590 --> 05:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
most have declared this to happen by
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
2030 which is not far away
 
05:31:45.750 --> 05:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
general motors has said that they will
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
be fully electric by the year 2035. uh
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
this includes their new hummer
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
chevrolet has also said that their new
 
05:31:53.750 --> 05:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
silverado ev will be out in the next
 
05:31:53.760 --> 05:31:54.788 align:start position:0%
silverado ev will be out in the next
year

05:31:54.788 --> 05:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
ford plans to increase its production
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
capacity of electric vehicles to up to
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
600 000 units by 2023.
 
05:32:03.910 --> 05:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
this includes their new lightning f-150
 
05:32:03.920 --> 05:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
this includes their new lightning f-150
ev

05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
ev
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
so the reasoning behind this bill is
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
that new car dealers in new hampshire
 
05:32:10.708 --> 05:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
won't be getting as many of these evs as
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
compared to the other states around us
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers send these cars to other
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
states because they get incentives to do
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
so this can lead our this can lead ours
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
this can let our constituents leave new
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire to purchase these cars
 
05:32:22.878 --> 05:32:24.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire to purchase these cars
elsewhere

05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
my hope for this bill is to study and
 
05:32:27.270 --> 05:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
find creative ways where we can sell
 
05:32:29.110 --> 05:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
these cars in new hampshire this bill
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
will hopefully help support and develop
 
05:32:32.470 --> 05:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
a way to sell zero mission vehicles here
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire without adhering to any
 
05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
mandates if you have any questions feel
 
05:32:38.548 --> 05:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
please feel free to ask them dan bennett
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
was supposed to back me up but he's
 
05:32:42.310 --> 05:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
caught up in the senate so it's just me

we just had a meeting this past friday
and

05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
what you'd like to establish here in my
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
opinion is the same thing as what we're
 
05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
doing already
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
my opinion i think is i think we have a
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
of committees already
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i think senator waters should
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
who is
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
who has testified in front of our
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee the the council i should say
 
05:34:15.600 --> 05:34:16.548 align:start position:0%
committee the the council i should say
uh

05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
i was really hoping there was a question
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
there somewhere right now be aware
 
05:34:23.030 --> 05:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
are you aware of this oh i wish you had
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
grabbed me before this and i would have
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
run out of the room but um no i wasn't
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
aware so
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
like i said earlier this and thank you
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
for the question uh but um no so the
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
more um this feels more geared towards
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
get around these mandates with getting
 
05:34:41.670 --> 05:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
these cars into new hampshire so when a
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
when a constituent or a new hampshire
 
05:34:44.788 --> 05:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
resident goes to purchase one of these
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles in new hampshire they
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
are a disadvantage because that new
 
05:34:51.190 --> 05:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire car dealer might only get one
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
of that ev whereas the massachusetts
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
dealer gets 15 to 20 of those evs
 
05:34:57.270 --> 05:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
because of certain mandates so that's
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
what the intent of this bill was you
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
know if you think it overlaps with that
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know i wish i had known about that
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
earlier um and senator waters um but
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the intent of this bill
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
05:35:08.400 --> 05:35:10.708 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
committee

05:35:10.708 --> 05:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:35:13.270 --> 05:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
well seeing none i have just one yeah
 
05:35:15.430 --> 05:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
just i've asked the question before the
 
05:35:17.430 --> 05:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
last time we talked about electric
 
05:35:17.440 --> 05:35:18.548 align:start position:0%
last time we talked about electric
vehicles

05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
tesla spent a lot of their own money
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
creating the infrastructure even in the
 
05:35:24.628 --> 05:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
has four gm or any of the other
 
05:35:26.878 --> 05:35:28.708 align:start position:0%
has four gm or any of the other
manufacturers

05:35:28.708 --> 05:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
offered to participate in the
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for these electric
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles or they are waiting for this to
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
become part of
 
05:35:37.030 --> 05:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
the public responsibility so they can
 
05:35:37.040 --> 05:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
the public responsibility so they can
benefit

05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question mr chair
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh that'd be a question better for dan
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
um but i would hope so um i know the
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is severely lacking for
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
these vehicles um
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
you know in keene especially there's no
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
charging stations for these cars
 
05:35:56.310 --> 05:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative telersky
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure if i i was busy
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
digging for my copy of the bill i
 
05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it because i may have
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
missed the beginning of what you were
 
05:36:04.240 --> 05:36:05.110 align:start position:0%
missed the beginning of what you were
saying

05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:36:05.120 --> 05:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
saying
but

05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
do i understand that what you're saying
 
05:36:07.600 --> 05:36:08.548 align:start position:0%
do i understand that what you're saying
is

05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:36:10.948 --> 05:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
is lacking
 
05:36:14.230 --> 05:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
certain incentives for the cars to get
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
here in the first place so even if there
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
are buyers
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
willing to buy and dealers willing to
 
05:36:20.240 --> 05:36:21.350 align:start position:0%
willing to buy and dealers willing to
sell

05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
sell
 
05:36:22.948 --> 05:36:22.958 align:start position:0%
there's certain things that are making
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers send cars to other states
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
is that what we're trying to figure out
 
05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question that
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
that that is accurate um the states
 
05:36:32.230 --> 05:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
around us
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
adhere to certain mandates where they
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
get the manufacturers get incentives to
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
push their cars to those states i'm not
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
saying new hampshire doesn't get any of
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
these cars but they get a
 
05:36:42.628 --> 05:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
significant less amount uh than the
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
other states around us so a lot of
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
customers are leaving new hampshire to
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
go to these other states to purchase
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
these vehicles
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%

05:46:15.430 --> 05:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
and time is permitting so we're going to
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%

05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open the executive session
 
05:46:23.590 --> 05:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1658 fn relative to the
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
testing in lieu of license renewal fees
 
05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative hill
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to move interim study on
 
05:46:36.788 --> 05:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
1658 fn second seconded by
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative gagley
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to motion
 
05:46:42.310 --> 05:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
briefly um
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
i think there's enough here that uh that
 
05:46:44.878 --> 05:46:46.708 align:start position:0%
i think there's enough here that uh that
could

05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:46:50.470 --> 05:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
truly be an interim study um i think
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
the idea i think we all said that uh the
 
05:46:53.200 --> 05:46:54.390 align:start position:0%
the idea i think we all said that uh the
idea

05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
is laudable to uh increase our product
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge here of of the road and the
 
05:47:00.080 --> 05:47:01.830 align:start position:0%
knowledge here of of the road and the
rules

05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i think there may be some
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh questions that need to be buttoned
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
down for instance um what happens if
 
05:47:08.878 --> 05:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
down for instance um what happens if
someone

05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
someone
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh fails that the test and then is able
 
05:47:16.470 --> 05:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
to pay the fee and and get the license
 
05:47:19.270 --> 05:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct or not so i think it's
 
05:47:19.280 --> 05:47:20.548 align:start position:0%
is that correct or not so i think it's
worth

05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
worth
 
05:47:23.590 --> 05:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:25.270 --> 05:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
brain cells wasted
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
by looking at
 
05:47:29.910 --> 05:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
interim study and see if we can uh see
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
if we can
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
add some more details to this maybe for
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
a bill next year
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:41.830 --> 05:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm getting a little bit confused 1658
 
05:47:44.628 --> 05:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
was the bill that you called
 
05:47:44.638 --> 05:47:45.430 align:start position:0%
was the bill that you called
oh

05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:47:47.430 --> 05:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i what i was hearing his testimony

06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually at the time director bolecki
 
06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
this just deals with the medical waivers
 
06:02:37.110 --> 06:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
that we never touched this is currently
 
06:02:38.628 --> 06:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
we changed the light transmittance
 
06:02:43.350 --> 06:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
allowance to the aftermarket tinting to
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
70 percent based on the way it's
 
06:02:46.788 --> 06:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
measured nowadays
 
06:02:49.030 --> 06:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
and then we looked at the waiver and it
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
currently allows for 35 light
 
06:02:54.230 --> 06:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
transmittance with the waiver on the
 
06:02:54.240 --> 06:02:55.670 align:start position:0%
transmittance with the waiver on the
windshield

06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
windshield
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's just about limo black on the
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
windshield all this build does is match
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
it with what we passed last year at 70
 
06:03:02.718 --> 06:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
it with what we passed last year at 70
percent

06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
still would require the waiver from the
 
06:03:08.230 --> 06:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
department for the windshield but at
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
least it's at a the same level is that
 
06:03:13.030 --> 06:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
we already have allowed on the sides and
 
06:03:14.788 --> 06:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
not overly dark
 
06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that's all it does it's a
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill it was just something
 
06:03:18.628 --> 06:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
that was discovered
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
06:03:27.270 --> 06:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:27.280 --> 06:03:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
nope

06:03:30.230 --> 06:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:32.548 --> 06:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
sorry just for the record did this come
 
06:03:32.558 --> 06:03:34.150 align:start position:0%
sorry just for the record did this come
from

06:03:34.150 --> 06:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
the department yeah thank you yeah she
 
06:03:38.470 --> 06:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
approached me
 
06:03:39.510 --> 06:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
i was just at the committee of
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
conference last year because they were
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
going through rules or getting ready to
 
06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
go through rules and that's when she
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
discovered the issue by that time it was
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
too late for us to do anything so i said
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
we'll tackle it in the fall or next year
 
06:03:53.430 --> 06:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
which is where we are
 
06:03:55.270 --> 06:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none you're letting me off the
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
did you did you want to
 
06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
chairman walsh you promised no more
 
06:04:06.030 --> 06:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
window tint bills for the
 
06:04:06.040 --> 06:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
window tint bills for the
[Laughter]

06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%

06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right any discussion sure thank you
 
06:07:29.910 --> 06:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair as i said a few
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
minutes ago this is a housekeeping bill
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
this was something that was missed last
 
06:07:36.150 --> 06:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
year when we made the changes to the
 
06:07:39.190 --> 06:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
tinting levels of 70 on the windows left
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
and right of the operator
 
06:07:43.190 --> 06:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill was not touched
 
06:07:45.430 --> 06:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
and it was recognized after the fact
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that it still allowed for a 35 percent
 
06:07:49.430 --> 06:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
light transmittance on the windshield
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
which everybody um
 
06:07:54.230 --> 06:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
found concerning this changes it to 70
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
to match what we currently allow by
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
statute on the left and right side
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
windows by waiver only
 
06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
again housekeeping
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:08.310 --> 06:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead represent hill um question
 
06:08:10.948 --> 06:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
i should have asked the sponsor earlier
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:08:14.470 --> 06:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
does this have anything to do with or
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
does it affect
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:08:19.270 --> 06:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
the line of tinting that's on the
 
06:08:21.670 --> 06:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
windshield that um
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know right along the surface that
 
06:08:25.510 --> 06:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
has been there for
 
06:08:25.520 --> 06:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
has been there for
years

06:08:26.470 --> 06:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:08:28.948 --> 06:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh on some cars
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
no thank you for the question and
 
06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
actually i think a lot of people that
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
looked at this when we were making the
 
06:08:36.070 --> 06:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
changes last year assumed that when it
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
was talking of windshield that's all it
 
06:08:39.270 --> 06:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
was referring to
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
but after having a discussion with the
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
director of motor vehicles that was an
 
06:08:45.670 --> 06:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
assumption that was wrong
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
this currently
 
06:08:48.788 --> 06:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
as it's written
 
06:08:50.708 --> 06:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
currently would allow 35 light
 
06:08:53.110 --> 06:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
transmittance on the entire windshield
 
06:08:54.470 --> 06:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we want to change it
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
to at least 70. thank you for that
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
clarification but what um
 
06:09:00.788 --> 06:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
did the director mention at all what
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
happens to that
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
that i don't even know what to call it
 
06:09:09.030 --> 06:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
that shade strip that that does come
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
on some vehicles that's right at the
 
06:09:15.270 --> 06:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
um the roof line
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's been there for years on a number
 
06:09:18.788 --> 06:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
of cars
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
years and years and years
 
06:09:23.430 --> 06:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to set up a stage
 
06:09:25.590 --> 06:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
where that is
 
06:09:28.628 --> 06:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
going to be i don't know illegal or
 
06:09:31.430 --> 06:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
well if i can message you absolutely
 
06:09:32.708 --> 06:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
i don't believe those are currently
 
06:09:34.390 --> 06:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
illegal but i guess if you do apply it
 
06:09:35.590 --> 06:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
to the whole windshield it would be
 
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
slightly darker at the top
 
06:09:39.350 --> 06:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
i still don't see it illegal and i don't
 
06:09:40.948 --> 06:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
see it in the statute
 
06:09:42.948 --> 06:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
i don't even know if those
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
strips are still even being done on
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that was something i used
 
06:09:49.830 --> 06:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
to see in the 70s and 80s but
 
06:09:51.350 --> 06:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
i get well i don't own anything that new
 
06:09:53.190 --> 06:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if they still do it but
 
06:09:54.628 --> 06:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
but i haven't seen anything in the
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
statute that would make an issue there
 
06:09:56.638 --> 06:09:59.350 align:start position:0%
statute that would make an issue there
okay

06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:01.350 --> 06:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative sykes i might offer some
 
06:10:03.670 --> 06:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
clarification too this is after-market
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
tint correct as well it has nothing to
 
06:10:08.230 --> 06:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
do with something that came with the car
 
06:10:10.230 --> 06:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
in its original manufacture correct
 
06:10:10.240 --> 06:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
in its original manufacture correct
correct

06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:16.390 --> 06:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
