United States
America

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
stands so I want to um welcome everyone
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
to uh uh the new uh session year and to
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee um I guess what
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do first um and I and I know
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
this will be because for the returning
 
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
members this will be kind of old hat
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
you've heard it you've heard it all
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
before but I think it would be helpful
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
for the new members and maybe you know
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
as a as a uh just a little refresher for
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
all of us um since uh some of us are
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit advanced in years
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
and you know we might have a senior
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
moment from time to time
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
so uh so what I what I'm uh gonna ask us
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
to do first is uh for everyone to tell
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
us who you are and sort of why you're
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
here that is why you decided on the
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and um I'll start
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
and then I'll ask the vice chair and the
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
ranking member to go next and from that
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
after that we'll kind of go around the
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
room um so my name is Bob Lynn I'm a
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
representative from Windam this is my
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
third term um I'm I'm a republican uh in
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
terms of why I'm I'm here um I have some
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
interest in things uh dealing with the
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in particular since I spent a
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
fair amount of time as a judge um in New
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in terms of my my interests
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
um this uh this year um a lot of the
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
things that I'm interested in and bills
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
that I have drafted I've proposed bills
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
on are actually not before the Judiciary
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
Committee I have a couple of things that
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
I think are pretty important before um
 
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
election law I have uh one or two that I
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
think are going to go to um education
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then I do have some here um
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
including uh one dealing with um end of
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
life options that I know representative
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
Smith is a co-sponsor on um and there
 
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
are some other ones uh that I have here
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
some dealing with the right to no law
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
there uh that are designed to uh um
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
correct areas that I think need to be
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
corrected in the right to no law as some
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
of you may know particularly the people
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
are here we uh or last time we had a
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
number of right to know bills last time
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
I think we made some uh pretty good
 
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
progress but there's some stuff yet to
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
be done um so that's that's it for me
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative man thank
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Dennis Manion from
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
Salem uh this is my second term and I
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
was asked uh earlier this year if I
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
would come over here and be Vice chair I
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
came over from Criminal Justice and
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
Public Safety uh I did 30 years in law
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement eight of those years as a
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
police prosecutor not a lawyer just a
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
twoe course and you go prosecute crimes
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
um some of my interests here mostly
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
criminal justice related so I filed a
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
few bills that I'm going to go through
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
that committee on assaulting police
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
officers and false reports and um
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
another one on being able to get
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
Firearms back quicker uh if they're
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
taken for uh by the court for any reason
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
restraining order or communal B
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
protective order I guess it's quite a
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
long time before you you're able to have
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
a firearm back but you're not able to
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
the court doesn't move quick enough so
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the bills that I
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
have filed um I guess that's about it
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
for me and I I I hope my experience
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
helps in this committee there are some
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
areas I'm not experiencing but there are
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
some that I am that's it thank you
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you very much
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
and welcome to the Judiciary Committee
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
my name is mar Smith this is my 14th
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
term I'm looking around and I'd like to
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
say that I began before many of you were
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
born and I think it's only one of you
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
who wasn't born in
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
1996 no no I was too oh all right well
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that's why I can accept your
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
judgments so representative Alexander um
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
my time in the legislature has been Divi
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
divided between uh finance and
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and you will see that you can
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
take the girl off Finance but you can't
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
take Finance out of the girl because I
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
frequently pay attention to those
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
issues um in terms of bills that I filed
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
personally I don't think that's really
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
necessary to talk about here what I want
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
to talk about is that this is a very
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
very important committee it um it deals
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
with significant life and death issues
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
and it also deals with what I think of
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
as core principles of what at least used
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
to be the state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
philosophy and that is the importance of
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
personal privacy and the importance of
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
accountability um as we see it through
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
right to know so those are issues that I
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
care about completely um I
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
am uh
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I'm a Democrat I've been a
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
Democrat but in terms of my function in
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
the committee it is
 
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan and I look to learn a lot
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
from all of my colleagues Democrat and
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
Republican so that together we can get
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
as close as we can to move
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
ourselves forward and um and I'm really
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
glad to work with my old friends and
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
people who will now be my new friends

the ju Judiciary Committee um because
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know I believe that we are a country
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
of Law and Order and at the same time
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're a country of freedom and there has
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
to be a great balance between those two
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
things um and I do have as well a number
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
of family and friends that have either
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
currently or were at one time in law
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement I'm actually one of the
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
people that helped start the Comfort dog
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
program for um the police departments in
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
the state and um that's that's that's
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
about it learn terrific thank you
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative Horan um so my name is
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan like represent Smith I'm
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
from straford County District 10 which
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
is the town of Durham and um I've been
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
on this committee this is my seventh
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
term and then there's an eighth termiz
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
on a committee that doesn't exist
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
anymore which kind of overlapped the
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
work of this committee so um I guess I I
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
guess I came back because I want to
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
preserve you know the rule of law and
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
our personal personal freedoms so I may
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
um and I have hav I don't think any of
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
the bills I've introduced sponsored or
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor will end up in this committee
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
but I
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
did uh sponsor a perennial bill which is
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
now over from the new housing committee
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
one of the many perennial landlord
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
tenant bills that come back year after
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
year so I'll be seeing actually repr
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
Alexander over there over there because
 
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
he's has a dual role he's on that
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
committee too so we um and um so even
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
though we don't have those landlord
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
tenant bills to do anymore I'm sure our
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
work will expand fill the uh time
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
available to do it so that hopefully
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'll mostly look forward to doing it so
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
said they would get here as soon as they
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%

serving on various Municipal boards but
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
perspective on uh you know what uh
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
what's good and bad in our our towns and
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%

00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
I I think we will this term also um
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
issues that are important to me are

domestic violence is extremely important
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%

special election in 2021 um I previously
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
served red on Transportation uh for the
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
last few years I had been a town
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
counselor in Bedford um and so thought
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
at that time my uh experience with roads
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
and local speed limits and those sorts
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
of questions uh might be helpful in that
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
committee um but I am an attorney and
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
felt this would be a good opportunity
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
This this term to to bring some of my
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%

that work and I I know it was successful
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%

i' what I'd ask you to do is I I put
down

00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
I prepared a list of all the members
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
with the phone numbers and email
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
addresses that I got off the judicial
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
branch website what I'd ask you to do
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
please is look at it and make sure it's
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
correct and more importantly if there's
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
another phone number or another email
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
address and you'll see that for some of
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
you there is no phone number listed
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
because I didn't have it on the we from
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the website but if there's another phone
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
number or another email address that is
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
more convenient for you please please
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
put that
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
in um Mr chair I didn't see I passed it
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
down with um my colleagues help but I do
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
want to note that I believe it is the
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
21st or the 22nd that all of our
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
legislative email addresses are going to
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
change so I would not
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
um put this in stone until after that
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's good that's a good point and and
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
just to add to that I actually think if
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
somebody emails the old email address it
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
will go it will go to the new inbox so
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's not like the end of the world if
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
somebody emails your legislative email
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
address right yeah yeah you know what
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
the the just so you know the the thing
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
I'm most important most interested in I
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
mean email addresses are important but
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm most interested in is for
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
some of you there was no phone number
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
listed and so I'd like that and and
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
secondly is you know if the on the
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
website it lists your home phone number
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
but your cell phone is the one that's
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
easiest to get in touch with you please
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
put that down so I can get in touch with
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%

the education committee last year and
 
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.350 align:start position:0%
the education committee last year and
that

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
was basically sensory overload so I am
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
very happy to be on Judiciary even
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
though we deal with a lot of heavy
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
topics um but uh yeah I'm I'm very
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
interested in being on this committee
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
this while the sheet is going around um
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
numbers and email addresses um everyone
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
should have gotten and I see everyone is
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
in the proper place the seating chart
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll notice that um I basically
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
triy to as we did last year to break it
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
up you know Republican Democrat
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
Republican Democrat except for the kind
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
of leadership up here um uh and the idea
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
is to you know to Foster communication
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
between between people who may not
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree on things uh hopefully
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
that that will work out um in terms of
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
and I know some a number of you have
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
raised issues with me so I guess what I
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
want to say is um this um we right now
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
the last I checked early this morning we
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
had 34 bills that were assigned to this
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sure that's not the end of
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
it we're going to I suspect we're going
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
to get uh uh you know last year I think
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
we had 43 or 44 so I you know I suspect
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to get something at least
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
around there um for uh for this year um
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
our you should know everyone should know
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
that we share this room with two other
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
committees on Tuesday's Child and Family
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh the child and family committee uses
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
this room and on Friday the state
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
federal relations and Veterans Affairs
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
uses this room
 
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
um if past experience is you know proves
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
to be the same this time um child and
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
family will be busy very busy as are we
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
state federal relations may be less busy
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
so it may be that
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
after uh you
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
know late February something like that
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
um uh Fridays will that this room will
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
be available on Fridays because at least
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
at least a number of times will be
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
available on Fridays because state
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal will will have finished um their
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
work but at any rate so what I wanted to
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
EMP empz is our typical day for meeting
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays um uh but we may also have
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
some times particularly as we get closer
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
to a crossover or if we have early bills
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh that we need to deal with we may also
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
have to meet on Monday so there may be
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we will be meeting both
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
on Monday and on uh Wednesday the thing
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
I should emphasize for the particularly
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
for the new people is this
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
when we have hearings scheduled there is
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
no requirement of a quorum for hearings
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
so if you can't you know obviously I
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
encourage all of you to come I'm not
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting you shouldn't come it's it's
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
important that I think that you do come
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
but if for some reason you can't come
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be absolutely the end
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
of the world we don't have to get a
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
substitute for you um or anything like
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
that when we have executive sessions
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
however then we do need a quorum and it
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
really is important important that
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
everyone be here and if you're not able
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
to be here on a day when we're going to
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
have an executive session um then it's
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
important that if you're a republican
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
you let me know or if you're a Democrat
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
you let representative Smith know so
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
that we can get a substitute for you
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
because um particularly if a bill you
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
know if there are controversial bills
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
that are likely to to generate a
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
Partyline vote um it's important that
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
both parties have all their members here
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
and so we want to make sure that that um
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
happens Mr chair yes um in light of the
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
rule change that we agreed to last
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um concerning um a notice each
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
day each hearing day about the
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of executive sessions do you
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
have a particular policy that you're
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
planning to try to follow I do yes so as
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know that the um the policy had that
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
we've adopted last week has gone back to
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
to the what has been referred to as the
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
traditional policy which is that we if
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
we put if we publish a notice with the
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
with uh the notice of hearings that says
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
we can exec on any bill that has had a
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
hearing at any time during the course of
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
the day that that that you know that
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
we're holding hearings um then we can
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
then we can do that without some further
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
notice um what what I my what I plan to
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
do is this
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
I I I plan to take advantage of that if
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
it appears that we have that one of two
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
conditions is satisfied either everybody
 
00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:13.350 align:start position:0%
conditions is satisfied either everybody
is

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
here um or it appears that even if
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
everybody isn't here we J there's an
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelming consensus that of what we
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
should do and I can tell I may in fact I
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
may even ask for you know a straw vote
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
but I will I will tell you now so
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
because I'm not I'm not going to play
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
games I am not going to call for an
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
executive session on something that's
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
controversial where somebody's missing
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just not that I'm not going to play
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
that game um so if everybody's here then
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
I may call an executive session on
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
something even I suppose even if it is
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
controversial but U more likely what I'm
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
where we we're going to have an
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
executive session is on things that um
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
are you know are non-controversial and
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
in that case even if somebody's missing
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
if it you know if if uh 1777 out of 19
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
people are or I'm sorry 17 out of 18
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
people seem to think it's okay and one
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
person's missing or you know 16 out of
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
18 and one person's missing I we
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
probably will go ahead and and um exec
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
the bill and I use as an example I'm I'm
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
sure that you the new folks don't don't
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
um will not understand this but there's
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
a bill that we're going to be hand
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
hearing this afternoon representative
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
tur's bill on uh assistant managers in
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
limited liabil ility companies that we
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
had a significant discussion on last
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
year we passed it and the Senate uh the
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
Senate didn't didn't do its job I would
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
say uh or at least the other body didn't
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
do it didn't didn't uh for whatever
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
reason didn't pass it if if I had given
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
the notice in for for today this
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon's hearings which I didn't so
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
we can't do that but if I had given it
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that would be an example of a bill where
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
it might make a lot of sense to
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
executive because I suspect you know we
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh we passed it overwhelmingly last time
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we would feel the same way um
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
this time um the last thing I want to
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
raise here is um the issue of starting
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
times uh there's been some uh some
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
issues regarding
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
that I seem to remember and and I'm
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to you know to to
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
respond to this my recollection from
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
last year is that we had done it
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
at various times both ways we had
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
started sometimes at 9 we started
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes at 10 and I I recall that we
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
had a discussion about it my
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
recollection was that most people
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
thought it was better to start at 10:
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
but I raise that again now I mean we we
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
could start at 9: we could start at 9:30
 
00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
we could start at
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
10: sometimes it you know I'm going to
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to make that decision
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
whe When I have to sometimes it I think
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
it will be that we may we have we maybe
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
have so much to do that we just have to
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
start at 9: whether we you know would
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
prefer that or not but generally I would
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
like to do what most people want so can
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
I can I ask just ask how many people
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock okay how many people would
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
rather start at 10
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
o'clock well hang on
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
all right um and how about
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
9:30 I could kind of live with 9:30 0
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah no no I could I I just did so I
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
think if I can you what um so I'm just
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
want can the people who have trouble
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
with nine can you just tell me what the
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
what the issue I know representative
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
Burch lives far away and that's yeah
 
00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult to do
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
and just try to respect those who have
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
three hours of driving each
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
day is there any you know is there
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
anyone on the other side of it that has
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
you know there's a particular reason to
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
start early because you need to go
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere later on representative Perez
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I have two issues now the
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
reason why I had asked for 9:30 when I
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
sent out something was try to make a
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
compromise I have an issue with going
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
late in the day I have commitments that
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
I have to work around late in the day
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
but that's not the biggest thing the
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
biggest thing we're winter time we may
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
say that a hearing starts at 3:30 but if
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
we're way behind that may not start till
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
4:15 we may not be out of here until
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
whenever as much as we would like to be
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want to drive home after
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
dark well what I yes I'm sorry
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland thank you Mr
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I just add to that I would
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
Echo what uh representative Paris said
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
but I think um given what you were
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
saying about our heavy workload this
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
year here uh my interest would be in how
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
we can get the most work done in the
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
days that we are here uh and uh uh you
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
know while uh I understand uh Mr burch's
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
concern I you know I too have a
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
three-hour round trip um I I think that
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
if we can maximize the the use of the
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
daytime it would be to our advantage and
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
and from a personal standpoint um I have
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh a lot more meetings in the evening
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
than I do in the early mornings so those
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
are the reasons represented Alexander
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I in the spirit of compromise
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with whatever time I think what
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
you've done in the past is executive
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
sessions you've had a 10 public hearing
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
start at nine kind of thing um I think
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
that worked out decently um I bartend
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
for a living so you might see me jet out
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
early afternoons for public during
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing days um so that's also
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
my reasoning okay all right uh yes
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative trip and then
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative work uh you would mention
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
that there's a possibility that we would
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
have uh uh two committee hear committee
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
meetings a week you know it seems that
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to do that uh we could
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate you know the contention over
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
starting early or late you know because
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
we would be able to get whatever we need
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
done you know done at uh in a a 10 to
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
three uh time
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%

justice as arriv
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
discussion but um I'm G to ask the Chief

some slides that are they'll be passed
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
around for the record Gordon McDonald

krian who's the general counsel for the
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I I want to say at the
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
outset this is I know there are many
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
many returning members of this committee
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
and some with deep experience in the
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I don't mean to insult
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
anyone with these slides uh but I do
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
think it's helpful just to give a
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
baseline of information about the
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh slide three is just an overview
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
of what I'd like to cover today one give
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh the committee an overview of our
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
structure and two to discuss some of the
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
challenges and opportunities we face so
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
on slide four you see on the left hand
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
side a visual depiction of the structure
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
basic structure of the judish Branch we
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
are comprised of two trial courts
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court and Superior Court and one
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
appell Court the sup Supreme Court and
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
all three courts are supported by the
 
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
courts and I'm going to go through Court
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
by court and function by function and
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
give you a brief overview so let's start
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
with the circuit court on the next slide
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
page five the Circuit Court was created
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
in 2011 by this legislature it combined
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
the then existing District Court probate
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%

subject matter jurisdiction virtually
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
common law jurisdiction on the next
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
circuits one for each County and uh 34
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%

will see um the filings in the Circuit
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
Court by case type so these numbers are
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
from 2023 calendar year
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
2023 and you will see that uh over
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
100,000 cases flowed through the circuit
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
court that year the largest single case
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%

misdemeanors uh these numbers are
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
subject to change in 2024 because of the
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
so-called unwind of felonies first um

determinations back to where we were uh
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
prior to 2016 when felonies first uh
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
began next slide is an overview of the
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%

from
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
2023 um and the largest single component
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
of that in 2023 is our criminal
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%

legislation authorizes three and then
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
permits me to come back and ask for two
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
more based on our
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
experience uh and you can see the
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
subject matter jurisdiction of the our
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
magistrates laid out on this slide and
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
that was uh pursuant to the legislation
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
in an order of the Supreme
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
Court uh they spent a month being
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
trained and went live on January 1st and
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
among other things they are covering um
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
where appropriate where the statute uh
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
requires uh bail hearings over weekends
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
so they are switching off weekend by
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
weekend and conducting bail hearings on
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
1 uh next slide is the Supreme Court an
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%

bar on the next slide you will see uh
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
our workload Supreme Court's workload
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
these numbers are from
 
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.069 align:start position:0%
these numbers are from
2023

00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
um 61 opinions issued in
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
2023 and
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
728 fi uh final
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
dispositions that final disposition
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
number is the real measure of our
 
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
workload at the Supreme Court and I do
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
have numbers from last year calendar
 
00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.309 align:start position:0%
have numbers from last year calendar
year

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
2024 and so that final disposition
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
number has increased
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh from 728 to
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
752 which is the highest level of
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
productivity if you will since 2015 at
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court we issued 71 opinions
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
2024 um the administrative office of the
 
00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:50.589 align:start position:0%
2024 um the administrative office of the
courts

00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
about uh 50 full-time employees and many
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
many part-time employees
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh and again they provide support
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
services for all three courts including
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
our legal and legislative Council our
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
Communications function Financial it and
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
court security in our cir courts and on
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
page slide 18 you can see the list of
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
discharges so on beginning on slide 19 I
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
would just like to give the committee a
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
Ben benefit of at least our view of what
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
what some of the challenges and
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities facing the judicial branch
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
are slide 20 you can see them listed and
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
I'll go through each one of them
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
individually starting with challenges on
 
00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.150 align:start position:0%
individually starting with challenges on
slide

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
21 uh Safety and
 
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.630 align:start position:0%
21 uh Safety and
Security

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
Security
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh it is um this is one issue that
 
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.069 align:start position:0%
uh it is um this is one issue that
really

00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
really is of constant concern the Safety
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
and Security of everyone who walks
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
through our Doors members of the public
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
our court staff our
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
judges um
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
and in all of our locations around the
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
state we benefit from a tremendous
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
partnership with New Hampshire sheriffs
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
sheriffs are primarily responsible for
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
security in the Superior Courts and as I
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
said uh
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
theoc uh trains uh security officers and
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
deploys security officers in the circuit
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
court it's had some important
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
developments thanks to legislative
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
support our court security officers uh
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
are now uh can now will now be able to
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
go through a specialized training
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
program at police standards and training
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
Council directed to their unique
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
functions and that is that is a brand
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
new development and we're looking
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
forward to uh implementing that and we
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the U great collaboration
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
from police standards on that another
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
really important initiative is uh
 
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
because of the availability of arpa
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
funds we are engaging in a site by sight
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
physical assessment of security threats
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
and opportunities in each one of our
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
locations around the state and uh
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
that'll give us a catalog of of
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities to perhaps improve on how
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
our physical locations
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
um with respect to
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
security the next slide
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
um addresses the uh I think a very
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
significant challenge confronting the
 
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.549 align:start position:0%
significant challenge confronting the
Superior

00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
Superior
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
Court um more than 1300 cases have been
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
generated from the uh issues involving
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
the Youth Development Center uh and
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
those are all in Superior Court uh they
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
are very resource
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
intensive 1300 cases against a case load
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
of 24,000 is
 
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
material and these it is even more
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
material given the complexity and nature
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
of these cases they are really consume a
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
resources and uh if chief justice Howard
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
were here he would tell you that the of
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
the dedication and hard work of the
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court the judges involved and
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
the staff involved in processing these
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
cases indeed he he he has related to me
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
that there is an employee in our
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
electronic filing Center in Manchester
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
who gets to work
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
early 5:00
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
a.m. to be able to process all the
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
Motions pending motions in the YDC cases
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
around the
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
state it's a real challenge for us in
 
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:50.839 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
resources next slide addresses U another
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately perennial challenge which
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
is access to Justice in any given day in
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
our Circuit Court up to 90% of litigant
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
in in many case types have no attorney
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're self-represented on either side
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
planner for defendant this is just a
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
challenge obviously for the litigants
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
involved but also it's a challenge for
 
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:16.910 align:start position:0%
involved but also it's a challenge for
the

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
system uh one important initiative uh
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.630 align:start position:0%
that the
legislature

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
um LED with and and has um enacted
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
legislation to to enable
 
00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:33.789 align:start position:0%
legislation to to enable
paraprofessional

00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
representation in many case types in all
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
of our circuit courts and that went live
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
last year and the preliminary data
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
information that we have coming back on
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
that it's it's hopeful there are lots of
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities to expand it uh but it is
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
a way to get a legally trained person
 
00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
standing next to someone you on a really
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
important day in their lives in court
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
before a
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
judge um one issue that uh is
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately persisting is with respect
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
to our Indigent defense
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
system um the engineed defense is
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
principally handled through the New
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public
 
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
defender uh they have experienced a
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
market increase in retention levels 262
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
per since 2010 of attorneys who are
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
leaving the office the retention rate
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
has decreased by that amount um and
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
that's combined with a case load that is
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
unrelenting and cases that are becoming
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
more resource intensive in part because
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
of the explosion of video evidence and
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of resources that consumes
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
for attorneys uh both in prosecution and
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
in defense uh the legislative budget
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
assistant conducted an audit one of its
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
regular audits of the judicial Council
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
last year in in
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
October uh released its report it's well
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
worth reading about the injured defense
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
system and it noted um that in March of
 
00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:14.670 align:start position:0%
system and it noted um that in March of
2024

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
um 20 to 40 incarcerated defendants were
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
awaiting appointment of council
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated defendants who are entitled
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
under both of our constitutions to Legal
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
represent ation the number for
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
non-incarcerated was 100 to
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
125 it is an issue not only of
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional Dimension and very
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
important to the defendants involved but
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
it also has impact on our entire Justice
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
System an attorney has no lawyer the
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
case cannot proceed and that effects
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
there are Ripple effects throughout the
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
system in both of our
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
courts next slide uh briefly addresses
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
our treatment courts
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's very important opportunity ongoing
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh with great help from the
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
legislature to uh
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
get treatment and services to those who
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
are flowing through our system so that
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
we don't see them again is basically the
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
idea our adult truck drug courts uh in
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
10 of our Superior location Court
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
locations with mental health courts in
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
both Superior and uh Circuit Court Court
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature authorized the
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
creation of a veterans court last year
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
which we were getting up and running
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
there was a really interesting pilot
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
program up in Sullivan uh family
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
treatment court for those families who
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
are involved in our abuse in a collect
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
system to get the services that they
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
need so that they um so that they can be
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
more successful and if they're
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
criminally involved can be more
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
successful court involved in um in not
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
coming back and and uh being reunited
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
with their families uh working with the
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
mayor of Manchester the circuit court is
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
trying to address uh in a creative and
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
Cooperative way the homeless issue down
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
there um I won't go into it but the uh
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
for the last couple of years systemwide
 
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
we've been engaged in a really important
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
initiative with respect to how the
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
courts can better respond to those
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing U mental
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
illness um across our state we're
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
conducting something called a sequential
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
interet mapping Workshop in each one of
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
our counties and it's basically an
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to identify where we can get
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
services to those who are either court
 
00:53:42.359 --> 00:53:43.510 align:start position:0%
services to those who are either court
involved

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
or at risk of being court involved to um
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
again get them the treatment they they
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
need the help that they need in a
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate setting so
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're not cycling back through our
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
system thereby increasing Public Safety
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
and saving public dollars and and most
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
importantly getting them the help that
 
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.789 align:start position:0%
importantly getting them the help that
they

00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
need another
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of opportunities another one
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
um um with the support of
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
Grant dollars we have been able to um
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
get up and running a very important
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
diversion program in the landlord tenant
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
area it's a case type in the Circuit
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
Court 7,000 cases really high success
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
rate both pre-filing and post filing uh
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
of mediating those cases and therefore
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
getting uh early resolution to benefit
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
both parties in those cases and avoid
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
the time and effort of litigating uh we
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
are seeking to next slide um 27 we're
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
seeking to leverage technology to the
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
greatest extent possible and the
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
superior court is moving to a platform
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
to uh whereby all evidence will be
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
presented uh
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
digitally finally um we are using text
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
technology uh and have a couple of pilot
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
programs to send text reminders in both
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
Crim certain criminal and civil cases um
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
in an effort to reduce failure to appear
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
cost the entire system when it when
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
someone does not appear affects
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
obviously the person involved but also
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
the entire system and there is huge
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
success in meeting people where they are
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
and reminding them through text which uh
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
is how most many of us communicate about
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
their time in court last slide is my
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%

and how someone gets access to to them
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of locating them and and being
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
represented yeah it's a uh the
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislature very specific statute that
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
setting forth the education requirements
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
the pair of professionals and the

attorneys within their office um they're
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
available in some but not all case types
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court but most
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
importantly the case types where we do
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
see a high volume and High High Vol
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
volum in high need uh based on
 
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.190 align:start position:0%
volum in high need uh based on
self-represented

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
self-represented
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
litigant um the principle the report
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
that we just released uh to the
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership uh identifies
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
that most of the par professionals who
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
have been involved in the program have
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
been associated with New Hampshire legal
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
assistance uh there has been one I I
 
00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
believe my memory is one private firm
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
that has used uh par Professionals in
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
this way so there is an enormous
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to expand the program um
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
and deploy it Beyond New Hampshire legal
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
assistance to uh to other uh
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
providers um and
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
um and I will just say you know ideally
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
we would want an attorney standing next
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
to every litigant in our court system
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
that is just not simply
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
possible but to have someone trained in
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
and supervised by an attorney standing
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
next to someone on a really important
 
00:58:33.029 --> 00:58:33.039 align:start position:0%
day in their life is better than not
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
having someone there and that's the
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
logic of this program it's the logic of
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
the of the statute uh we all strongly
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
supported this legislative initiative
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
and we think it has great opportunity to
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
help close the access to Justice Gap I
 
00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
hope that answered your question
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
representative representative Smith
 
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair could we consider
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm about to say as an
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
advertisement and not have it come out
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
of my questions I just want to say that
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
this comes from the incredibly focused
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
and committed work of a former chair of
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
this committee a former member of the
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and a former state
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
senator Ned Gordon who has been was
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
convinced for years that this would help
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
and this committee the the Judiciary
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
Committee worked very very hard for this
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
we had to deal with a little
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
um bump in the road that came having
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the merits of the
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill from members of the other body and
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
in the end we were delighted that we
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
were able to achieve this and if nothing
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
else it stands as a good example of good
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
work that this committee can do so
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's my advertisement it doesn't count
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
as my
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
questions I hope
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely not other yes representative
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
you um chief justice for taking my
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
question um one thing the Judiciary
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
Committee also has put into statute is a
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
new land use Docket in the um Superior
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
Court spe Court um can you talk to me a
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
little bit about how that docket has
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
functioned in the sense of um if it's
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
sped up a lot of the cases um and how it
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
how it's different than the housing
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
appeals board that we have also put into
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
your branch uh so I apologize don't have
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the the best data on that I think I
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
would be very happy to get get get it to
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
this committee uh we do have a dedicated
 
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.430 align:start position:0%
this committee uh we do have a dedicated
Superior

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
Superior
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
Court judge judge class who's sitting
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
happens to sit in
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um he
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
um has absorbed it took a while for him
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
to absorb all the volume of land use
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
cases uh but now that docket is fully up
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
and running to the extent he's not
 
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
hearing land use cases he does hear
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
other Superior Court cases I'm sorry
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative I just don't have the top
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
on the top of my head the volume of
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
cases or but we'd be I'd be happy to get
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
it to you yeah that would be great at
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
your convenience thank you other
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
handful of questions hopefully they
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
pretty simple I think um let me tackle
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
it one at a time first of all you assert
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
on slide 21 that we are subject to an
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
increased threat environment and I was
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk a bit more
 
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.309 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk a bit more
about

01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
that uh nationally we've seen uh some
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
really horrifying incidents involving um
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
courts um there was literally an
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
assassination of a family judge in his
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
driveway in Maryland in late of 2023
 
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.510 align:start position:0%
driveway in Maryland in late of 2023
um

01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
the um New Hampshire is not immune to
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
this it's been an increase in the
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
threats that we've received and the
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
threat and the and the um issues of
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
concern that we've had to deal with in
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
terms of our uh
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
security uh
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel um I think generally
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
um the environment that we are all
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
operating in is is challenging it really
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
is and and obviously we had a very
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunate incident at New Hampshire
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
hospital right here um I will note that
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
we have a courtroom in that facility so
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
it touched and it's right next door to
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
the conquered circuit court it's it
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
touched really close to home for
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
everyone in the judicial branch and um
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
and you know I I feel my number one
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to ensure do the best
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
we can and to make sure that we are
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
performing our constitutional duties in
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
in a place that is as safe as possible
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um you you talk about it
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
as as part of the function is that it
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department um separate or is it part of
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
Dennis gul's organization and um in the
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
context of that you you also talk about
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
movements towards more digital evidence
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
digital case management can you help us
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
understand the extent of your uh
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
Reliance and backup on paper uh or the
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know conversely the extent to which
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
were you to be subject to uh let's say a
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
ransomware attack that that removed
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
those systems from being available what
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
what impact would that have on the case
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
load to answer your first question is
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
separate uh Our IT department is
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
separate although we work closely with
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
there is there is some crossover
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
including some of our external facing
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
resources website and so on um we
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
we uh for many many years as the chair
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
knows we have been working on uh
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
deploying to an to an all electronic
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
platform in terms of case management and
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
filings Superior Court is all
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
electronic some but not all case types
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
in Circuit Court are electronic and we
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
hope to get to a place where we can be
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
fully deployed in electronics circuit
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
court has certain challenges there um we
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
do we are very aware of the external
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
threats um coming in um in terms of
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
accessing our system again I don't have
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
the data right off the top of my head uh
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
but it is it's it is of concern to our
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh it team and it's something that's
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
very very much on our radar screen uh I
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
will say that the um the benefits of
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
investing in in electronic case
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
management were born out during the
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh when we were able to Pivot
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
to a quasi virtual environment pretty
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
quickly uh and it was the investment in
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
electronic case management coupled with
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
um our a call center we have a central
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
call center to handle all trial court
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
inquiries and it was those two
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
Investments and uh and initiatives both
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
of which had the support of the
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
legislature that really enabled us to
 
01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
efficiently handle cases in a in a
 
01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:31.910 align:start position:0%
efficiently handle cases in a in a
different

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
environment thank you uh final question
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh did you you mentioned the
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
non-competitive fee structure with
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
regard to the the public defender office
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
and Eng dependence um can you give us a
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
sense as to quantitatively how
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
non-competitive it is and what your
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
expectation is as to what would be
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
needed to turn the corner on that I'm
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
sorry how what they the non-competitive
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
fee structure for the public defendant
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
office uh the average salary of a public
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
defender is I believe
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
$57,000 um they
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
can I think if you have the judicial
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
Council in here they will tell you a
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
principal concern is the um analog
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
organization in Massachusetts which can
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
pay considerably
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
higher um I think you will see in uh
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
from the judicial Council to address
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
this problem and get the salaries up to
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
where they believe it should be it's
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
roughly an $8 million
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
problem um but that and although it's
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
called the judicial Council it's an
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency but they they
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
among other things do superintend our uh
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
engineed vense
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
system 8.3 million is my memory
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
Smith um congratulations to you on um on
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
having your uh judicial your count of
 
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.870 align:start position:0%
having your uh judicial your count of
Judges

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
Judges
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
where you are I don't want to say you
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
would want it to be but where you're
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
willing to accept that it is considering
 
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.349 align:start position:0%
willing to accept that it is considering
it

01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
full um some of us did put a take a
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
particularly Deep dive into the work of
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
the family court um and one of the
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
things we discovered that we believe
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
also affects the other courts is is that
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
the problem is not necessarily the
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
number of Judges but it is the absence
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
of support for those judges so that
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
judges are doing the work that could
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
better be done by people with other
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
training and other skills therefore
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
freeing the judges to be more judge
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
likee so I want to ask you a very direct
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
question um because you're privy to
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
information we're not privy to yet and
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is have you asked the Governor to
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
include in the governor's budget
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
additional staff
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
support for the judges in all three
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
levels of the judicial branch well no
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
actually two levels of the judicial
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
branch not the not the Supreme because
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court does I think have
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
adequate support yeah um just for the I
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
agree with your observations
 
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I think thank you
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's the first time today oh good
 
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.669 align:start position:0%
it's the first time today oh good
okay

01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh I think what the special committee
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
identified was in particular a lack of
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
Staff attorneys or the or the how staff
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys could benefit the Circuit
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
Court in dealing with its highly
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
specialized subject matter jurisdiction
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
and there are three staff attorneys now
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
and I think and I know you're a real
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
leader on this representative Smith in
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
terms of wanting more resource
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
in there the answer is
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
no um given the Mandate that we were
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
given uh in terms of the budget request
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
we're not able to include additional um
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
staff attorneys into the budget we have
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
identified it as a prioritized need it's
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
a huge priority for me personally but I
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
but in the interest being transparent
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative that that is where uh we
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
landed thank a couple of quick ones on
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
page 2 2 you talk about private
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
contractors I was a little confused
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
because I thought that all of those
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
cases had to do with
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
YDC no so many of them involve other
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
entities that delivered services to
 
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
these youth that were involved some are
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
just YDC other involved defendants that
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
may be may have provided services to YDC
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
or were contracted out by the state to
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
deliver services to the particular youth
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
involved and they are defendants in
 
01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:00.030 align:start position:0%
involved and they are defendants in
those

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
cases thank you and one very quick
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
question I hope um and it has to do with
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the corps and
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
the bar association I believe that the
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
phrase that's used is that we have a
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
unified bar in um in New Hampshire and
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
that the uh as a result the bar
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
association is really not independent
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's part of um the the court um at how
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
does that differ from what we see in
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
other states and could you just tell me
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
idea uh you don't have to answer you
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
know any of these
 
01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
know any of these
questions

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh there are two flavors
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
out there among the 50 plus
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions one is to have a unified
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
bar and this is a statutory mandate it's
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
actually in statute that all all
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
practicing attorneys must be members of
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bar Association that's
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
called a unified bar can't remember how
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
many states off the top of my head
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
follow that system the other is to have
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
voluntary bar
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
associations where you can if you want
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
to be a member of a bar in in a
 
01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
to be a member of a bar in in a
particular

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
State the unified bar uh is I think part
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
of its intent and purpose is to assist
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
the court in um in
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
administering the attorney population in
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping track of who they are
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
their addresses whether they've met
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
their clle requirements and so on it
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
serves that administrative function for
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
the court and I do think um you know it
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
delivers value in that respect attorneys
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
are assessed a
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
fee for being members of New Hampshire
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
bar and that fee is approved by the
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and we do review the
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
budget of the bar association and make a
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
determination about the
 
01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:15.590 align:start position:0%
determination about the
fee

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave it at that it my one
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
little question about that is do you
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
think that that in any way um might put
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a crimp in the
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
willingness of um of a
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
licensed appropriately licensed attorney
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to um raise a
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
question about some of the
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
procedures um within the judicial branch
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
and since they are the people who are
 
01:12:53.229 --> 01:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
most knowledgeable certainly more than
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of us because they're actually
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
in involved in the court system that
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
that denies us um uh means of
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
accountability that many of us believe
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
because uh because they are subject to
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
branch because of
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
natural uh unwillingness to want to um
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
stir the pot
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
quite apart from the the nature of bar
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
associations and whether you're unified
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
or voluntary in every
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
state state Supreme Courts have taken
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
the position that the regulation of the
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
practice of law is a matter of within
 
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
the exclusive jurisdiction of the
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
judicial branch stemming from judges
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
organic authority to regulate what
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
happens in the courtroom so I'm not sure
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the to the extent you've identified
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
an issue I'm not sure that the form of a
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
bar association would make a difference
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
because attorneys in every state are
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately subject to the authority of
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
judges in the way that they are admitted
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the bar the way they are disciplined
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
their education requirements to the
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
extent they exist that's all in
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
exclusive judicial branch function well
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for that answer
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
there are many of us who believe that
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch should be
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for its own um rules and
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
that wasn't too bad was it
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
NOK you uh representative Morton and
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
then uh representative for please thank
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
you chair and thank you chief justice
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the question uh it's two part uh
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
first uh we were talking about access to
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
Justice and you mentioned you know it's
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
an important day in someone's life in as
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
an example I graduate high High School
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
on one day it was the important day in
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
my life never had a second you know
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
graduation from high
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
school with uh people that are in the
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
criminal court system how many important
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
days are some of these people having is
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
it the 10th time is it and is there a
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
correlation the part B of that to a
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
certain type of representation and
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
so just to step back under our
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
constitution if you are criminally
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
accused for the most part you're
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to an attorney under the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that goes to the issue
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
identified with our engine defense
 
01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
system we're not there's simply not
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
enough attorneys in that system right
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
now to represent all those in need in
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on the Civil side with
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
just a few exceptions
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
if you were involved in the court system
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're on your own in terms of hiring a
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer and in the Circuit Court which I
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned up to 90% on any given day are
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
self-represented they're dealing with
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
just real in immediate cases
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
involving the people we all
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
serve landlord tenant keeping a
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
house you know
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
shelter small claims which for many
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
people can be
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
significant uh divorce and
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
parent domestic
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
violence you're going into the case
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
these courts by
 
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
yourself uh when I was a practicing
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
attorney I did as many pro bono cases as
 
01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.830 align:start position:0%
attorney I did as many pro bono cases as
I

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
could and um I I did them particularly
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the domestic violence area area
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
and when I was a practicing attorney I
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
even though I'd been practicing for many
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
had uh I got nervous walking into
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
court but can you imagine if you're
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
standing there trying to protect your
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
yourself your family trying to keep the
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
roof over your head in a completely
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
foreign environment
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
where they speak a special language and
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're specially
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
trained that's the issue that we're
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
trying to address and that's why I think
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature's initiative with
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
respect to pair of professionals is so
 
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
important you can't get a lawyer there
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen anytime soon
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
but if you can get legally trained
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
people in there standing next to the
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
person on that
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
day it can make a real difference
 
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.390 align:start position:0%
day it can make a real difference
representative

01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
Horgan um yes thank you very much M Mr
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chief justice um I was just
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit curious about this pilot
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
program um about recidivism about people
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
no people failing to show up at the
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
hearings which uh subject has been my
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
mind for a few months because uh this
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
fall um I went attended the do District
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
Court um I was there because there were
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
several defendants who'd been um who've
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
been arrested for trespassing in
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
Congressman Pap's office and they um you
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
know chose to exercise the right to
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
trial so they could like speak in their
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
behalf and of course they all showed up
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
although I think they had a volunteer
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
attorney didn't show up I was surprised
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
in that case there the judge uh was
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
Judge Sako Gardner of the Circuit Court
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
who seemed like a very very good judge
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
he uh had all the regular cases with
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
people you know who with lower profile
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
cases and um quite a few of them quite a
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
few of them
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
simply failed to show up so is uh so
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
problem it's a problem primarily here
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
that they don't get the word on when
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to show up or they
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
forget and they have the text messages
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
or there perhaps other things that need
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
to be done like possibly uh changing the
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
way the courts work for the people or I
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
hate to put any more people in in prison
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
we already have too many people
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated but possibly increasing the
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh the penalties for when you fail fail
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
to appear cuz this this was a that was a
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
revelation to me because the only other
 
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
time in recent years been to a circuit
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
court was a very also high-profile case
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
which is serve a special circumstance
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
because there's a well-known State Rep
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
who sadly has since passed away who was
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
pleading guilty to simple assault and
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
she actually even ironically happened to
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
be a former County attorney so that case
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
they put her first in the docket and you
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
know so we they went and spent about
 
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
half an hour doing their thing and she
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
went home and we all went home and the
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
regular defendants you
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
know well process afterwards but it was
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
different the second time because we
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
were seeing all the regular defendants
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
and as I said I was kind of a little bit
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
shocked that so many of them like simply
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
didn't show up so so so you they're
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
called ftas failure appear and you've
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
seen the real life consequence of how
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
disruptive it is for the court system
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
but it also creates another potential
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
encounter for the the accused because
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
they failed to appear and so Tech this
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
technology has great promise and as I
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
said in the slide uh we deployed it in
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
cases and ftas have been reduced by 40%
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
so we're we we're very hopeful about
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
this and would we you know to address
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
this problem so thank you for your
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
question that that does sound like a
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
fairly lowcost and relatively simple
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
intervention and if it makes that big a
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
difference and that's definitely a good
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
thing so thanks representative
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chief justice for taking my question
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with felony first and
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering if you could just
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
expand upon
 
01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
laughing

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
laughing
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
um in prior to
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
2016 all criminal cases including
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
felonies began in circuit court for a
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
hearing um the legislature enacted
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in that provided beginning
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
in 20
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
16 um that would shift over to Superior
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
Court where felonies are
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
prosecuted um I won't it was a policy
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
determination in that instance by the
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislature and then uh I think it was
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
um presented a bill to repeal that's my
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
memory it was representative Gordon to
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
repeal felonies first in 2022
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
and after consideration by this
 
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee um that was the termination of
 
01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
committee um that was the termination of
the

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
legislature I I don't want to
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
characterize the evidence or or comment
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
on that policy decision but I think one
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the things and the chair probably
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
comment on this one of the things that
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
the committee heard was when cases were
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
first brought in Circuit Court it
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
created an opportunity it perceived
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to resolve those cases
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that that
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity either didn't exist or was
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
put off and was not being maximized when
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
those first encounters shifted to
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and I think that was part
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
of what led the legislature to make its
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
decision although no I think that I
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
think you're absolutely right I think
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's that was that was one of the
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
arguments for sure yeah so um the
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
legislature made the decision to rewind
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
felonies first so we're b b back to the
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
status quo and
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
cases are beginning in circuit court now
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
and that is as of January 1st
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
2024 other other questions
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
sorry so red means talk thank
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
you I've heard a lot of great things I
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
was just curious just because I'm on the
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
school board Manchester and we're always
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
discussing Staffing par professionals so
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
I was curious if that's sort of a an
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
issue and I was curious what role they
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
played like I can imagine based on what
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
you said but I was just kind of curious
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
about that because I already had like
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
three ideas in my head as to how we
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
could always keep the you know keep our
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
turnover low for Paras but I'm just
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
curious if that's something you're
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh I'm
 
01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.229 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh I'm
sorry

01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing CU you said you're
 
01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
experiencing CU you said you're
partnering

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
partnering
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
with for perz you said who was the
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
organization New Hampshire legal
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
assistance is yeah all right I was just
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
kind of curious about that because I
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
know it's a challenge for a lot of
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
districts I was just curious if you're
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing the same thing uh to my
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge no but
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for training them
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%

01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%

01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
organizations either Law Firm or or in
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%

01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
assistance which is a law firm other
 
01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:29.750 align:start position:0%

question yes representative McFarland

thank you one last question um I I know
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
that uh you know as we've been talking
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
about everyone deserves their right at a
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
fair defense um and I I'm sure that that
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
is part of the consideration that
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
applies to associate Supreme Court
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
Justice Marcone at what point does the I
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we can get into anything
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
about any any you know anything about
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
any pending cases yeah I wasn't going to
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
ask anything about the case Mr chairman
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
okay my my question is simply at what
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
point does the absence of one of our
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
associat Supreme Court Justices uh start
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
to cause a problem I understand we have
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
the practice of uh appointing others on
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
a rotating basis um is there a point at
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
which we should appoint somebody on a a
 
01:26:36.639 --> 01:26:42.390 align:start position:0%
which we should appoint somebody on a a
protm

01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
basis um we have established procedures
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
um disqualifications or absences by
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
justices and we follow those it's
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually set forth
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
statute uh so that's the procedure that
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
we handle that we follow uh in terms of
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the productivity the Supreme Court um as
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
I related we
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
have disposed of in 2024 752 cases that
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
is the most we've disposed of since
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
2015 so uh there are es and flows in the
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
membership of anybody any court and uh
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
you just deal with the
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
workload all right all right thank you

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
like where you're from why you're
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
interested in the Judiciary Committee uh
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
your High service that kind of
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
thing good morning pleasure to meet
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
everybody that I haven't met well I
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
think I've met most everybody except for
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of you um but this is my second
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
term I'm from winam I didn't say at the
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
and I guess you know after sitting on
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
the committee last year there were quite
 
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
a few interesting things that kind of
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
came up that I
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
felt are really important in the
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
judicial system and and that kind of
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
just got me interested in in the
 
01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.950 align:start position:0%
just got me interested in in the
committee

01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you and representative
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
Virg thank
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
you I'm Dan the reason why I'm sitting
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
in this chair is because someone
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
suggested it for one thing which I'm
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
glad that they did I like I said about
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
the the school board so I felt like some
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
of that because I've been doing it for
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
six terms sort of feeds into what here
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
as far as respect and follow the rules
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
and once I know them all but um so I was
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
asked to run for this and I
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
thought that's a great way to represent
 
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
my ward and my district simply because I
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
do both the education and the
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
legislative part so I think that's the
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm here thank you thank you
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
all right um I think i' I think we have
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else do we have anybody
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
else oh no she she she spoke you spoke y
 
01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.590 align:start position:0%
else oh no she she she spoke you spoke y
she

01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
introduced um are these phone numbers
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
just for the committee's consumption or
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
would they be
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
public um I for my per if you didn't put
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
your phone number on the you know on the
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
website then as far as I'm concerned you
 
01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
didn't want your phone number to be
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
public so I'm not GNA you know I'm not
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to publish that to the uh to the
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
outside world um so you know what I want
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
to say I want to go back and just follow
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
up on the time issue um I guess based
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
upon what I've heard it seems like most
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
people would prefer to start at 10: I
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is this okay I
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
will unless there is what I considered
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
to be sort of a really compelling reason
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
to start at 9: I will not start at 9: as
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
between 9:30 and 10: I'm I'll sort of
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
think about I guess uh for for what I
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
would say is uh you'll notice that I
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
have I sent out an email this morning
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
I've scheduled some hearings for the
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
29th and I did schedule those for 9:30
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
and that's because I knew I I knew that
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
one person that was particularly
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about because of the time was
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Birch and he's he's not
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to be with us that week um so that
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to any reason not to start
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
at 9:30 that week but uh for going
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
forward I'll I'll sort of think about it
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
it'll be generally will be between
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
either 9:30 or 10 the other thing oh I'm
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
sorry no I'm sorry if we are going to be
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
scheduling an executive session
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
right would that be a 10 that
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
I I think I would generally try to
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
particularly if it was going to be just
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
an executive session yes I think that
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
would make that would make sense to do
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
that um because that's not that is not
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
something that would likely be we're not
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
going to be going into the late you know
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
five o'clock in the evening on an
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
executive side I hope it's not at least
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
I hope not um uh so that brings me this
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
all brings me to a very important thing
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
that I want to let everybody know about
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
and and the the speaker knows about it
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative man knows about it and
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Smith knows about it but
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
you probably all don't know about this
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why I am going to be
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
gone from February 5th to February 24th
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
so that means three Wednesdays I'm going
 
01:32:07.629 --> 01:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
to be gone and uh representative Manion
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
will be in we're going to have hearings
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
during that time I intend I intend just
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
so you understand I intend to schedule
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
after Consulting with representative
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
Manion and representative Smith I intend
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
to schedule hearings for all of those
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
three weeks um it'll be you know you'll
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
be here on Wednesday these for full days
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
on those but I will not be here and
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's because I have a longstanding uh
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a longstanding plans to go on a trip
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
to Thailand and Vietnam and Cambodia and
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
so that's where I will be uh for for
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
those for those three weeks um and as I
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
said you know I again I understand I
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
particular M representative McFarland I
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
understand that you know and and others
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
I understand you you have you have other
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
lives and I you know completely
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
understand that sometime you have to you
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
have to either for business reasons or
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
other other reasons you may not be able
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
to be here I completely understand that
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
um but I will would we figure there
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
would not be exact sessions one yeah you
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
know what what I suggested is um and I'm
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk further to
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
representative Manion and and
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith about this but my
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
inclination is on anything that you know
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
appears that there's going to be a
 
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
debate so to speak that that we wait
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
until so I'm back to have the executive
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
session on that if there are some things
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
that you again I go back to
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative tur's Bill if you know if
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
that came up on that on the time and
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
everybody said you know wait a minute
 
01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
this is a no-brainer Let's either do it
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
or let's not do it fine you should do
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
that I have complete confidence in
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Manion and representative
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
Smith that uh to use your uh your good
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
judgment on those kind of things um all
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
right so that would mean there um Mr
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
chairman that we would not have
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on um complex bills
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
until the first week in March till the F
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
until the first week because because we
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
will have we will not have that during
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
the um that vacation the vacation yes
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
because I in other words I will be back
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
on Monday I think it's Monday February
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
24th but that's the week that we will
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
not the house will not be U sitting so
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
we will be the next time we will you
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
know get together will be the will be
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
the the following week now as I say as
 
01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about this and I'm trying
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
to put together the schedule um it may
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
be that sometime in early March
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
particularly if there are some early
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
bills that we you know that we need to
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh that we need to exec or whatever that
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
we may have to um uh have an executive
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
session on a Monday in in you know
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
either that first week or second week
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
but I'll I'll try to avoid that if at
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
all possible because I don't you know if
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
we can if we going to particularly
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander who's got
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
another another chairmanship uh on the
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
housing committee which is going to be
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
pretty busy I will I will try to avoid
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
having two days if it's all possible but
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
I can't guarantee it um all right uh
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
let's see let me go what else do I that
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about here
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I I went over the Executive session
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
issue um oh so you know that the this is
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
you you may have
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
already uh particularly on on on
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's side of the aisle
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
she may have already discussed this with
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
you I have not discussed it with my uh
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
folks on my side of but but just as a
 
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.350 align:start position:0%
folks on my side of but but just as a
general

01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
thing I think it will usually be the
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
practice that before there is an
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
executive session each myself for the
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
Republicans representative Smith for uh
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
for uh the Democrats or it my absence uh
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative Manion for the
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
Republicans will have a caucus usually I
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
did it last year and I would probably do
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
it again this year would do it uh by
 
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
Zoom uh you know
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
the the night before a couple of days
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
before whatever where we'll kind of go
 
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
over uh the bills that we're going to be
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
executing and get some sense of what um
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
people's position are are on the bills
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
and U and the same would be true on the
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh on the on Dem itic side and I you
 
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.870 align:start position:0%
uh on the on Dem itic side and I you
know

01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
I let me just I let me say this because
 
01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
I um this is this is from my
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
perspective from my perspective on the
 
01:36:37.119 --> 01:36:38.669 align:start position:0%
perspective from my perspective on the
Republican

01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
Republican
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
side if if some Bill is a priority of
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
the leadership of the house I'm going to
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
tell you that that's true and that
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know this is what the um what
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
the leadership would like to have happen
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
I don't try to Strongarm anybody you do
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
what you want to do um I will tell you
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
that you know if something is important
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the leadership that that's that's a
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
significant thing to consider personally
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
there are you know there are there are
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
things where I might personally think H
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know about this but it's
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
important to leadership and and it and
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not so opposed to it that I'm that
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna you know if leadership wants
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
it I'm going to go along with it because
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's you know that I think that that's
 
01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
kind of part of what comes with with
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
being a committee chair on the other
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
hand there are some things where I just
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
feel so strongly that you know I just
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
can't do it and I expect that all of you
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
have that same view also I don't know
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
what the situation is on the Democratic
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
side I leave that to representative
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
Smith and she doesn't you guys don't
 
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
have to tell me and I shouldn't know
 
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:50.910 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair to
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair to
[Laughter]

01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just say this would be a
 
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
great conversation to have in a
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
republican caucus I'm sure it would I'm
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
sure it would um all right yes um if I
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
if of the rumors we've been hearing are
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
true you'll probably miss two session
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
days so I suppose as a courtesy to you
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
if there's anything we think might come
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
down to one vote one way or the other
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
you'd rather have us uh put that off and
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
get it out of the way wait till after
 
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
you come back or not session well I you
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
know I don't have I don't have
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure what the speaker intends
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
to do on session he knows that I'm not
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to be here and I he'll you know
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
he'll make his decision uh yes
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
you we have a couple of bills coming to
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
us that are going to require a
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time like last year
 
01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time like last year
in

01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
hearings I would
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
hope that those bills when people come
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
to speak speak are able to speak and
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
interruption I had a lot of complaints
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
from people last year when we stopped
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing and told people to come back
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
hours later and I would hope that we
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
learned from
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
our mistakes in that and that that does
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
not happen again
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
here I well I guess all I could say all
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
I can say is this we I mean just you've
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
probably seen I assume one of the things
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is the end of life
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
Bill absolutely yeah so that has been
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
scheduled for January 29th at 1 p.m. uh
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
we'll start at 1M and we'll you know
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
we'll go that's the last bill of the day
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
that is the last bill of the day that's
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm I didn't look to see what had
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
been scheduled um okay and I you know I
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
suspect um
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
probably um sometime after that uh we're
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to have there I think I think we
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
have at least one maybe actually two
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe more uh because we haven't gotten
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
all the bills yet abortion bills I
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
suspect those are going to take up uh
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
you know those are going to take up some
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
time too and in fact for next week we
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
have some right to no bills I you know I
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
suspect some of those may may take some
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
time and uh I'm just asking for an inter
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
not an interruption in people who come
 
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
to vote come to to a hearing that
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
they're not told to come back later
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's all well I you know I mean I I
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
can't guarantee that but we'll do the
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
best we can sure okay thank you all
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
right other um let me me see what else I
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:40:25.599 --> 01:40:29.870 align:start position:0%
wanted to
uh

01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
um all right the last thing I want to
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
and then I want to answer any questions
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
or have any discussion you might want to
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
have but the last thing I want to um
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
talk about is as several people
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I'm very proud of the fact
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
that um last year our committee we had
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
very strong disagreements as you as
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
people who are here uh will remember
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
remember we had any number of bills that
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
came that came out of the committee with
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
no recommendation uh because we were
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
split 10 we had 20 people on the
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee at that time it was 10 to 10
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and um so there's no question that
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee then and
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the members of the committee
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
now have very uh different ideas on
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
things and I that's fine that's what
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
democracy is all about but I think it's
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
really important that both in dealing
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
with the public that is you know
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses or people that are here in the
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
room and just as important with each
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
other that we treat each other with
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect um it's you know I
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
regard representative Smith as my friend
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
and as a member of the loyal opposition
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
and I hope she regards me the same way
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that's the way I regard all of you
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
so uh and I hope you will uh all have
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
that same mindset there are no enemies
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
here they're just people who have
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
different views um and it's really
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
important I think for the public that
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
they understand that this you know we
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
legislature um it's not some bar room uh
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
and we need to be a acting like it's a
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
place where we treat each other with
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect and that's about all
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
I have to say um representative Perez
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I have one more question
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
when you're away and we're doing
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
hearings are you also going to put at
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom of them that an executive
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
session might be available if we have
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
something that's a very benign bill that
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
we all are in GLE we can do that right
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
now as I said yes I am I think you
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
should and by the way you know I'm I'm
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
planning to be I I obviously I can't say
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
for sure what the internet availability
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be particularly in Cambodia
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
or Vietnam but Thailand Maybe a little
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
different but I'm going to try to keep
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
up with what's going on and be available
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
if representative Manion wants to talk
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
to me or you know email me or whatever
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
how successful that will be I don't know
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to try um all right are
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
there is there are there things we
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed that anybody wants to
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
talk about just yes represent me and we
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
haven't talked about this so I'm not
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
sure how you run it here but I know in
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
criminal justice when we're asking
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh of people here to testify
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
that we ask one question not I have two
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
or three or four of them it just gives
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
other people on the uh on the committee
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
time to speak yeah no no no that that
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's true I didn't that that is the
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
process we should follow if you if you
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
have a question ask the question if you
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
have a followup you can ask to have a
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
followup um and generally it's going to
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
be fine but if there are a whole bunch
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
of people that all have questions I
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
might say wait a minute hang off hang on
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
on your followup let's let somebody else
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
ask a question first um but gen yeah
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
um oh yes represent B I actually have a
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
comment I wanted to apologize for being
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
late but I sat there in the governor's
 
01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
office because it said 208 on it so I
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
don't even know what lb stands for to be
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
quite honest with you so I apologize no
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
no no problem no you know the other
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
thing to say the other thing I that
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
really raises a good question you know I
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
had I had a lot of experience in
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
judicial procedures based on my career
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the I had very little experience in
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
legislative procedures when I got here
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
and in fact I still don't don't by any
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
means consider myself to be an expert on
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
on legislative procedure so you're going
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
to find a number of times when I'm when
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to representative Smith and
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
saying okay what what's the rule here
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
what am I supposed to because she's been
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
here for 25 years or more than that um
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
and uh don't rub it in and so um I guess
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
what I'm my point here is the there are
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned there are no
 
01:44:57.310 --> 01:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
dumb questions if you have a question
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
about how something should operate don't
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
feel embarrassed to ask it uh we you
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
know it's important that you feel
 
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable and you know that everybody
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
kind of knows what knows what uh what
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
the score sheet is so to speak other
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
than that um anything else before we uh
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%

03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
um all right I'm going to uh call the uh
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee back to order and uh
 
03:05:57.550 --> 03:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
commence the hearing on uh HB 88 uh FN
 
03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh relative to establishing community
 
03:06:02.429 --> 03:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
property trusts and I will recognize uh
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative Dan
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:06:09.150 --> 03:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire I represent the
 
03:06:10.110 --> 03:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
town of
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
epom so
 
03:06:16.269 --> 03:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
um this B bill is motivated by a
 
03:06:19.030 --> 03:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
situation that could occur to a New
 
03:06:21.389 --> 03:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire widow or
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
widower um where they would be at a
 
03:06:26.590 --> 03:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantage regarding federal tax
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
compared to someone in the exact same
 
03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
situation who lives in California or
 
03:06:34.830 --> 03:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
some other state right so this is a a
 
03:06:38.510 --> 03:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
solution or a possible solution um for
 
03:06:41.630 --> 03:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
such a person uh it's a tool that lets
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
them fix that uh while the person's
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
still married right so they would have
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
to act while they're married in order
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
for this to happen so to give you the
 
03:06:53.469 --> 03:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
background I'm going to have to explain
 
03:06:57.229 --> 03:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
some things about federal income tax uh
 
03:07:00.269 --> 03:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
number one is there's a there's a part
 
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
of the income tax is a capital gains tax
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
so a capital gains tax is if you own
 
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
something typically real estate could be
 
03:07:12.429 --> 03:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
stocks could be bonds could be art could
 
03:07:15.550 --> 03:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
be anything and and over the lifetime
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
that you own it the value of that thing
 
03:07:20.630 --> 03:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
goes up in in value and you so you buy
 
03:07:22.710 --> 03:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
it for one price you sell it for another
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
price you owe a tax uh the capital gains
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
tax on the difference and the the amount
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the tax varies depending on the time
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
you owned it and uh the amount of your
 
03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
your other taxes things like that but
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's what a capital gains tax is it's
 
03:07:42.190 --> 03:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
a tax on the difference in value when
 
03:07:44.110 --> 03:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
something goes up you know when it goes
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
down you have a negative um capital gain
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
which you can write off other capital
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
gains but but in general when something
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
goes up you you will in general owe a
 
03:07:57.750 --> 03:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
tax on that capital gain now what if you
 
03:08:01.150 --> 03:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
receive property by inheritance right
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
your your uncle dies you know your uncle
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
owns 100 shares of Microsoft he bought
 
03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
it for
 
03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
$100 it's now worth
 
03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
$1,000 um and uh he dies and leaves it
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
to you okay um and you sell it do you
 
03:08:21.389 --> 03:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
have a $900 capital gain the answer is
 
03:08:25.150 --> 03:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
no so when you receive property from an
 
03:08:28.950 --> 03:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
inheritance at you your basis your your
 
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
kind of starting point for that property
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
is the value on the day you got it so it
 
03:08:36.670 --> 03:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
was worth $1,000 when you got it you
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
sell it for $1,000 there's no no gain no
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
tax okay um if there is any tax owed in
 
03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
this situation it would be on your
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
uncle's estate it wouldn't be part of
 
03:08:51.229 --> 03:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
you okay in but in general there isn't a
 
03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
tax okay so those are the the two Basics
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
so let me give you an example of how a a
 
03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
widow or widower can get hurt so this is
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
on this paper I handed out here suppose
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Mrs same example Mr Mrs Jones buy a
 
03:09:08.790 --> 03:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
$100 worth of stock and they put it in
 
03:09:10.830 --> 03:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
their joint brokerage account so they
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
have an account with Fidelity or Schwab
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
or one of those things they buy a stock
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
so over time the value of this stock
 
03:09:21.630 --> 03:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
becomes a th000 okay um then Mr Jones
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
dies and Mrs Jones inherits the stock
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
and then Mrs Jones sells the stock for
 
03:09:32.309 --> 03:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
$1,000 okay now if the Joneses happen to
 
03:09:34.590 --> 03:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
live in California or another community
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
property State then um they get what's
 
03:09:41.790 --> 03:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
called a step up in basis for all
 
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
Inherited property including this kind
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
of property community property so so Mrs
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
Jones would then own the stock with a
 
03:09:53.190 --> 03:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
value with a basis of $1,000 a starting
 
03:09:56.429 --> 03:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
point of $1,000 she sells it for $1,000
 
03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
no no gain no tax okay but if Mrs Jon if
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
the Joneses live in New Hampshire then
 
03:10:07.710 --> 03:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
the way the IRS treats this is that Mrs
 
03:10:11.070 --> 03:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
Jones owned half of it from the start Mr
 
03:10:13.910 --> 03:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
Jones owned half of it from the start so
 
03:10:16.590 --> 03:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
the so the half that Mrs Jones gets from
 
03:10:19.190 --> 03:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Jones that has a step up in basis
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
right so it as far as Mrs Jones is
 
03:10:23.349 --> 03:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
concerned it's worth five she got it
 
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
when it was worth $500 it's still worth
 
03:10:29.070 --> 03:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
$500 no tax on that part but when she
 
03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
sells her own part that she got for
 
03:10:36.510 --> 03:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
$50 and now sells it for $500 there's a
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
$450 capital gain and she would out tax
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
on that so so and the only difference in
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
my example is she you know living in New
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus living in in California
 
03:10:49.389 --> 03:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
or one of these other community property
 
03:10:53.950 --> 03:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
States so um so what this bill does is
 
03:10:58.110 --> 03:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
allow someone a married couple to create
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
a trust with this community property
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
feature and they could put this stock or
 
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
any other property into the trust one of
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
them dies the other inherits and the
 
03:11:11.469 --> 03:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
entire value of the trust gets the Step
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
Up in basis so they wouldn't owe a
 
03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
federal capital gains
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
tax okay it's totally optional it's a
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
new kind of trust it exists in some
 
03:11:24.750 --> 03:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
other states so now why do we have this
 
03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
weird you know federal tax situation it
 
03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
has to do it's I can get into it with
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions if you want but it it has to
 
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
do with the history of how laws were
 
03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
created in the various States and some
 
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
states have this kind of feature for all
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
married coup's property all right and
 
03:11:45.229 --> 03:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
those states are called community
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
property States and there's a list of
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
them here
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
Arizona California Idaho Louisiana
 
03:11:53.469 --> 03:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
Nevada New Mexico Texas Washington and
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin now Wisconsin is the
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
interesting one of that group because
 
03:12:00.750 --> 03:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
the others all started with community
 
03:12:04.150 --> 03:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
property from day one but Wisconson in
 
03:12:07.550 --> 03:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
the 70s switched from being like New
 
03:12:09.510 --> 03:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to being like these other
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
states and they did it deliberately for
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
this exact reason for this this tax
 
03:12:17.950 --> 03:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
reason um and when I was originally in
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature like 12 years ago I
 
03:12:22.269 --> 03:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
proposed that we do the same thing like
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin but um the legislature didn't
 
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
want to basically because it was too big
 
03:12:30.030 --> 03:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
a change right it would Chang everything
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
right it changes all of these kind of
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
property matters so we didn't do it but
 
03:12:38.950 --> 03:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the meantime since then um this
 
03:12:40.910 --> 03:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
alternative method of getting this
 
03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
feature but only getting it optionally
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
and if you want it came came about and
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
since and these other five states have
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
adopted community property trusts as a
 
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
as a feature of their states and those
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
are the states of Alaska Florida
 
03:12:59.990 --> 03:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
Kentucky South Dakota and Tennessee so
 
03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is modeled on what we have for
 
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
Tennessee uh I think they were one of
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
the first that to do this and um it
 
03:13:09.670 --> 03:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
would just add us to that particular
 
03:13:12.510 --> 03:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
list as having this kind of a trust be
 
03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
an option for people to have now what I
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
find interesting about this list is
 
03:13:19.349 --> 03:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
except for Kentucky these are all other
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
states that don't have um their own
 
03:13:25.150 --> 03:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
state income tax so I think it's people
 
03:13:29.229 --> 03:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
who are more sensitive to their citizens
 
03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
paying federal income tax right I mean
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're it's on their minds I guess and
 
03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
it also um because they themselves don't
 
03:13:39.630 --> 03:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
have capital gains taxes then this
 
03:13:42.030 --> 03:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect them themselves it's
 
03:13:45.830 --> 03:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
only about federal tax okay um now one
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
thing you might notice in the bill it
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal note which says that uh the
 
03:13:53.790 --> 03:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
amount the cost of the bill is
 
03:13:53.800 --> 03:13:55.309 align:start position:0%
amount the cost of the bill is
indeterminate

03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
indeterminate
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
because it might uh preclude uh certain
 
03:14:03.790 --> 03:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh real estate transfer tax payments now
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
I actually think that when you for
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
estate planning purposes create a trust
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
and put put in property into that trust
 
03:14:16.510 --> 03:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
then that isn't a a real estate transfer
 
03:14:19.950 --> 03:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
tax event but it's something I'm I'm not
 
03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
authoritative on that so so I tend to
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
think you know you're effectively taking
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
property you own and giving it to
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
yourself under a different name so there
 
03:14:31.950 --> 03:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a real estate transfer tax
 
03:14:34.030 --> 03:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh event there you know it's only when
 
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
you sell a property to somebody else
 
03:14:37.710 --> 03:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
then there that's a real estate transfer
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
tax so I think this is really no no cost
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
but um that's something I could look up
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
and and find out more about if you
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
thought it was significant I tend to
 
03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
think if we didn't have the provision in
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
there to to say this is not a real
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax event then probably
 
03:14:59.070 --> 03:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
very few people would Avail themselves
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
of this feature I mean it's a nice to
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
have it's not
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
a end of the world kind of thing okay so
 
03:15:08.070 --> 03:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's the fiscal note and then um I
 
03:15:10.110 --> 03:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
have an amendment for you so it's brand
 
03:15:12.750 --> 03:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
new bill but but in the meantime after
 
03:15:15.910 --> 03:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
we created the bill um I was contacted
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
by the bankers and Association and they
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out that it it it there's a
 
03:15:24.630 --> 03:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
there's a flaw in the bill in that
 
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
suppose one uh the husband or wife owns
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
a piece of property that has a mortgage
 
03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:32.269 align:start position:0%
a piece of property that has a mortgage
on

03:15:32.269 --> 03:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:15:36.229 --> 03:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
it um and then they decide to make this
 
03:15:38.269 --> 03:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
property community property by putting
 
03:15:41.070 --> 03:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
it in the trust right technically the
 
03:15:43.870 --> 03:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage is owned by that one person it
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
is owed by that one person right it's
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
let's say the husband bought a a house
 
03:15:51.950 --> 03:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
got a mortgage on it then they got
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
married then they put it into such a
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
trust um now the house would be owned
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
50/50 by these two married people right
 
03:16:03.510 --> 03:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore the husband owes the money
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
but both of them own the property and
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
you got a problem because maybe the
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
collateral on this loan is not big
 
03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
enough anymore right so so there this
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
amendment um takes care of that
 
03:16:17.950 --> 03:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
situation so it would be both people
 
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
would still be responsible for the
 
03:16:22.189 --> 03:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
mortgage or the you know the entire
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
value of the properties uh you know is
 
03:16:26.950 --> 03:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
still on the hook sort of for that
 
03:16:28.630 --> 03:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
mortgage that's that's the point of this
 
03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm totally on board with this
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
this correction I think it that was just
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
a case that we hadn't thought about when
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
we wrote this bill and I'm happy to
 
03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
we wrote this bill and I'm happy to
answer

03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
question questions for this oh yes
 
03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:43.870 align:start position:0%
question questions for this oh yes
representative

03:16:43.870 --> 03:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
Birch thank you Mr chair thank you uh my
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
friend and
 
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative um I want to ask you
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
about the area that you said you weren't
 
03:16:58.910 --> 03:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
paying much attention to and that is the
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh reduction in the state's general and
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
education funds that this bill would
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
um would do um would you have an
 
03:17:15.710 --> 03:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
objection since you say the purpose of
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is not to uh create um a tax
 
03:17:25.150 --> 03:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
shelter system would you have any
 
03:17:28.590 --> 03:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
problem uh an with an amendment that
 
03:17:33.309 --> 03:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
took out number one which first thing
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
says that an otherwise taxable transfer
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
transfer yeah that's something I would
 
03:17:51.389 --> 03:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
have to look into I mean again
 
03:17:51.399 --> 03:17:56.030 align:start position:0%
have to look into I mean again
it's

03:17:56.030 --> 03:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I I think I would need an
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
attorney to tell
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
me in what case that comes up because I
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that if you read the real estate
 
03:18:11.469 --> 03:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
transfer tax stuff it it probably says
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you create a I don't know what's the
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
name of the trust like a like a
 
03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:19.990 align:start position:0%
name of the trust like a like a
um

03:18:19.990 --> 03:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't know give me an example of an
 
03:18:24.349 --> 03:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
estate trust right I mean you you create
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
a trust for the purpose of of estate uh
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
planning um and you transfer property in
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
that trust then I'm I'm I'm assuming
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
that under real estate transfer tax it
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
says we don't you know accept for that
 
03:18:41.189 --> 03:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
kind of transfer right and so this would
 
03:18:43.710 --> 03:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
be the same thing so I I assume that
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
this line is just there because uh
 
03:18:48.510 --> 03:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's another line somewhere else that
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
says I created this other kind of trust
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
and you know you see what I mean so so
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is intended to be like other trusts
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
not that it's trying to be some from the
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire point of view come some
 
03:19:06.830 --> 03:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:08.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of intent or desire and the
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
like if
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
this Bill and I'm talking about the
 
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
section one creating this exemption from
 
03:19:26.309 --> 03:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
paying the real estate property tax can
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
you also do you have information glader
 
03:19:32.990 --> 03:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
on finance about how
 
03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
much this
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
provision would cost your the taxpayers
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire it's it
 
03:19:44.520 --> 03:19:46.910 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire it's it
and

03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
or even a range 100 million 50 million
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea from you what this
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
would actually cost the taxpayers so
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
again I would tend to think that if
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
doing this creates a real estate
 
03:20:03.870 --> 03:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
transfer tax event people wouldn't do it
 
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
right so so in my mind there isn't any
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
cost but but I I can try to I'll find
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
out for you um number one I'll look I'll
 
03:20:14.429 --> 03:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
look at the rest of this
 
03:20:16.950 --> 03:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh I'll look at the rest of
 
03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 78b colon 2 and see if there's other
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions in there for other kinds of
 
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
trusts right because I have a feeling if
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
you looked at it there would probably be
 
03:20:30.429 --> 03:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
you know all these kind of estate trusts
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
are are in there and this would just be
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
yet another one so
 
03:20:41.309 --> 03:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean again it essentially um
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
right now nobody's creating this kind of
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
a trust right and so uh um they're not
 
03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
changing the ownership of their property
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore there's no tax right so so
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't see
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
how uh creating this kind of a trust and
 
03:21:02.670 --> 03:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
and somebody just they still own their
 
03:21:03.670 --> 03:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know they owned their property
 
03:21:05.469 --> 03:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
before they own it now it's just in a
 
03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
different under a different technical
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
title I don't see how that's a taxable
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
event so but I'll I'll find out a little
 
03:21:16.590 --> 03:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
bit more and I'll get back to you on if
 
03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
if any trust type activity creates real
 
03:21:21.150 --> 03:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
estate transfer
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
events how much money is
 
03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
involved thank you representative other
 
03:21:29.229 --> 03:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
other questions for this
 
03:21:32.429 --> 03:21:32.439 align:start position:0%
witness representative Manos thank you
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire for taking my questions um I
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
read line 12 on page
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
two as giving the grantour of the
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
trust the ability to decide on um what
 
03:21:55.389 --> 03:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
the division would be at the dissolution
 
03:21:58.110 --> 03:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
of the marriage and I'm wondering if I'm
 
03:22:25.430 --> 03:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:25.440 --> 03:22:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:37.189 --> 03:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
so um the trust is has to be that each
 
03:22:40.590 --> 03:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
person has a has a one half share in in
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
the community property um while they're
 
03:22:46.030 --> 03:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
alive and I think what this is saying is
 
03:22:48.269 --> 03:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
you can say where it
 
03:22:52.189 --> 03:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
goes um among after
 
03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
um dissolution death Etc but
 
03:23:01.950 --> 03:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
um in general this it's intended that
 
03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
that um all of the property goes to the
 
03:23:07.349 --> 03:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
other spouse right I
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
mean this is I I have a feeling that
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
when it says death here um this is has
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
to do with if death if if both die they
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
could they could um uh you know that's
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
what that's about it's not about one
 
03:23:27.870 --> 03:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
person dies because when one person dies
 
03:23:30.030 --> 03:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
with this kind of a trust the other
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
person inherits that's the whole point
 
03:23:36.630 --> 03:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
of it may I may I have a follow yeah
 
03:23:40.110 --> 03:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
um but one of the reasons that this
 
03:23:42.990 --> 03:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
would come into effect could be divorce
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
is that correct oh yeah
 
03:23:48.630 --> 03:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
well yeah yeah but but
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
um at time of divorce then um the
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
property is still half and half right so
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
um it would be part of their divorce
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
settlement what what happens to the
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
property there's no
 
03:24:07.710 --> 03:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
um there would be no benefit I think to
 
03:24:10.510 --> 03:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
having this as community property in the
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
case of divorce right so it's it's the
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
only benefit to this has to do with
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
what happens when somebody inherits um
 
03:24:23.469 --> 03:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
uh at the you know when when one becomes
 
03:24:27.389 --> 03:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
a widow or widower so so under divorce I
 
03:24:28.830 --> 03:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any difference
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
between this kind of trust and regular
 
03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:34.469 align:start position:0%
between this kind of trust and regular
joint

03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
property follow yeah so in your view the
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Family Division would still have the
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
ability for example in a fault divorce
 
03:24:48.990 --> 03:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or alimony would still
 
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
be able to take the Corpus of the trust
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and say no the wife gets 60% and the
 
03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
husband gets 40% is that your
 
03:25:02.429 --> 03:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah I think you're asking
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
me something beyond my knowledge so I
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
would tend to think yes right but again
 
03:25:10.990 --> 03:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
the same event if if that's what's
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
allowed with a current you know joint
 
03:25:15.309 --> 03:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
checking account or something then I
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
would say yes okay thank you I I lived
 
03:25:20.910 --> 03:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
just just for interest I mean I I lived
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
in a community property state for as an
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
adult for 13 years and and there was
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
nothing odd about our you know all of
 
03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
our accounts were community property but
 
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
there was nothing strange about divorce
 
03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:38.910 align:start position:0%
there was nothing strange about divorce
or

03:25:38.910 --> 03:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
um or other characteristics of those
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
accounts right I mean we both could use
 
03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
them and deal with you know use the
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
money in them and things like that it it
 
03:25:53.030 --> 03:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
was just it it was a feature that made a
 
03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
difference um well it had two two sort
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
of differences one is that uh it was the
 
03:26:02.189 --> 03:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
difference and death that we talk about
 
03:26:04.349 --> 03:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
here and one person inherits all that
 
03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
but but also in a community property
 
03:26:10.110 --> 03:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
State it's impossible to have sort of
 
03:26:13.150 --> 03:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
your own if your own you get income the
 
03:26:16.269 --> 03:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
marriage gets income right there's not a
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's not like I can have my own
 
03:26:20.229 --> 03:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
checking account and my income goes to
 
03:26:22.269 --> 03:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
my account my wife's income goes in her
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
account and they're completely separate
 
03:26:26.670 --> 03:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
we can do that here you cannot do that
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
in a community property state but that
 
03:26:30.070 --> 03:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with this
 
03:26:32.349 --> 03:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
trust because creating this trust
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the basis of our law
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
right so if I may Mr chair one more yeah
 
03:26:43.309 --> 03:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just am concerned that
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
the terms in in New Hampshire If This
 
03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
Were to be law that in New Hampshire the
 
03:26:50.910 --> 03:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the trust would
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
supersede or become relevant in the
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
divorce and the ability of the court to
 
03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
divide the property um and that's that's
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
my concern I understand and and I guess
 
03:27:09.070 --> 03:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to plead ignorance on that
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
one but I'll see if I can find out about
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
that one too right other questions for
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
this represent representative tur yeah
 
03:27:18.349 --> 03:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair and and thanks for
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
taking the question um and I'll preface
 
03:27:26.429 --> 03:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer not a tax person um in the
 
03:27:27.950 --> 03:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
title it says it's establishing
 
03:27:29.710 --> 03:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
community property trusts but I'm having
 
03:27:31.590 --> 03:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
trouble understanding is this a new type
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
of trust or is this a modification to
 
03:27:36.630 --> 03:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
what would otherwise be sort of an
 
03:27:38.349 --> 03:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
existing type of trust in New Hampshire
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
like IR revocable trust Family Trust um
 
03:27:43.389 --> 03:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
and is it an either or situation because
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not really clear like how would it
 
03:27:49.150 --> 03:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
interact so yes it's an either or thing
 
03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's like those other trusts
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
only in the sense that they're trusts
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
right so a trust is kind of a box that
 
03:27:59.550 --> 03:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
you put things in or or a title you give
 
03:28:01.790 --> 03:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
to property right and and it has
 
03:28:03.870 --> 03:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
features and it has an agreement and it
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
has all that stuff but but it is a new
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
kind of trust in the sense that only
 
03:28:14.469 --> 03:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
five other states have this kind and um
 
03:28:16.429 --> 03:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
you know we would be the sixth one
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's all so quick followup sure maybe
 
03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
quick um so if if someone's family had a
 
03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
rable trust in place and wanted to
 
03:28:29.670 --> 03:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
exercise this feature they would
 
03:28:31.150 --> 03:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
basically have to dissolve their
 
03:28:33.550 --> 03:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
existing trust and move to a community
 
03:28:35.950 --> 03:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
property trust that and could you add
 
03:28:38.110 --> 03:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
all the other features of you know
 
03:28:42.750 --> 03:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
irrevocable trust into into this vehicle
 
03:28:43.950 --> 03:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand how
 
03:28:45.630 --> 03:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
disruptive this would be can a trust
 
03:28:48.030 --> 03:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
contain another trust or well that's why
 
03:28:49.870 --> 03:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
I was wondering is it separate or or is
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
it a modification because it seems like
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
if it's a completely either or it's
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're either in revocable say or in a
 
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
Community Trust then it seems like it
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
could cause a lot of disruption in terms
 
03:29:05.950 --> 03:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
of the way people currently have things
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
set up to move to this thank you for the
 
03:29:11.710 --> 03:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
question so um again this is probably
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
beyond my uh my level I think we have an
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
attorney coming who you can answer this
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
question I personally would think that
 
03:29:22.030 --> 03:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
you can't put a trust inside another
 
03:29:25.389 --> 03:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
trust right so so I think you have to
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
put property in trusts and therefore yes
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
you would have to take apart one and to
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
start another yes but again you know
 
03:29:38.110 --> 03:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
even if this is not you know sort of
 
03:29:40.590 --> 03:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
universally applicable for everybody's
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
situation there's still plenty of people
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
who could take advantage of this
 
03:29:47.469 --> 03:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
especially if they're starting fresh
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
right I mean if they're doing their
 
03:29:51.150 --> 03:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
estate planning starting now this would
 
03:29:54.189 --> 03:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
be yet another option to do right
 
03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
so the fact that some people have
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
existing setups that are not applicable
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
to this that's not a particular reason
 
03:30:07.870 --> 03:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
not to do it in my opinion other
 
03:30:11.469 --> 03:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
questions so and maybe I oh I'm sorry
 
03:30:13.189 --> 03:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative B go
 
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair
 
03:30:18.389 --> 03:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
strange questions but I'm going to ask
 
03:30:18.399 --> 03:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
strange questions but I'm going to ask
them

03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:30:23.469 --> 03:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
anyway uh I guess I'm going to ask you
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
based on the research that you've done
 
03:30:28.150 --> 03:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
from the other states can you tell me if
 
03:30:29.790 --> 03:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
there's positive and negatives that came
 
03:30:31.309 --> 03:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
out of that since some people have
 
03:30:33.510 --> 03:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
already had it effectively I won't say
 
03:30:36.309 --> 03:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
effectively but they've obviously
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
already been working with this system do
 
03:30:41.469 --> 03:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
we know any of the highs in lows
 
03:30:45.189 --> 03:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
of yeah I I think it's from what I can
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
tell it's it's quite simple and and it's
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
the advantage is the tax advantage I was
 
03:30:56.189 --> 03:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
talking about and and I haven't read any
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
kind of anything negative I haven't read
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
anybody saying boy I had one of these
 
03:31:03.269 --> 03:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
and it screwed me up in such and such a
 
03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
way or anything like that so so no I
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see any
 
03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
negatives any surveys you've
 
03:31:17.550 --> 03:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
done okay but again I I would say you
 
03:31:19.189 --> 03:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
know this is something that's that's
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
sort of new in the last 10 years right
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
so the number of people who have taken
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of it who have had deaths etc
 
03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
etc is probably not
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
huge in my you know from what I can tell
 
03:31:36.510 --> 03:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
just one followup sir
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
sure now I know that there's uh I've
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
heard of a trend even in my neighborhood
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
where you know a person of color could
 
03:31:46.830 --> 03:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
not buy directly
 
03:31:49.229 --> 03:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
through channels most other people would
 
03:31:50.590 --> 03:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
they have to buy the house directly from
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
the owner so I'm just wondering would
 
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
this affect that at
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
all yeah I I doubt it yeah I mean I I
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't know about that kind of a
 
03:32:02.469 --> 03:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
situation that seems illegal I'm just
 
03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's something that could
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
help them versus you
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
know okay the the situation you're
 
03:32:11.469 --> 03:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
describing I think is illegal right so
 
03:32:11.479 --> 03:32:12.189 align:start position:0%
describing I think is illegal right so
you

03:32:12.189 --> 03:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
know um yeah
 
03:32:18.189 --> 03:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
other but I was curious thank you yeah
 
03:32:18.199 --> 03:32:19.269 align:start position:0%
other but I was curious thank you yeah
other

03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%

considering that
 
03:33:33.550 --> 03:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment and uh questions for these
 
03:33:36.510 --> 03:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
Witnesses so know so can I just make so
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that I'm
 
03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
understanding what this amendment does
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
is it basically says if if you establish
 
03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
a community proper trust and some of the
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
property that you put into that trust is
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
subject to a mortgage the the mortgage
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the uh mortgage e the bank doesn't
 
03:34:01.950 --> 03:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
get hurt doesn't lose some right it
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't lose sort of half the interest
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
in the property or whatever is that that
 
03:34:09.550 --> 03:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
basically correct yes go ahead Rob uh
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct so the concern that came
 
03:34:13.469 --> 03:34:13.479 align:start position:0%
to my mind is if you have a property
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's worth let's say a million dollars
 
03:34:17.870 --> 03:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
and it has an $800,000 mortgage on it
 
03:34:19.469 --> 03:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
and you transferred into one of these
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
trusts and that's the only asset in the
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
trust now under the legislation before
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment was introduced um the bank
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
the Creditor would only be able to try
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
and seek um its security interest up to
 
03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
half of the value of that property and
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
there actually was a spillover issue
 
03:34:36.750 --> 03:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
that the amendment addressed too well
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's not truly within our concern on the
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
bankers Association side we added we
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
suggested language that also addressed
 
03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
lean holders with the thought that this
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
could also impair um Municipal uh real
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
estate property tax leans and making
 
03:34:51.790 --> 03:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
sure that those also weren't going to be
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
impacted so I think this amendment the
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
way we've drafted it also encompasses
 
03:34:58.349 --> 03:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
sort of all creditors and lean holders
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
that might be they're all held harmless
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
they're all they're all their interest
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
is going to not be diluted by going into
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
the trust um the other piece uh is in
 
03:35:09.189 --> 03:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
section c of that area I don't have the
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
line number I apologize um this would be
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
line 11 uh we clarified that obligations
 
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
incurred by both spouses it says during
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
marriage was the original language um we
 
03:35:24.150 --> 03:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
clarified that it's during or before
 
03:35:25.870 --> 03:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
marriage contemplating that there might
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
be scenarios where an unmarried couple
 
03:35:30.189 --> 03:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
has purchased a house together that has
 
03:35:31.870 --> 03:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
a mortgage on it and they've transferred
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
it into the trust and then they've later
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
gotten married and I think the original
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
language had some ambiguity about what
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of that would be as well so
 
03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:40.990 align:start position:0%
the impact of that would be as well so
all

03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:35:45.269 --> 03:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
right um questions for this um either of
 
03:35:47.070 --> 03:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
these WI
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:00.760 align:start position:0%

HB

03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:36:18.189 --> 03:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
88 um you know what can I just um do we
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
still have the uh the two yeah you know
 
03:36:23.309 --> 03:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
can I I'm sorry can I ask you the
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
attorney to come up just for one
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
question I want to make sure I'm
 
03:36:31.469 --> 03:36:31.479 align:start position:0%
understand so I wonder if I could follow
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
up on a question that representative tur
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
asked I think the prior witness
 
03:36:40.189 --> 03:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
if if I'm understanding correctly if
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
somebody has an existing trust an
 
03:36:45.870 --> 03:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
existing let's say revocable trust
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
and this law became effective and they
 
03:36:52.830 --> 03:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
didn't change to make their revocable
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
trust a community property revocable
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
trust the only thing that would happen
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
is they wouldn't get the benefit of this
 
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
but there would am I correct in
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
understanding there would be no there
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
no for lack of a better term affirmative
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
harm to them they just wouldn't get the
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.110 --> 03:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
does the micophone with a large caveat
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
which is I'm not a trust State's
 
03:37:19.229 --> 03:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney and I didn't view the bill with
 
03:37:22.269 --> 03:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
that lens however that being said um
 
03:37:25.389 --> 03:37:25.399 align:start position:0%
looking at it I believe what what a
 
03:37:27.389 --> 03:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
trust and estate's attorney would do is
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to have a trust treated
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
as a community property trust they'd
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
want to do something to specifically
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
invoke that in the trust instrument to
 
03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
say that they're they're lumping it
 
03:37:39.790 --> 03:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
within this RSA as created and I don't
 
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
think there's anything that I observed
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
in reading this that would sort of supon
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
automatically um transform one into a
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
community property trust I think it
 
03:37:49.950 --> 03:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
would have to be a specific election so
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
they might have to perhaps do an like an
 
03:37:53.710 --> 03:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to the trust saying that this
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
the trust that was is established as a
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
community property that that's my
 
03:38:00.030 --> 03:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
reading subject to that caveat okay
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
other questions in light of my question
 
03:38:04.510 --> 03:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%

Eric tur representative tur from

Brentwood um and here to introduce House
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 98 um for those who were here in
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the previous uh session you will
 
03:39:13.469 --> 03:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
recognize this um as being effectively
 
03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
identical to what was house
 
03:39:20.910 --> 03:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
1082 um during during the last session
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
um and I'll explain a little bit about
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
why that is um it is a bill that I
 
03:39:29.469 --> 03:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
brought um in response to a constituent
 
03:39:32.670 --> 03:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
request and and uh Mr gown uh from my
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
town is here um and he will uh speak to
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
that as well um he and his um business
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
attorney basically put this um the idea
 
03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
before me um uh made the mistake last
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
time around of using the word simple
 
03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
when introducing the bill because it
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
seemed simple but we not make that
 
03:39:54.150 --> 03:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
mistake again
 
03:39:54.160 --> 03:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
mistake again
um

03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll explain it in a minute but
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh in in terms of the disposition of
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
last um sessions Bill uh there was there
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about how this
 
03:40:09.630 --> 03:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
impacts different professions and
 
03:40:13.469 --> 03:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
different um professions that use the uh
 
03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
limited uh PLL l c professional limited
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
liability vehicle um for their for their
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
organization um that went to a
 
03:40:27.189 --> 03:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and uh resulted in an
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify some things in the
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill um and then basically passed out of
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
our committee not unanimous there were
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
there were still a couple of of
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
reservations but um it went to the floor
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and passed on a Voice vote from the
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
house um in terms of why it's back again
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
it uh it then went to the other body um
 
03:40:52.750 --> 03:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
and uh at the hearing um uh one of the
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
folks uh that had been on our
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee from this committee um
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
basically had asked that committee to
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
pause their exec for a minute um while
 
03:41:08.349 --> 03:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
the bar association's Ethics Committee
 
03:41:10.189 --> 03:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
was going to meet in a short period of
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
time after that day um and basically
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
what that led to was there was no time
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
left in the session and they had
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
perceived that there was a problem from
 
03:41:21.870 --> 03:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
the bar association I don't want to
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
speak for the bar association but uh no
 
03:41:26.910 --> 03:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
problem was ever brought to my attention
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so it went to interim study for uh
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
the concern that there was something
 
03:41:34.990 --> 03:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
that they had not heard um and so that
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
was the res that was the the termination
 
03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh in the last session and
 
03:41:41.550 --> 03:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's why it's back essentially in its
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
full form um and again if there are
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
issues we glad to deal with them but
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully um they're they're not um so
 
03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
starting off on what this bill is uh
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's modification to 304 D12 which is
 
03:41:58.349 --> 03:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
the area of law that that deals with um
 
03:42:01.389 --> 03:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
this particular type of uh corporate
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
structure called the professional
 
03:42:05.469 --> 03:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
limited liability Corporation or
 
03:42:10.229 --> 03:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
pllc um and what a pllc is my own
 
03:42:12.349 --> 03:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what it is it's really
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
a combination of um a professional
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
services provider organization and a
 
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
corporate structure that has to be run
 
03:42:27.910 --> 03:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
by and solely run by um members of that
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
profession and so um as you as you'll
 
03:42:33.469 --> 03:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
hear it originally came out of a
 
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
Veterinary practice but it touches many
 
03:42:38.710 --> 03:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
other type of um professional
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
organizations that that that have um
 
03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:45.710 align:start position:0%
organizations that that that have um
essentially

03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and so you must
 
03:42:53.469 --> 03:42:53.479 align:start position:0%
be um a member of that profession in
 
03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
good standing basically to be a a a
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
director officer of of the organization
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
and it presents a problem only in the
 
03:43:06.990 --> 03:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
situation of essentially a solo practice
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
PLC um they do exist um so there are
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
still solo practitioners more in some
 
03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
professions than others um and The
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
Dilemma is if the um sole member and and
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
the corporate directors must all be
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
members of the profession uh suddenly
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
becomes unavailable and that can either
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
be because they died or um uh or they
 
03:43:34.110 --> 03:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
lost their standing you know to practice
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
within their profession um then
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
essentially you're left with the
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
situation where yes this organization
 
03:43:43.590 --> 03:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
does not currently have a professional
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
to carry out its duties but it also does
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
not have a director to to dispose of or
 
03:43:52.830 --> 03:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
carry forward the organization if
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
they're more than one member then the
 
03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
remaining you know professional is
 
03:43:59.790 --> 03:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
authorized to continue operating the the
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
corporation uh but if you're the soul
 
03:44:04.830 --> 03:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
member it falls into essentially a gray
 
03:44:08.189 --> 03:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
area um
 
03:44:10.990 --> 03:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
and it's dealt with in different ways by
 
03:44:12.590 --> 03:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
different individuals some people sort
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
of form a handshake agreement with other
 
03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
professionals that are not part of their
 
03:44:20.229 --> 03:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
organization to sort of jump in at the
 
03:44:22.189 --> 03:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
last minute if something goes wrong and
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you know essentially get appointed
 
03:44:26.670 --> 03:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
by the court to take over and dissolve
 
03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
the organization but what it amounts to
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
is it it essentially kills an otherwise
 
03:44:36.750 --> 03:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
viable organization that could be um
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
continued in various ways you know by
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
bringing someone else on another
 
03:44:46.149 --> 03:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
professional um or sold or um
 
03:44:49.469 --> 03:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
you know at at least
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh something other than essentially
 
03:44:53.710 --> 03:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
dissolution with no value because the
 
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
corporation is essentially unable to
 
03:44:58.389 --> 03:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
operate and so this fixes that by
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
allowing um a a unique status which is
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
the uh uh appointment of what's called
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
an assistant manager um that is not a
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
professional is not a member of the
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
association but only in the instance of
 
03:45:16.149 --> 03:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
a solo practice pllc can be
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
um in the position that if that person
 
03:45:20.910 --> 03:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
becomes unqualified or or no longer
 
03:45:23.309 --> 03:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
qualified for whatever reason that
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
person can step in and continue the
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
corporate directing the corporate side
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the pllc so that it can take whatever
 
03:45:32.590 --> 03:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
actions it needs to including even you
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
know paying people and and other other
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
other things that would no longer be
 
03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:38.349 align:start position:0%
other things that would no longer be
possible

03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
so um it allows that person to take that
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
status for uh a maximum of one year so
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't create a continuing uh situation
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the amendment clarified although it
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to be covered by the the term
 
03:45:55.389 --> 03:45:55.399 align:start position:0%
qualified individual but that person
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
cannot carry out any professional duties
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
so if it's a Veterinary practice they
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
can't treat animals if it's a law
 
03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
practice they can't you know advise
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
clients or manage their their funds or
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
anything so you know in order for it to
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
do anything other than essentially
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
dissolve a little more gracefully than
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
it would have other otherwise um they
 
03:46:18.510 --> 03:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
would have to take some action to get
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
services from uh another individual to
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
basically take over that that Institute
 
03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
so that that's the change um that's
 
03:46:31.070 --> 03:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
proposed and um you know the the goal
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
again is is to preserve the value and
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
the utility and the uh of the
 
03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
organization going forward without sort
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
of creating this kind of crisis
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
situation for you know for the the
 
03:46:44.550 --> 03:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
entities running it and with that um
 
03:46:49.870 --> 03:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:52.189 --> 03:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
witness beinging none all right thank
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:47:19.149 --> 03:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to testify
 
03:47:22.269 --> 03:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
today my name is Roger gown my wife Dr
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%

HP 98 addresses a problem with
 
03:47:30.750 --> 03:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
succession planning for small
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
professional practices like my wife's in
 
03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in a single member limited
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
liability company or professional
 
03:47:38.590 --> 03:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
limited liability company that has an
 
03:47:40.990 --> 03:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
owner manager but no assistant manager
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
when the manager dies the executive of
 
03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
the estate must petition the probate
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
court for an order appointing a person
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
to administer the practice winding it up
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
and dissolving it or selling it it can
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
take several months to get such an order
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
from the Probate Court during that time
 
03:47:56.590 --> 03:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
with no one to manage the business it's
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
likely to lose much of its value however
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
if the LC or PC has an assistant manager
 
03:48:04.110 --> 03:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
that person can immediately step in and
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
manage the practice under present law in
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
order to designate someone as the
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
assistant manager of a PLC that person
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
must be licensed in the profession of
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
the plc
 
03:48:16.990 --> 03:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
in our case although I managed the
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
finances of my wife's business for many
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
years I was not eligible to be named
 
03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
assistant manager because I am not a
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarian in the event of her death I
 
03:48:27.309 --> 03:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
would have no authority over her
 
03:48:29.309 --> 03:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
business even as the executive of her
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
estate I could not pay employees or
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
vendors I are a leaf veterinarian to
 
03:48:36.510 --> 03:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
keep the business going convert the
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
business to an LLC or work to wind it up
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
or sell it under present law the
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
licensed professional pllc owner must
 
03:48:44.359 --> 03:48:45.269 align:start position:0%
licensed professional pllc owner must
identify

03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
identify
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
another licensed professional that they
 
03:48:49.389 --> 03:48:49.399 align:start position:0%
have the utmost trust in one who is
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take on such a large
 
03:48:53.950 --> 03:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility simply as a favor this is
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
not an easy task for the owner of a
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
small single member practice and it
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
isn't always
 
03:49:01.389 --> 03:49:01.399 align:start position:0%
possible HB 98 would make it easier for
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
owner managers to designate an assistant
 
03:49:05.550 --> 03:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
manager as that person would not need to
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
be licensed within the profession this
 
03:49:09.469 --> 03:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
person could be the licens professional
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
spouse or other trusted family member of
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
course the nonprofessional assistant
 
03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
manager would have a limited time in
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
which to act would not be permitted to
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
work in the practice in a professional
 
03:49:20.670 --> 03:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
capacity and would have to act in
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
accordance with the plc's operating
 
03:49:25.030 --> 03:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
agreement HP 98 would help ensure that
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
the interests and desires of the owner
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
of a small professional practice would
 
03:49:29.950 --> 03:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
be kept Paramount in the resolution of
 
03:49:31.750 --> 03:49:31.760 align:start position:0%

introduce
 
03:59:57.750 --> 03:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
hb11 which is um it's a it's a very
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
simple bill it simply
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
extends the life of the um right to know
 
04:00:07.710 --> 04:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
on budsman which under current law will
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
expire on June 30th of this year to for
 
04:00:15.149 --> 04:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
another two years um
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh I I did this after speaking with um
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:00:23.229 --> 04:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
budsman um who informed me of that I
 
04:00:24.990 --> 04:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
until he had informed me I frankly
 
04:00:28.590 --> 04:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware that it that the uh statute
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
had a uh that the the establishment of
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
the um budsman had a a cut off period um
 
04:00:37.950 --> 04:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
I should say that um just being
 
04:00:40.750 --> 04:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
completely candid when I introduced the
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill I thought this you know this
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
nothing there's nothing controversial
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
about this whatsoever we're going to
 
04:00:48.910 --> 04:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
extend the the the Ombudsman was
 
04:00:52.469 --> 04:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
established uh couple of years ago uh
 
04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe three years ago now maybe
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
more but certainly very recently and it
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
just seemed to me that um it made it
 
04:01:02.830 --> 04:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
made sense uh to give it at least two
 
04:01:04.590 --> 04:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
more years to uh to see how it was
 
04:01:07.710 --> 04:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
working out since that time I have been
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
told that some people have different
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
views about
 
04:01:16.229 --> 04:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
the uh about whether having the the um
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
budsman is a good idea or not and I have
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
to say honestly that I that is something
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
that um I guess I would want to and I
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
hope that you will want to hear more
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
information on the on that issue because
 
04:01:34.149 --> 04:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
I had not um as I said I sort of thought
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
that this was just completely not
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
non-controversial we were extending it
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
for two years and that was kind of the
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
end of it but if there are uh concerns
 
04:01:45.269 --> 04:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
then you know I want to hear them just
 
04:01:47.149 --> 04:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
as much as I think you would want to
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
hear them um and I guess I the other
 
04:01:51.950 --> 04:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is this is something
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
is candidly um I have not discussed this
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
issue with the leadership of my party
 
04:01:59.229 --> 04:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether those of you on
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
the other side have discuss the issue
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
with the leadership of your party as to
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
knowing what you know what leadership on
 
04:02:06.750 --> 04:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
either side thinks about about this and
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
that again would obviously that would
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
make a difference to me and I assume it
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
would uh it would make a difference to
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
the people on the on the other side so
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's kind of I introduced the bill and
 
04:02:22.590 --> 04:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
um uh I think we I hope I hope you will
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh listen to the other witnesses that
 
04:02:27.910 --> 04:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
are here um and you know we'll have a
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
chance to get some further input um all
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
around before we um exec this bill which
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
certainly which will not be today and
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
other than that I'm happy to answer
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I received as I think all of us did a
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful careful letter um
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
expressing concern and I read
 
04:03:04.030 --> 04:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
it and um it was from someone in from
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
Rochester in straford County where I
 
04:03:10.110 --> 04:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
live and there was nothing in that
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
letter that was critical in any way
 
04:03:17.389 --> 04:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
of the Ombudsman or the office of the
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman it was critical of the way a
 
04:03:24.149 --> 04:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
particular City in this case
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
Rochester um had behaved and
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
um is that the kind of complaint that
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
you are referring to no no I you're
 
04:03:39.229 --> 04:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
right I did see that letter and I agree
 
04:03:41.309 --> 04:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
with you completely that was not in any
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
way being critical of the udman it was
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.149 --> 04:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
way particular people in Rochester had
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
had uh handle that so no that that was
 
04:03:56.189 --> 04:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
not it but I have
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
heard uh some
 
04:04:02.149 --> 04:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
grumblings from uh people including
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
including other reps um about uh you
 
04:04:09.870 --> 04:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
know whether it's really worth having um
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
the um the udman or whether it would be
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
better to just not continue that and you
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
know go back to the old process of going
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court the only thing I would
 
04:04:20.110 --> 04:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
say there is I think it's important to
 
04:04:21.309 --> 04:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
keep this in
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
mind if it turned out to be the
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the legislature that we
 
04:04:31.229 --> 04:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
should not continue the um budsman um
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
bear in mind we would have to make some
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
changes uh to some other
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
laws uh or at least other aspects of the
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
right to no law including for example
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
one that we just passed last year which
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
says that um you know we we we allowed
 
04:04:49.149 --> 04:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
costs to be
 
04:04:52.510 --> 04:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
obtained uh by municipalities for if if
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
there was an excessive number of email
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
requests and there's a provision in that
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
requires uh that that uh provides for
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman to
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
review uh certain certain aspects of
 
04:05:09.790 --> 04:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
that so if we were to eliminate the um
 
04:05:11.309 --> 04:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
budsman I think we would at the very
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
least have to make some changes to
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
um to that statute to say you know that
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
function would be performed Again by I
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
guess by the Superior Court um so any
 
04:05:26.110 --> 04:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm just saying that you know
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
there may
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
be just eliminating the udman if that
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
was the anybody's intent might not be
 
04:05:35.950 --> 04:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
quite that simple and I'm not again I'm
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that we should or should
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
not I'm I'm sort of open to to hearing
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this could I ask
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
one followup yes follow up thank you
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I believe that the work of
 
04:05:54.000 --> 04:05:55.710 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I believe that the work of
the

04:05:55.710 --> 04:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislature is done in committee that's
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
why I think it's incredibly important
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
that every member of the legislature
 
04:06:06.550 --> 04:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
serve on a committee because we all know
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's where the hard the heavy lifting
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
takes place so I would like to just ask
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
you so do you really
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
believe that a committee should
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
begin by listening to a directive from
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
leadership from people who aren't on the
 
04:06:30.910 --> 04:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee that's doing the heavy lifting
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
no I guess what I was saying when you
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
say listen to I mean if
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
the I would want if leadership on either
 
04:06:40.830 --> 04:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
side I mean my party from my side and
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
your party from your side said you know
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have a view knew that it's important
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
to keep the the ombudsman's office in
 
04:06:50.149 --> 04:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
place on the one hand or it's important
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
to get rid of it on the other hand I
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
mean that would have significant impact
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
on me I guess I would want to you know I
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
would certainly be asking the question
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
why do you have the view you have but it
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be
 
04:07:05.469 --> 04:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
important to me in my in my thinking on
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
the matter thank you very
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
much there any any other questions of
 
04:07:10.720 --> 04:07:12.510 align:start position:0%
much there any any other questions of
this

04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
Witness representative
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
andas thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
04:07:20.429 --> 04:07:20.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Mr chair is
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
there data
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
available as to how many cases have
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
actually gone in how many has been
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
settled and what the total cost it is to
 
04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
run that office I believe that that
 
04:07:40.269 --> 04:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
information is available and that I uh
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
it may be that one of the witnesses
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
who's going to testify after after me
 
04:07:47.950 --> 04:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
has that information I will say that um
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
I have met in the I well I think it was
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
in during the summer that I met with the
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
um budsman and he had you know a pretty
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
good list of how many cases he had had
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
heard uh that kind of thing he had a
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
pretty good bit of of of information and
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
I assume he's you know he still has that
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
and it's probably updated so I think I
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
think the short answer to your question
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
is yes that information is available
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:17.389 --> 04:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
representative TR yeah thanks um and
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um and it maybe
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
sort of Builds on the last two things
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and even your opening statement I'm
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
curious about the the logic of just
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
extending it for two years um versus
 
04:08:30.990 --> 04:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
removing the sunset provision you know
 
04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
and saying if if at some point down the
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
line we think this is not worth it or
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
whatever that we would would act to um
 
04:08:40.510 --> 04:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
to terminate the UN budsman
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
affirmatively um and and it sort of ties
 
04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
to the question of what the metrics are
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we're that we or the legislature as
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
a whole are going to look to to see
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is or isn't in in a
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
couple of years functional and I think
 
04:08:56.910 --> 04:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that that um representative
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
Andress mentioned are a couple that I I
 
04:09:00.510 --> 04:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
think probably fit in there but I didn't
 
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
know if there was any thinking about why
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
why an extension is is still sort of on
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
a trial basis when it's kind of tied
 
04:09:09.109 --> 04:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
into a number of other functions that
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
seem to fit well there yeah no thank you
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
for the question I um I think I mean you
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
you rais a good point I think you know
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
my my thinking in uh in putting it in to
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
extend it for another two years was that
 
04:09:24.000 --> 04:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
extend it for another two years was that
it

04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
was relatively
 
04:09:30.269 --> 04:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
new um and you know we didn't have a lot
 
04:09:33.790 --> 04:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
of information about how it uh was was
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
working um that my you know I met when I
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
met with the uh with uh the EMB budsman
 
04:09:43.990 --> 04:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
I was you know I I thought he made a
 
04:09:46.510 --> 04:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
very good presentation I thought you
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
know it seemed to me that he um he was
 
04:09:51.630 --> 04:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
doing his job as he thought he should be
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
doing it um but I also my basic reason
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
for not sort of saying let's make it
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
permanent was it was new and I just
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
thought it made more sense to you know
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
extend it for a set period of time and
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
then maybe after that period of time if
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
you know it would make sense to make it
 
04:10:09.790 --> 04:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
permanent but I I but I hear what you're
 
04:10:11.109 --> 04:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
saying and you you you know that you
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
raise a a valid point
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bergeron
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair so how's it going
 
04:10:27.070 --> 04:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
at this point with the Ombudsman is
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
would this be more overwhelming would
 
04:10:31.950 --> 04:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
this be do we hire more
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
or how's the office working well I what
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
I what I would say is and I think you
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
you want to hear from the udman you know
 
04:10:41.229 --> 04:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
who will give you more detailed
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
information but that's a good point but
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is that the udman
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
has been very busy and has worked you
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
know and has and I think has had a lot
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
to do uh over the time that he's been
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
the utsman one of the things that I that
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand and
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think he'll tell you this is the
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
office of the right to know amb budsman
 
04:11:08.950 --> 04:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
is him that's it so when I met with him
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
his office was in the basement of the uh
 
04:11:12.600 --> 04:11:13.790 align:start position:0%
his office was in the basement of the uh
uh

04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh State House Annex Building um not not
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
what we would call Lush Quarters at all
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
and literally I mean he he does all the
 
04:11:27.790 --> 04:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
work when stuff has to go out he mails
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
it out or emails it out or does all that
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
stuff it's not like you know my my
 
04:11:33.189 --> 04:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
assistant is going to handle this or
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
handle that um there is no assistant he
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
does it all um and so you know one of
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
the things that I think we have to think
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
about is
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
it may it may as a practical
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
matter uh if if this position is going
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
to be ex if the position is going to go
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
on it may be that there needs to be
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
additional resources and the fact that
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
there needs to be additional resources
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
may be may be something that goes into
 
04:12:07.469 --> 04:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
the question of whether it's
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
worth extending the office because you
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
know it's it in some sense this is an
 
04:12:16.670 --> 04:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
alternative to the superior
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
court is it a better alternative is it
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
not I I think we you know it's something
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
we ought to we ought to think think
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
about and I don't have a really a
 
04:12:30.670 --> 04:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
that representative strip uh thank you I
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh it seems that you you've uh you've
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
imped that uh uh the edsman is going to
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
testify will he will someone from his
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
office be here today I believe I believe
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
I believe he is seem seems like he could
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of the
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions yes and I'm sure he will I
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
mean he's be when I met with him he was
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
very diligent in providing information I
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
that any other questions oh staying none
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I have one more I'm sorry
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bron I just wanted to
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
know that if we didn't do this and then
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
we had more people going in the court
 
04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
system which one do you which one would
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
you prefer for our
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
constituents I know how to answer well I
 
04:13:30.189 --> 04:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
mean the court system if if a case goes
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
to court then the court system has more
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
reason you know there's not the judges
 
04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
have staff and you know that that kind
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
of so the court system has more
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
resources on the other hand I think it
 
04:13:42.760 --> 04:13:44.070 align:start position:0%
resources on the other hand I think it
is

04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:13:47.149 --> 04:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
it is certainly true that if we didn't
 
04:13:49.830 --> 04:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
have the udman all of the cases that are
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
now being handled by the udman would go
 
04:13:53.070 --> 04:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
to the court and so the court would have
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
more you know would have more to do so
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh I think that there's
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
no to me the udman certainly does defer
 
04:14:05.710 --> 04:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
some cases that would otherwise go to
 
04:14:07.229 --> 04:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
court even though it's true that there
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
can still be an appeal from the udman to
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
court um so and it's just him right now
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
just literally just him and unless
 
04:14:19.149 --> 04:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
unless uh he's gotten better offices
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
since I talk with him he's in the
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
basement of the state housee Annex just
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
one more followup sir last one just I'll
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
just I'll just hurry so at this point do
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
you think that this General I guess I
 
04:14:31.830 --> 04:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
could just ask him if he would benefit
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
from an additional person whether it' be
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
an assistant you could do
 
04:14:39.149 --> 04:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
that you can well I mean if we're not
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
doing one should we make the other one
 
04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know if there's even any areas of
 
04:14:47.550 --> 04:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
inefficiency or maybe not but you
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
probably want help but thank you sir so
 
04:14:52.670 --> 04:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
I just just as an side I think I
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned when I met with the udman that
 
04:14:57.229 --> 04:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
I he's in the basement and I believe I'm
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
not sure about that I don't think
 
04:14:59.790 --> 04:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
there's any windows but I think because
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
I think I remember saying to him you
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
know when I was when I first started out
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
as a judge they had me in the basement
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the Superior Court in Manchester and
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
there were no windows in the basement so
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
I got a picture that I hung on the wall
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
of a of a window
 
04:15:14.910 --> 04:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
and that was my window and I was
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe i' give it to him for uh
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
for his
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
office all right thank you any other
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
kab would you think that it would be C
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
if the if say we weren't to pass this
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
bill would you think that it would be
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive for some
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
to enforce right to no type cases if if
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
we weren't to pass this because the
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
filing fee if if I remember correctly
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
is$ 28 in Superior Court versus it's
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
only $25 with the EMB budsman do you do
 
04:15:48.750 --> 04:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
you perceive that to be a potential
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
issue for for parties that maybe you
 
04:15:53.469 --> 04:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
might not be able to afford that fee oh
 
04:15:55.389 --> 04:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
yeah no I mean there there I think
 
04:15:56.910 --> 04:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's no question that that's true
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
there I there are Provisions generally
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the suprior court rules you know to
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
wave the fees uh this discretion to wave
 
04:16:07.109 --> 04:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
the KE the fees in certain in certain
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
cases if a person can't afford uh and I
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
think I assume that those would apply to
 
04:16:14.429 --> 04:16:14.439 align:start position:0%
these kind of cases is um but but you're
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
right I mean as a general proposition it
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
court now are there any more questions
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
that's it okay kidding thank you thank
 
04:16:29.950 --> 04:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
you is it Thomas Kerr okay I'll ask can
 
04:16:57.370 --> 04:16:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.380 --> 04:16:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me today my name is
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas K KR it's pronounced K but I go
 
04:17:09.070 --> 04:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
by a lot of things um I'm happy to
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
answer some of your questions but I can
 
04:17:12.429 --> 04:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
give you a little overview of my office
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
which I think is probably helpful to
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
know what's going on so I've got a
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
little bit information for you and see
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
what we can do so the officer of right
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
to know Ombudsman that's commonly known
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
as the RKO because right to know
 
04:17:27.630 --> 04:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman is hard to say uh is an
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
independent executive branch state
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
agency and it was created by laws
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
2022 chapter 250 uh even though it was
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
created in uh 2022 it was first staffed
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
by me on January 27 2023 and it remains
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
staffed by me
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
today uh it's established with goals
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
that sometimes can be a little bit
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
competing providing the public with a
 
04:17:54.109 --> 04:17:54.119 align:start position:0%
simpler less expensive and faster
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
alternative to the superior court and
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
resolving complaints under RSA 91a the
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
right to no law uh that's the sum and
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
substance of what I can do I can address
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
other matters just RSA 91a and I look at
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
everything for the lens of RSA 91a that
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
it's different than a court I mean
 
04:18:13.870 --> 04:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes people have disputes that
 
04:18:16.830 --> 04:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
involve a 91a dispute and I have to say
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't do that I'm not a
 
04:18:20.910 --> 04:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
court I can only address the 91a
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
issues uh I began taking inquiries
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
receiving cases almost immediately
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
meaning that I had to perform the
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
functions of the agency even when I was
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
establishing the agency and its
 
04:18:30.760 --> 04:18:32.710 align:start position:0%
establishing the agency and its
procedures

04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's currently set by law to expire J
 
04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
July 1st 20125 at which time my current
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
term of office will also expire unless
 
04:18:41.670 --> 04:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's renewed by the governor executive
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
councel uh not surprisingly I support
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh 111 broadly I believe that
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
it generally takes more than two years
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
for an agency to create itself and then
 
04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's been successful
 
04:18:52.760 --> 04:18:53.910 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's been successful
oneman

04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
oneman
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
operation um again I'm
 
04:18:58.239 --> 04:19:00.149 align:start position:0%
operation um again I'm
my

04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
my scope of functions is limited to RSA
 
04:19:05.950 --> 04:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
91a and I have to on many occasions I
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
have to explain that to people what that
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
means uh spend a lot of time explaining
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
things uh I hear here cases involving
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
all levels of state and local government
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
that includes agencies of the state
 
04:19:20.189 --> 04:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
itself cities towns counties school
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
districts other entities as of today my
 
04:19:25.870 --> 04:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
office has received now I'm going to
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
have to use a word that I use inquiries
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
I have received
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
277 inquiries that is people contacting
 
04:19:37.070 --> 04:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
me about all kinds of things of the 277
 
04:19:40.389 --> 04:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
inquiries that I've received 77 to date
 
04:19:43.389 --> 04:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
have became actual filed cases
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
43 of the inquiries became right to no
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
request to me um and or the substantial
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
equivalent and currently I've closed 47
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
matters and I have 29 matters open
 
04:19:59.229 --> 04:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of difference in
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
those numbers because some of my cases
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
been Consolidated there are procedural
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
things that kind of change the two
 
04:20:07.710 --> 04:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
numbers I gave you but 77 cases to date
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
filed 47 open and uh 29 I'm sorry 47
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
close 29 open uh during the duration of
 
04:20:19.149 --> 04:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
the office uh the time of filing the
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
final disposition varies greatly that
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
depends on the issues that are involved
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the case procedural matters like
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
someone wants an in camera review which
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
is me actually looking at a document
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
which might have been withheld or
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
redacted in order to determine whether
 
04:20:34.510 --> 04:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
it should have been delivered uh what
 
04:20:36.510 --> 04:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
types of motions the parties file
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
including requests for continuance
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
rescheduling proceedings which happens
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
quite often and to great extent uh the
 
04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
duration of a case depends on the
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
willingness of the parties to engage in
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
the processes that I've
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
established you I have uh my oldest case
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
is from back in October of 2023 as a
 
04:20:59.550 --> 04:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
parties that case are aware that matter
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
involved a plethora of procedural
 
04:21:04.630 --> 04:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
matters and for my planning purposes I
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
maintain a narrative docket of each
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
cas's history and so that I can keep
 
04:21:11.149 --> 04:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
track of what's going on occasionally I
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
make that available to the public in
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
general after I've made sure I no
 
04:21:15.760 --> 04:21:16.910 align:start position:0%
general after I've made sure I no
spelling

04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
spelling
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
errors uh the shortest period from
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
filing the conclusion on the case was an
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
expedited proceeding that that was uh
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
eight days from filing to done uh my
 
04:21:29.189 --> 04:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
first case as I said was received almost
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
immediately after I took the OA office
 
04:21:34.229 --> 04:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
my newest case was filed about a week
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
ago uh the number of cases I get a
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
fluctuated between 0 and 8 a month U of
 
04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
which all of them require some immediate
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned by me and yes I am the only
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
person my office is administratively
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of State for
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes only what that
 
04:21:53.309 --> 04:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
means is that my payroll has run through
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
them uh I have some assistance in
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
actually posting things on my website I
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually do the content but the physical
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
posting is done by someone over there
 
04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:05.119 align:start position:0%
other than that uh from beginning to end
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's me first thing I need to do in a
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
case is within 3 days I need to let the
 
04:22:13.149 --> 04:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
respondent know that there's been a
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
claim against them so I do the photocopy
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
and send that out they have 20 days to
 
04:22:19.269 --> 04:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
respond to that and between the 21st and
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
the 60th day I either can grant deny or
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
under RSA 541 a29 schedule an
 
04:22:28.830 --> 04:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceeding or and the preher
 
04:22:30.990 --> 04:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
conference almost all my cases have a
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
prehearing conference and then the
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceeding or at least a
 
04:22:36.510 --> 04:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
prehearing conference which is held and
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
conquered uh and then perhaps we can
 
04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
resolve things on motions or perhaps
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
need an adjudicate
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh I try to encourage at
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
prehearing conferences I try to
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
encourage the parties to talk with each
 
04:22:54.670 --> 04:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
other uh I believe that that's sometimes
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
more effective in person and I encourage
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
them to speak with each other and see if
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
the matter could be informally resolved
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
between the parties without a full
 
04:23:04.750 --> 04:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hearing in part I do that because RSA
 
04:23:04.760 --> 04:23:05.910 align:start position:0%
Hearing in part I do that because RSA
541

04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
541
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
838 provides that as a matter of State
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
policy uh except to the extent precluded
 
04:23:13.229 --> 04:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
by law informal settlement of Matters by
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
nonadjudicated processes is encouraged
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
and I do the try to do that
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
encouragement at a prehearing
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
conference uh again uh my hearings are
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
routinely held in conquered where my
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
office is located although the my next
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
hearing is on Friday and that's in the
 
04:23:30.670 --> 04:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
town of Grafton uh standard case I would
 
04:23:33.229 --> 04:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
say generally takes uh few months from
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
beginning to end given some of the time
 
04:23:36.750 --> 04:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
frames that are built into the statute
 
04:23:40.590 --> 04:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
done at times
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
just the filing of a case motivates
 
04:23:49.990 --> 04:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
parties to have a conversation and leads
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
to a speedy resolution between them by
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
having a talk about what's going on and
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
I times I think that the existence the
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
office itself sometime itself sometimes
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
results in uh willingness of parties to
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
discuss and POS potentially resolve
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
matters without the my actual
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
intervention so since I and since I deal
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
with contested cases which by definition
 
04:24:16.109 --> 04:24:16.119 align:start position:0%
involve two sides and I'm and on which I
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately have to be the decision maker
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
I suspect at least 50% of those who deal
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
with my office will be dissatisfied with
 
04:24:26.670 --> 04:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
the result um I'm lucky if I you know so
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
I do my best uh apart from handling
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
cases inquiries during the first period
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
of my operation I had to establish an
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
update of web presence uh there's a web
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
page now there more information about my
 
04:24:40.269 --> 04:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
office there you can find that through
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's website
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
although is clearly identified as mine
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
not the Secretary of States uh
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
established I had to establish
 
04:24:50.429 --> 04:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
operational rules through the process of
 
04:24:53.189 --> 04:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a if some of you are familiar
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
with RSA 541a that is not a quick
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
process I had a number of uh voluntary
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
public hearings at which a fair number
 
04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
of people showed up um so I adopted my
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules those were based
 
04:25:11.469 --> 04:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
upon the model rules for adjudicated
 
04:25:13.510 --> 04:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
procedure established by Department of
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
Justice uh they were reviewed by the
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
office of legislative Services rules
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
unit they were finalized by my agency
 
04:25:21.870 --> 04:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
after a lot of public comment hearings
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
they were approved without objection by
 
04:25:24.510 --> 04:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative committee on
 
04:25:25.950 --> 04:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and they became
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
effective on May 20th 2024 so now my
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
rules are in effect since I'm a one man
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
outfit that uh faces potential
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
dissolution on July 1st or June 30th the
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
the rules unfortunately contain a
 
04:25:41.309 --> 04:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
provision which I think is probably
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
unique the rules actually say and this
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
is in RKO 21802 and
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
03 that says what happens to my cases if
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
I die become incapacitated or if my
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
agency isn't around anymore so I wrote a
 
04:25:58.990 --> 04:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
rule about my own
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
demise uh the rules also highlight uh
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the ethical obligations that I'm subject
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
to I'm subject to a lot of different
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
ethical obligations being a state
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
employee being an attorney been an
 
04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
attorney now for since 1986 over long
 
04:26:15.309 --> 04:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
that is what's it 30 38 years uh the
 
04:26:17.109 --> 04:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
existence of a provision about what
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
happen should I die highlights the
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
difficulty with having one man operation
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh as does the fact that I'm required by
 
04:26:25.389 --> 04:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
ethical rules to recuse myself from a
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
case if I believe that that's in order I
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
had to do that on one occasion I had to
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
recuse myself because it did not feel as
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
though I should be sitting on it under
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
the standards and guidelines that are
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
applicable to me where does that leave
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
someone well it doesn't leave with the
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
offic the right to know on buman because
 
04:26:45.990 --> 04:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
I can't sit on the case that kind of
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
highlights the difficulty with oneman
 
04:26:51.870 --> 04:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
operation apart from all the stuff uh my
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
first annual report is due on February
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
15th it's due to this committee so I'll
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
be doing a annual report to you folks on
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh honor before the 15th I'm doing my
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
best to get it done ahead of time uh
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
that report goes to this committee
 
04:27:08.439 --> 04:27:09.630 align:start position:0%
that report goes to this committee

Court uh my workload that's entirely
 
04:27:20.590 --> 04:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
dependent on whether a member of the
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%

04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
local County government that they can't
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
informally resolve and if they elect to
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
bring that matter to
 
04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
me uh that's a general overview of my
 
04:27:35.109 --> 04:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
office and yes I I am in the basement on
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
well I I'm told to call at the ground
 
04:27:40.830 --> 04:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
floor uh it's I'm in the basement and I
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
I have half a window I have a window
 
04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
that you can see the bottom part of cars
 
04:27:44.840 --> 04:27:46.469 align:start position:0%
that you can see the bottom part of cars
from

04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh you're welcome to come by it's
 
04:27:50.830 --> 04:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
room 12 down the bottom of State House
 
04:27:54.269 --> 04:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
Annex uh I get plenty of
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
Walkins so that's a little overview of
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
my office and what can I answer for you
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
04:28:01.000 --> 04:28:07.630 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
representative

04:28:07.630 --> 04:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
Horgan um we got a letter from the uh
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee got a letter
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
from a citizen and um not to get too
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
much in the specifics of that case but
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
and that person I think may be
 
04:28:21.630 --> 04:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
testifying soon but like they talked
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
about uh person talked about that they
 
04:28:27.389 --> 04:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
uh sought assistance from a friend and
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
you you gave permission that friend
 
04:28:32.349 --> 04:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
apparently was not you representan I'm
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
not sure I think you want to be careful
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
about asking him about specific case
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay but who who are you who are you
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to like have uh what the rules
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
like who who you're allowed to have
 
04:28:46.269 --> 04:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
represent you represent you if you don't
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
feel confident uh pursuing the whole
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
thing by yourself and there's no
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirement in my office that anyone be
 
04:28:54.349 --> 04:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
represented by an attorney that goes for
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
the town and that goes for other people
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
um I have in the in my administrative
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
rules I came up in rul making about
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
whether there should be some type of
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
limits on who can come in and who can't
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
come in that's been reserved uh there's
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
actually a sectionary rule that says
 
04:29:13.109 --> 04:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
reserved of common representation
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
and that's in case it wants to come up
 
04:29:17.070 --> 04:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
again I frankly have
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
not I have not seen the need to to do
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
that and and I also want to point out
 
04:29:27.149 --> 04:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
that prohibiting representation by
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
anyone other than an attorney works for
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
both sides I have a good number of cases
 
04:29:35.229 --> 04:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
where a municipality
 
04:29:37.870 --> 04:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
is represented
 
04:29:41.309 --> 04:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
by their Town Administrator or someone
 
04:29:43.630 --> 04:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
else who's not the the attorney and
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to the people as far as
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned as to who they want to
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
have be the
 
04:29:50.510 --> 04:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative and if they adhere to the
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
rules they adhere to the
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
kab thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question attorney Kerr would
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
you feel like since this is more
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
intended to be like a a citizen to
 
04:30:12.750 --> 04:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
Citizen type of a resolution process
 
04:30:16.870 --> 04:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
that perhaps it would be appropriate
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
if there was a like kind of a two-prong
 
04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
piece where one if there was no
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
compensation um exchange for a friend
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
helping somebody out with with a with a
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
case like this there was no no
 
04:30:30.040 --> 04:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
case like this there was no no
exchanging

04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
exchanging
 
04:30:35.070 --> 04:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
of compensation of any kind that they be
 
04:30:37.149 --> 04:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
exempt from potentially be considering
 
04:30:41.070 --> 04:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
unauthorized practice of Law and then B
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
um if
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
the um if um the udman office although
 
04:30:47.840 --> 04:30:49.349 align:start position:0%
the um if um the udman office although
they're

04:30:49.349 --> 04:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
all all remedies available under RSA 91
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
A8 are available to the embud zman if
 
04:30:57.389 --> 04:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
one piece of that was Exempted and that
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
piece would be um from awarding the
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of attorney fees
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason I asked that is because
 
04:31:06.640 --> 04:31:07.429 align:start position:0%
and the reason I asked that is because
it

04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:31:10.469 --> 04:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
seems as though and this is in more than
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
one case but it's kind of like a
 
04:31:15.030 --> 04:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
retaliatory automatic filing where you
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
know the if there is an attorney
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
involved that attorney is claiming hey
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
if if you lose I'm going to have make
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
you have to pay the attorney fees so
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's kind of discouraging the citizen
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
from using the process what would you
 
04:31:30.790 --> 04:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
think about that I haven't given a lot
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
of thought to that uh I've had I've had
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
cases where both sides have requested
 
04:31:38.109 --> 04:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
sanctions sanctions sorry remedies under
 
04:31:38.119 --> 04:31:39.510 align:start position:0%
sanctions sanctions sorry remedies under
RSA

04:31:39.510 --> 04:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
918 um and
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and if someone doesn't have an
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
attorney then attorney's fees aren't
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
available um I don't think I can say
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
anything more than that at this
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
point I mean I and in regard to mention
 
04:31:59.590 --> 04:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
of unauthorized practice of law I have
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
no that's not my jurisdiction my
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is to say who can represent
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
people in front of
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
me other questions for this witness
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
is am I correct in saying that there is
 
04:32:17.640 --> 04:32:19.030 align:start position:0%
is am I correct in saying that there is
no

04:32:19.030 --> 04:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
requirement that either party be
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
represented by an
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
attorney and having someone there as a
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
friend of
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
either side does not mean in any way
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
that they are putting themselves forward
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
as an attorney
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to make
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
because that kind of depends on the
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
facts of particular cases but I I I
 
04:32:59.309 --> 04:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
can't answer that that's not my my
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I all I can do is say I
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
have no prohibition on a person
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
representing another person if they are
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
not an attorney thank you other
 
04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
questions for this representative
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
Kat thank you thank you for letting me
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
ask a question uh chairman lenon thank
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
you for taking uh one more question you
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the prehearing conference
 
04:33:25.310 --> 04:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
which is informal and I guess just from
 
04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
a procedural standpoint I was curious
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
I've noticed that in other states
 
04:33:32.310 --> 04:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the udman after just getting
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
the filing and getting you know
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
um an answer back from the respondent
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're able to quickly just say oh this
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
is really cut and dry you just you have
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
to give these records um and often times
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
that that'll just be you know an order
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's emailed 3 days later and the
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
parties don't even have to
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
appear is that something potentially
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
that your office would be able to do so
 
04:33:56.670 --> 04:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
that that way everybody that comes out
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to take a day out of work
 
04:34:00.189 --> 04:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
to come in for a hearing or no that
 
04:34:03.551 --> 04:34:03.561 align:start position:0%
happens in some cases I mean some cases
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
there is no prehearing conference
 
04:34:06.510 --> 04:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
because the matters resolved prior to
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
the prehearing conference frequently
 
04:34:10.109 --> 04:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
it's resolved by informal agreement
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes I've resolved cases on police
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
meetings they just say a motion to
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
dismiss for example no
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
reason ask for the case to be dismissed
 
04:34:19.789 --> 04:34:19.799 align:start position:0%
if there's a reason to dismiss it it's
 
04:34:22.269 --> 04:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
dismissed there's no preeran conference
 
04:34:25.230 --> 04:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh or some can ask for a ruling in their
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
favor essentially a motion for summary
 
04:34:30.429 --> 04:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
judgment there's no need to have a
 
04:34:32.910 --> 04:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing conference I've had for exam
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
an expedited proceedings I know when
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
expedited proceedings I know because
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
some of those involve things like what I
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
I don't only do can you get records They
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
also do was that a proper meeting was
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the notice of the meeting proper um
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes those have to would have to be
 
04:34:51.070 --> 04:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
done a little bit more quickly because
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
that usually comes up right before a
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
meeting uh but not all my cases end up
 
04:34:59.470 --> 04:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
with a prehearing conference they can
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the majority have but not all thank
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
you other questions for yes
 
04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative trip thank you chair
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:35:15.150 --> 04:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
question it it appears to me that uh uh
 
04:35:18.990 --> 04:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
for us to judge whether to
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
extend the ulman's office by two years
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh using you know uh performance
 
04:35:32.429 --> 04:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
criteria is is kind of uh useless since
 
04:35:35.310 --> 04:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
you've only recently actually finally
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
got your office set up to where you're
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh you have a website and and you have
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
rules you know uh do you think
 
04:35:49.470 --> 04:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
that those two conditions will improve
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
the uh performance of your web of your
 
04:35:51.561 --> 04:35:57.150 align:start position:0%
the uh performance of your web of your
uh

04:35:57.150 --> 04:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.789 --> 04:35:59.799 align:start position:0%
office I'm torn on how to answer that
 
04:36:01.551 --> 04:36:01.561 align:start position:0%
because I think I'm doing just about as
 
04:36:04.510 --> 04:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
well as I can under the circumstances
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
however it is clearer to people now than
 
04:36:11.910 --> 04:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
it was when I started what I'm doing
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
originally I had to explain everything
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
about here's what's going to happen
 
04:36:17.470 --> 04:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
here's what you're doing I still do that
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
to some extent but now I can say take a
 
04:36:21.390 --> 04:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
look at the rules take a look at my
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
website and so forth so I think it's it
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
makes it much easier for participants in
 
04:36:29.949 --> 04:36:29.959 align:start position:0%
the process I do things basically the
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
same way my rules were based upon
 
04:36:36.510 --> 04:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
Justice 800 which basically sets up how
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
you do things and the things that were
 
04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
open I Tred to explain in letters I
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
still try to do that individually each
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
case that comes in I first of all I
 
04:36:53.230 --> 04:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
photocopy the complaint I find the I
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually locate which people in the
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
municipality are the ones that are
 
04:36:58.590 --> 04:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be notified under my rules
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
because those are specific people you
 
04:37:01.470 --> 04:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
can't just send it to anybody in the
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
town it's usually two or three people uh
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then I do a cover letter that says
 
04:37:08.230 --> 04:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
here's how the process generally goes
 
04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
here's where you find my rules and so
 
04:37:11.551 --> 04:37:11.561 align:start position:0%
forth so I think when you talk about
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
about that Improvement I think that
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
Improvement has already probably been
 
04:37:18.269 --> 04:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:21.070 --> 04:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
degree other questions representative
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
tur uh maybe somewhat related and and
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
maybe somewhat uh related to the
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
questions that I asked uh uh
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn as the sponsor um
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
assuming this passes and two years we or
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
some people that look like us find
 
04:37:39.269 --> 04:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves back judging this again um do
 
04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
you have a sense of what Metro tricks we
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
should use to determine the
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of your office I think you
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
I think that you could do things like
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
number of cases that were answered in ex
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
that were addressed inside the statutory
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
time periods and I believe that that's a
 
04:38:01.920 --> 04:38:02.869 align:start position:0%
time periods and I believe that that's a
good

04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:38:02.879 --> 04:38:05.150 align:start position:0%
good
metric

04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
metric
 
04:38:05.160 --> 04:38:07.470 align:start position:0%
metric
um

04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
how I'm kind of torn on what else
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
because you can't really have a
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
decision-based metric right because I'm
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
a neutral and you can't say well this
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
many times it went this way this many
 
04:38:24.150 --> 04:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
times it went that way you can't really
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
do that you can really only do things
 
04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
about how the process is working and if
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
the process
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
failed and I don't have another metric
 
04:38:33.840 --> 04:38:35.230 align:start position:0%
failed and I don't have another metric
for

04:38:35.230 --> 04:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:38:39.390 --> 04:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
that other questions so I guess I have a
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
question Mr K I'm wondering
 
04:38:43.869 --> 04:38:43.879 align:start position:0%
what would you think
 
04:38:49.750 --> 04:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
if suppose that that your position was
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
changed from not so much being another
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
adjudicator suppose we we change the
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
position to make you what I what I would
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
refer to as something I would think of
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
that I would think of when you talk to
 
04:39:07.869 --> 04:39:07.879 align:start position:0%
and I'm talk of an udman in other words
 
04:39:10.109 --> 04:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
suppose we made your position more like
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer advoc before the Pu so that
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
we said you don't get to decide anything
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
but somebody who thinks that a
 
04:39:24.189 --> 04:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
municipality or or the state has not
 
04:39:26.910 --> 04:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
treated them fairly with regard to the
 
04:39:30.349 --> 04:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
rights of nolaw they can come to you and
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
if you think so too or if you think they
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
have a valid case then you'll represent
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
them before the court um you know for
 
04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
free maybe free of charge or whatever
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that that has been suggested by
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
people that because the name says on
 
04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
budsman they ought to be doing something
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
different however the statute doesn't
 
04:39:52.350 --> 04:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
set it oh no I agree uh and I my office
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
could have that function but it couldn't
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
have that function with one person I you
 
04:39:59.670 --> 04:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
could have potentially you could have
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
someone that performs that function in
 
04:40:02.590 --> 04:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
the office but they would have to be
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
different from the function that the
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
person that decides the case right right
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
no I was just saying what what if we
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
instead of having both we just said that
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
your function the function of your
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
office would be not to decide cases but
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
to Advocate I I I leave that to the
 
04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
determination of the
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislature all right other questions
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
very much sir thank
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%

04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
weaponization of the process that she
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
had experienced at the hands of the
 
04:42:43.150 --> 04:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
Rochester City
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
attorney after reviewing her right to
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
know requests and the rules governing
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
the RKO I agreed to advocate for her for

no

04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
compensation the attorney for the City
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
of Rochester immediately began
 
04:42:58.150 --> 04:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous lawfare tactics against me
 
04:43:00.150 --> 04:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
and the citizen in a complete abuse of
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
the process I was twice investigated by
 
04:43:04.510 --> 04:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office for the
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
unauthorized practice of law even though
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
the rkr already ruled that this is not a
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
court but he has the authority of a
 
04:43:14.590 --> 04:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
superior court judge on matters
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%

budsman as its longest running
 
04:43:30.510 --> 04:43:30.520 align:start position:0%

the position of the right to know um
 
04:43:35.390 --> 04:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
budsman but this enabling bill as
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
written does not go far enough to
 
04:43:40.110 --> 04:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
empower the Ombudsman to do his job
 
04:43:40.120 --> 04:43:41.628 align:start position:0%

04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
first the RKO needs additional staff at
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
least a shared office manager and a
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
pargal to assist with the overwhelming

case load of work second the um budsman
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be moved to a more respectable
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%

discourteous manner or otherwise
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
erroneous I would like to share with the
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee that Ombudsman attorney Thomas
 
04:44:58.750 --> 04:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
car has done a phenomenal job despite
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
the huge workload the lack of resources
 
04:45:03.550 --> 04:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
and the severe disrespect he has
 
04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
received from the city attorney of
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
rochest yes it has been a bumpy start
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
yes it could be less litigious but that
 
04:45:12.510 --> 04:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
require the um budman's ability to
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
restrain the lawfare tactics of the
 
04:45:16.990 --> 04:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
towns and City legal representatives and
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
finally the RKO should continue to be a
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
citizen-friendly forum to ask for and
 
04:45:24.030 --> 04:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
receive the public records of our
 
04:45:26.430 --> 04:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
government without fear of Retribution
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
legal action or reprisals by our own
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
City governments for simply asking for
 
04:45:33.150 --> 04:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
public documents thank you for your
 
04:45:34.590 --> 04:45:34.600 align:start position:0%

please good afternoon honorable

Judiciary Committee members my name is

Katherine coko I represent right to know
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are an all volunteer
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
grass SCS group of individuals concerned
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
with transparency and the effective
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of 91 our RSA 91a in
 
04:46:19.628 --> 04:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
keeping with the spirit of public access
 
04:46:21.670 --> 04:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
to public information we've been
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the formation of right to
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
know related legislation since
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 2012 including the
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
creation of the ombudsman's office we
 
04:46:31.150 --> 04:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
have a very broad base of members and
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
interested participants who have real
 
04:46:35.070 --> 04:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
world experience and are often very
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
often in very nuanced applications of
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
the right to know law right to know New
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire strongly supports h
 
04:46:44.110 --> 04:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
hb11 which reauthorizes the office of
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman for an additional two
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
years as attorney care stated um I had
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
an informal conversation with him I had
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
some of the same data he's received
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 275 inquiries with 76
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
different respondents and had 43 cases
 
04:47:00.750 --> 04:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
since the Inception of the office some
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
of those cases reflect Consolidated
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
inquiries some of those inquiries never
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
become cases so the counting is a little
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
bit difficult to follow I understand the
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
importance of this office is in its role
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
as an alternative to Superior Court a
 
04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
less formal and less costly means for
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
requesters to get clarification on the
 
04:47:21.070 --> 04:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
practices that public bodies use when
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
they are implementing the right to no
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
law and I can speak from meaningful
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
experience I have gone through both a
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
lengthy and very costly year year-long
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
right to no court process which is one
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I'm in the role I am now
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
and an adjudicative process with the
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
right to no Ombudsman even though the
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office was still forming at
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
the time when I filed my complaint I
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
believe I was a second case third case
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
maybe something something right up on
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
the top of that list um the process
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
there was much simpler than the court
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
process that I had undergone the year
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
before also my Superior Court Judge
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to know or um particularly
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
dive into the Nuance of the right to no
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
law the RKO understands the right to no
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
law and its precedents and is able to
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
articul at those throughout the course
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the process as you go through it this
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
is an area of law where it is hard to
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
find both attorneys and judges who are
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
deep in the Weeds on the application of
 
04:48:24.110 --> 04:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
91a but it is critically important as it
 
04:48:25.948 --> 04:48:25.958 align:start position:0%
is the only statute guaranteeing access
 
04:48:27.868 --> 04:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
to government information by a lay
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
person in my right to no case with the
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
RKO which I'm providing as an example
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
the town of Milford had held an
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
emergency meeting under RSA 91a the
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
reason for that emergency meeting must
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
be given in the minutes of the meeting
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
that is done in part to justify lack of
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient notice that's provided to the
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
public because an emergency meeting is
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
usually um 24 hours within 24 hours or
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
something like that the chair of the
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
board in that case decided that the
 
04:48:57.788 --> 04:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
reason for the non-public meeting would
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
be given or the reason for the meeting
 
04:49:01.390 --> 04:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
would be given in the non-public session
 
04:49:03.150 --> 04:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
of the minutes therefore checking the
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
Box fulfilling the requirement as far as
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
he was concerned and the board was
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
concerned but not telling the public
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
what the reason was it Justified having
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
an emergency session without any
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
notification to the public I challenged
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
that decision and I won the reason for
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
the meeting must be publicly available
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
the RKO stressed that and the town was
 
04:49:23.628 --> 04:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
required to revise their minutes
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately and include that this is a
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
very simple case and a type of action
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
that by itself would not have been
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
corrected if simply correcting that
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
required an entire court case there are
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
many examples that we at right to know
 
04:49:38.670 --> 04:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
see when people call us and ask us
 
04:49:40.030 --> 04:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
questions about actions that have been
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
taken they don't rise to the level of
 
04:49:43.390 --> 04:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
needing to go through court but they
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
start to add up to create a lack of
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
transparency in the way that things are
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
done many towns take small actions like
 
04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
these interpreting the statute as they
 
04:49:54.990 --> 04:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
see it without any recourse to the
 
04:49:56.708 --> 04:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
public other than that expensive court
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
case the ombudsman's office provides a
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
much needed alternative for course
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
correction and in my however in my case
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
and in others it is true public bodies
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
are bringing in legal counsel um
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
something that I didn't expect I think
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
the original ators of the ombudsman's
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
office anticipated it would be slightly
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
less formal they are bringing in legal
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
counsel and fighting procedural
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections using legal tactics that
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
weren't foreseen by the committee that
 
04:50:23.190 --> 04:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
created the Office that's why you're
 
04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
hearing some of this feedback
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
particularly about Rochester but it is
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
not unique to Rochester when I met um in
 
04:50:32.350 --> 04:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
my pre-trial uh conference with the
 
04:50:34.590 --> 04:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office uh Town Council was
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
very clear with me that if I was not
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
willing to do a declaratory judgment
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
with the town of Milford meaning that we
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
both submit our arguments only in
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
writing and forego an oral hearing which
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
I was something I wanted to do anyway um
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
he would be pursuing attorney's cost for
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
me based on what he claimed were an
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
excessive number of requests to the town
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
of Milford now I'm in a role where I'm
 
04:50:58.110 --> 04:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
fairly confident that I understand what
 
04:51:00.030 --> 04:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
that threshold is and wasn't concerned
 
04:51:01.628 --> 04:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
about that particular threat and went
 
04:51:03.708 --> 04:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
ahead with a declaratory judgment but it
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
is something that um is held over the
 
04:51:08.830 --> 04:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
heads of people who are inexperienced
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
with the system that the town is is
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to come after them for those fees
 
04:51:14.190 --> 04:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
because they feel that they can get them
 
04:51:15.670 --> 04:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
through the ombudsman's office in
 
04:51:17.948 --> 04:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
addition to as an alternative to getting
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
them through
 
04:51:22.548 --> 04:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
Court um it was not intended to be used
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
by attorneys but communities are
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
choosing to send their legal counsel and
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
then they are asking um why they have to
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
Shell out those costs I would encourage
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
you it sounds like most have read the
 
04:51:35.190 --> 04:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
email testimony from right to no member
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
and Rochester resident Tracy wallbridge
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
about the situation that she encountered
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
in Rochester I do think that is very
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
unique that is not um what the majority
 
04:51:45.628 --> 04:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
of the cases are like finally and
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
probably most significantly the RKO is
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
not resourced we would like to see them
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
receive resources that would provide him
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
with basic supplies administrative
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
support a support role that is qualified
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
to serve as an advocate um because he is
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
the person who is handling all of the
 
04:52:04.310 --> 04:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
hearings he has to be impartial he
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
cannot discuss situations or give advice
 
04:52:09.708 --> 04:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
so there is no one that an individual
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
can pick up the phone and call and say
 
04:52:14.830 --> 04:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
hey I'm in this situation um what does
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
the law say about this what kind of
 
04:52:18.510 --> 04:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
conversation should I be having with my
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
municipality I think there was some hope
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
the office would do that if he had
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
someone that he could bifurcate that
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility off to then the office
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
would be able to be of more assistance
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
in that way and finally um he has
 
04:52:33.030 --> 04:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the need for a users's guide I
 
04:52:34.548 --> 04:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
think that would be extremely helpful
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
for people right now they're trying to
 
04:52:38.030 --> 04:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
navigate using the administrative rules
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
that have been put together um we to
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire did weigh in on those
 
04:52:44.110 --> 04:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh but I do think that it would be
 
04:52:45.628 --> 04:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
easier for someone to navigate if they
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
had a userfriendly document that could
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
guide them through the filing
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
process I will conclude my testimony
 
04:52:58.310 --> 04:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.548 --> 04:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:53:07.628 --> 04:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for allowing my
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
question uh Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:53:11.470 --> 04:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
for taking taking my question
 
04:53:14.230 --> 04:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
um could you elaborate a little bit more
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
on I guess what the biggest difficulties
 
04:53:19.948 --> 04:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
that you've seen for those who are using
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
the udman office like are there you know
 
04:53:26.590 --> 04:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
just I you talk to a lot of different
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
people throughout the day and what are
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
you hearing from those who are who are
 
04:53:33.868 --> 04:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
in your organization I I think the
 
04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
challenge is that they are not attorneys
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
so it is navigating a quasi legal
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
process um and understanding some of the
 
04:53:44.910 --> 04:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
language that comes from the rco's
 
04:53:47.548 --> 04:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
office um he's very clear in his
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
Communications about what is needed but
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's in a very structured way that most
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
people aren't used to communicating in
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think that's the biggest
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
challenge and that if we could simplify
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
that in some way that would be great I
 
04:54:03.150 --> 04:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
would not like to see the need for that
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
become a barrier to continuing the
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
office the office is providing a service
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
that has been tremendously helpful in
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
preventing people from needing to go to
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
court and then solving other resolving
 
04:54:17.230 --> 04:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
cases that probably wouldn't otherwise
 
04:54:17.240 --> 04:54:18.270 align:start position:0%
cases that probably wouldn't otherwise
be

04:54:18.270 --> 04:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
heard other questions for this witness
 
04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%

next the person's first name is Joe and
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%

Haas good afternoon from
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
gilmington I put down one and a half
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
minutes okay then then that's then
 
04:54:52.350 --> 04:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
that's the same card go ahead Mr H
 
04:54:54.270 --> 04:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
welcome yeah I just wanted to say on the
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
past tense I I have taken a right to
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
know case in Ashlin uh back in the 1980s
 
04:55:03.310 --> 04:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
to the Superior Court in Grafton County
 
04:55:05.788 --> 04:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
and I won the case that was on trying to
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
get the town lease on a tax sale of my
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
property I cited a union leader uh case
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
on that and won it and I didn't get
 
04:55:16.390 --> 04:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
attorney fees because I didn't hire an
 
04:55:17.948 --> 04:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
attorney but I should have gotten
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
something I think so let me just tell
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
you what I put into the uh Belmont case
 
04:55:40.510 --> 04:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh the previous speaker talk
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
talked about hearings and postings and
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I'm just talking about
 
04:55:49.948 --> 04:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
documents that I want from this town and
 
04:55:53.110 --> 04:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
some other places the common denominator
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
is out west kingcast Chris King I don't
 
04:55:58.670 --> 04:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
know if you remember him he was used to
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
be in the state and filming Kelly aart
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere she goes and stuff but
 
04:56:05.430 --> 04:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
anyways he found a case out there that I
 
04:56:08.590 --> 04:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
cited in the Belmont case and it says
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the y upon the person
 
04:56:14.030 --> 04:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
withholding the documents that are
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be released within five
 
04:56:16.200 --> 04:56:17.350 align:start position:0%
supposed to be released within five
business

04:56:17.350 --> 04:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
days for each day over that the $7 per
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
day per page charge is applicable and I
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
think in the statute he has the power to
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
find the opposition that uh did not
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
comply with the statute up to
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
$2,000 so my suggestion is perhaps you
 
04:56:38.430 --> 04:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
could put in there that the litigant uh
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
the complainant uh could get get maybe
 
04:56:43.470 --> 04:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
10% as a finder fee as as a
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
whistleblower uh amount to uh offset
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
their expenses all right any questions
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
for this witness thank you seeing none
 
04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um next I'm going to
 
04:56:56.520 --> 04:56:57.830 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um next I'm going to
uh

04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:57.840 --> 04:57:00.510 align:start position:0%
uh
Lori

04:57:00.510 --> 04:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
Lori
 
04:57:14.948 --> 04:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon you got it
 
04:57:21.788 --> 04:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
perfect um nice to see you all um couple
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
quick things so I did a quasi judicial
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
hearing with the btla when I first
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
started with uh issues with my property
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
I had the choice of going into Superior
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
Court or through the board of tax and
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
land appeal for my property appeal and
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
looking back having no experience at all
 
04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
best decision I made was going to the
 
04:57:45.070 --> 04:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
btla it's much less formal it's quasi
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
judicial it's a panel of three that do
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
land disputes all day every day and it
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
was easy uh the forms the office
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
interfacing it was easy now they're they
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
have more resources than attorney cor
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
ker in that there's two assistants and
 
04:58:03.548 --> 04:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
the three members and I think one other
 
04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
part-time person so they're resourced
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
pretty well but I will tell you looking
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
back I thought that was great and anyone
 
04:58:13.150 --> 04:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
whoever calls me that is entering into a
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
property abatement appeal I always say
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
go to the btla cuz the courts are busy
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
they focus on all kinds of law they're
 
04:58:23.470 --> 04:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
not specifically focused on land issues
 
04:58:25.628 --> 04:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
you get this focused group and those
 
04:58:27.628 --> 04:58:27.638 align:start position:0%
three individuals up there I thought
 
04:58:30.270 --> 04:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
were very talented very knowledgeable
 
04:58:32.030 --> 04:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
now regarding the court versus the um
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
budsman and I'm here representing right
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
to know New Hampshire as well as a
 
04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
member and um I support this legislation
 
04:58:41.708 --> 04:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
um I know there could be some amendments
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
to it but I'd like to see this office
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
keep going and have an opportunity to
 
04:58:47.590 --> 04:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
develop a little more I think it's
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
extremely worthwhile and I have not used
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
the office for various reasons which
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
I'll explain but I think the UN budsman
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
office when it comes to costs clearly
 
04:58:58.270 --> 04:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
it's less costly just from a filing
 
04:59:00.788 --> 04:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
standpoint citizens have a much easier
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
ability to get in there on 25 bucks and
 
04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
going into the um court system and
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
paying the 280 the other thing is the
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
the superior court system when you file
 
04:59:12.750 --> 04:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
and you're wrapped into that turbo court
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
and odyssey system for filing it's
 
04:59:17.830 --> 04:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
pretty darn dated it is difficult when
 
04:59:21.150 --> 04:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
you're a citizen working through the
 
04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
court process of getting your website
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
logging on filing the proper forms
 
04:59:29.948 --> 04:59:29.958 align:start position:0%
following up it is really complicated it
 
04:59:33.390 --> 04:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
is really hard um you have to call for
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
assistance often I don't think that I'm
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
a I'm a proos say l again I don't think
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're the the most liked people um
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
because we're time consuming cuz we
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
don't we don't get it you know and and
 
04:59:47.670 --> 04:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're burdensome so when you go to an
 
04:59:49.948 --> 04:59:49.958 align:start position:0%
office like Deon budsman where that's
 
04:59:51.910 --> 04:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much all all they deal with or
 
04:59:53.788 --> 04:59:53.798 align:start position:0%
the btla that's all they deal with
 
04:59:55.948 --> 04:59:55.958 align:start position:0%
people like um individuals who are not
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
represented they have a lot of patience
 
05:00:00.510 --> 05:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
for us and they have a lot Le less
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
complexity built in so I think the user
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
friendliness of the forms is very
 
05:00:08.430 --> 05:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
important time the courts are busy I
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
think they're very understaffed they may
 
05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
have staff like judges may have
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
assistance but I was shocked to learn in
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
Superior Court each judge doesn't have
 
05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
their own personal assistant they share
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
them with other judges I was shocked
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
NASA only has two Superior Court judges
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
for a city and a jurisdiction that is as
 
05:00:28.948 --> 05:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
large as it is in the past there were
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
three or four there's only two they are
 
05:00:36.910 --> 05:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
so busy and so you know RSA 91a afford
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
you a priority hearing expedited they
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
don't have time
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
they have an administrative rule called
 
05:00:45.070 --> 05:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
AO 201308 they don't really have an
 
05:00:47.230 --> 05:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to follow it so my first
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
right to know case took two and a half
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
years I just came out of court with a
 
05:00:54.990 --> 05:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
right to Noe case um last um year by
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
July that took a full two years to go
 
05:01:00.510 --> 05:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
through Court that's a long time and
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
with that comes a lot of costs because
 
05:01:04.708 --> 05:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
the other side when a city goes into
 
05:01:06.270 --> 05:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
court they're not sending in their
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
administrator they're sending in a legal
 
05:01:10.548 --> 05:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
team my last right to know they put five
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers against me it was a huge team I
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
was alone that whole case for 2 years
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
cost me maybe $115,000 of my own
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
expenses the city invested 600 Grand
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
paying two outside attorneys to try to
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
beat me on that case that's a lot of
 
05:01:28.750 --> 05:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
money I I don't want to see that happen
 
05:01:31.628 --> 05:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
to Citizens so I'm a big advocate of
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
this office when it comes to metrics
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned metrics how do we
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
measure performance you know I think one
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
of the ways is isn't just time to
 
05:01:43.390 --> 05:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
resolve but how many of those
 
05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities use the lawyer to come in
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
and represent them and how many of those
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
citizens required a lawyer to to have
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
their case represented because if I
 
05:01:55.230 --> 05:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
think I think if you can show that that
 
05:01:59.548 --> 05:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
office is operating with less legal um
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
tentacles working its way in there then
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
you are doing a great job of really
 
05:02:06.910 --> 05:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
making something citizen friendly and um
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
and trying to mediate and negotiate
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
something that's to the you know the
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
greater good of both parties you both
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
got to give something to get there you
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
know even when the court orders
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
mediation and you're in a judicial
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
process a lot of times I know twice
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
there was mediation ordered the judge
 
05:02:24.190 --> 05:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
Cav six lawyers none of them were ever
 
05:02:27.150 --> 05:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
available nobody's available so but I
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
think going through the um budsman
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to really have the
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to mediate um
 
05:02:36.430 --> 05:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
so you know in the idea that Justice
 
05:02:39.070 --> 05:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
Lynn brought up on consumer Advocate and
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
then um you know making a a a using the
 
05:02:45.948 --> 05:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
utsman to give a position and and then
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
being the individual to go into court
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not big on that because I just see
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
the burden in court um in and the tie
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
down and the cost and the demand on the
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
judges and the individual it's so
 
05:03:00.548 --> 05:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
personally stressful to represent
 
05:03:03.030 --> 05:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
yourself as a proa litigant in court I
 
05:03:04.990 --> 05:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you how stressful it's been
 
05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
I paid a quarter of a million dollars
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
for my first lawsuit and then after that
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
I filed on on my own I said never again
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
am I going through that and even on your
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
own I'm always up against three four
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
five lawyers it is so stressful and I
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
don't go to the udman office because I
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
happen to be in a city that like
 
05:03:26.030 --> 05:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
Rochester I think is really difficult
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
and I was a very big advocate of the
 
05:03:30.510 --> 05:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
utsman office and I didn't want that
 
05:03:32.548 --> 05:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
gentleman to puncture both eardrums and
 
05:03:34.110 --> 05:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
want to drive a pen through his eye
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
because NASA was coming to his office I
 
05:03:39.070 --> 05:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
really didn't want to see that happen I
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted n to stay away because I felt
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
like what happened in Rochester would be
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what NASA would do up there and
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
I did not want that to happen so anyone
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
in NASA that has issues I don't
 
05:03:53.070 --> 05:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
encourage them to go to the utsman but
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
towns outside and through my right to
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
know work I really do encourage them to
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
go to the utsman make a go of it so I
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
think I think we want to invest in this
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to see like um attorney
 
05:04:07.708 --> 05:04:07.718 align:start position:0%
Belleville and Miss coko recommended
 
05:04:10.110 --> 05:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
some pargal assistant or somebody even
 
05:04:12.548 --> 05:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's part-time halftime and I know this
 
05:04:14.350 --> 05:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
budget is under the state is under
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous budget stress um but if it's
 
05:04:20.548 --> 05:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
possible then I think it would be super
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
beneficial if it isn't then we give it a
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
go the way we're going and we accept
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we have um and and try to you know
 
05:04:30.270 --> 05:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
get this user guide out and do a few
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
small things to drive Improvement and we
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
let it keep working I I'm I'm really a
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
proponent of that so I hope I'm I'm glad
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
to see the two years would mind seeing
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
it without 2 years and just roll and
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
monitor monitoring is important always
 
05:04:48.990 --> 05:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
have a handle on the the efficiency of
 
05:04:51.310 --> 05:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
of government so that's my input thank
 
05:04:53.310 --> 05:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you questions for
 
05:04:53.320 --> 05:04:54.948 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you questions for
this

05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
we representative Manos thank you Mr
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I wanted to know uh whether in
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
your view the edsman currently lacks the
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
safeguards necessary to protect
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
individuals from retaliatory actions by
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
by municipalities or agencies and if you
 
05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
do agree with that what um additional
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
safeguards would you say are
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
necessary well I would say I do agree
 
05:05:23.708 --> 05:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
with that just because it wasn't
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily foreseen when the
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules were put in place
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:36.150 --> 05:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't want to see lawyers have
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
open Reign to come in here and obviously
 
05:05:40.990 --> 05:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
um take control of a process that's
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be quasi judicial and really
 
05:05:45.628 --> 05:05:45.638 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism for citizens to open
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
records and mediate I don't know how to
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
word that or make that happen I don't
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
think I can give you a a good answer off
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I do think it can
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
happen and I do think it h I think I
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
think in Tracy wri's case it did happen
 
05:06:01.470 --> 05:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
and we don't want that to happen and
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
that may be an outlier but it can happen
 
05:06:06.910 --> 05:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's I believe it would happen in nasua
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is why I won't go there I will not
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
in take that mess to a gentleman's
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
office that is run by one person I just
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it other questions for
 
05:06:17.440 --> 05:06:18.310 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it other questions for
this

05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
witness seeing seeing none thank you

05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%

05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Aon crean general counsel
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
for the court system uh making a very
 
05:06:46.990 --> 05:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
rough effort to get some data for you
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
just for your
 
05:06:52.230 --> 05:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
consideration um we did a little um
 
05:06:54.590 --> 05:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
manual count spot count through the past
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
year and it does look like we have had a
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
substantial decline in right to no
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
filings in the Superior Court System
 
05:07:04.030 --> 05:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
since the implementation of this bill um
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
I think our based on an anecdotal sample
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
of Clerks it looks like around 40 to 40
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
45 cases a year were filed and that may
 
05:07:15.390 --> 05:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
be in our spot check below 10 in the
 
05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
last year which is a it's not a very
 
05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
large and and popular case type but it
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
is a substantial decline percentage wise
 
05:07:24.948 --> 05:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
certainly um so I did want to mention
 
05:07:26.548 --> 05:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
that to you for your awareness it does
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
seem that um many are choosing to
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the right the Ombudsman
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
process as opposed to go to Superior
 
05:07:36.548 --> 05:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.070 --> 05:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
option that that is that's very helpful
 
05:07:41.430 --> 05:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
question for this witness yes
 
05:07:41.440 --> 05:07:42.868 align:start position:0%

approximately how many of those 10 might

have been cases that were being appealed
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
from the um abun office it looks like
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%

05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%

05:08:31.788 --> 05:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
of the co-sponsors of the bill
 
05:08:34.270 --> 05:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thank you
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you committee I'm
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief because Caitlyn's
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to take over for me but um this
 
05:08:43.230 --> 05:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is condemning the judicial
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
doctrine of desperate impact and you
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a letter in hand which Caitlyn's
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
going to go over with you a little bit
 
05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
but I want to tell you how I ended up
 
05:08:56.110 --> 05:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
getting involved in this first of all I
 
05:08:59.070 --> 05:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
had to look up the definition and um
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
desperate desper desperate impact uh
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
also is considered adverse impact
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
commonly refers to
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
unintentional discrimin atory PR
 
05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
practice and that's the key word here is
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
that it is unintentional
 
05:09:18.670 --> 05:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um practice and the
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
reason why and and after Caitlyn reads
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
this you'll know a little bit more but
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why I ended up supporting
 
05:09:29.590 --> 05:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
this with um representative Belcher is
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
because I used he approached me about a
 
05:09:37.628 --> 05:09:37.638 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement case where it was and
 
05:09:40.670 --> 05:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
he refers generally to to it that there
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
was um in an area of um people of color
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh poorly educated um graduating from
 
05:09:53.830 --> 05:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
high school um unable to be uh read and
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
write at an appropriate level and they
 
05:10:01.150 --> 05:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
someone applied to a um police
 
05:10:03.750 --> 05:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
department and part of the requirements
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
is that you had to fill out the
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
forms and they were um un able to fill
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
out the fs forms because of their lack
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
of um education and it's ended up going
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
to court and I believe it is still in
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
court so they filed that they felt that
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
the practice of remember I'm a nurse not
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
a lawyer um the practice this practice
 
05:10:33.830 --> 05:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
meant that they had a their policy of
 
05:10:37.230 --> 05:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
having to read and write these things
 
05:10:39.788 --> 05:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
was uh discriminating against them
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
because they were people of
 
05:10:46.910 --> 05:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
color I have a concern about another way
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
that that may have happened in the long
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
past and I'm talking probably 30 or 40
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
years ago having had two firefighter um
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters in my family um there were
 
05:11:01.708 --> 05:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
certain rules around being a firefighter
 
05:11:03.868 --> 05:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
I can remember one specifically is you
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
had to be able to carry 110 pound person
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
out of a out of a burning building the
 
05:11:12.430 --> 05:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
other one was at that time that you had
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh you had to have a
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
physical every year and part of that
 
05:11:19.350 --> 05:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
physical was to make sure that you were
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
able to do certain requirements of the
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
job being for example hook up the hose
 
05:11:28.670 --> 05:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
in a certain amount of time or that type
 
05:11:33.548 --> 05:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
of thing and unfortunately back then um
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
women said that they were being
 
05:11:36.320 --> 05:11:37.868 align:start position:0%
women said that they were being
discriminated

05:11:37.868 --> 05:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
discriminated
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
against um under this type of it was an
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
inv totally
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
involuntary they they the reasons for
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
these things that they required for this
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
position were for the safety of the
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
individuals and the safety of the
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
community so basically they ended up
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
because of this lowering the standards
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
for the fire department or for in order
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
to allow women to be part of it so I'm
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
going to let them read it this came
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually came up in some hearings the
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
same type of thing came up in some
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
hearings yesterday um at the Senate so
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let her read this to you
 
05:12:26.670 --> 05:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
please Caitlyn and I apologize that I
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
have to leave um and of course
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
belur wife is in labor so I'll take a
 
05:12:38.190 --> 05:12:38.200 align:start position:0%
quick question but you're probably
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
better off to have Caitlyn read it and
 
05:12:43.230 --> 05:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
we can probably discuss it more after
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
other people talk discuss it more in
 
05:12:49.948 --> 05:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
executive session sure uh any qu briefly
 
05:12:51.390 --> 05:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Perez
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Oregan do you have a
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
question well maybe this wait for the
 
05:12:56.430 --> 05:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
executive session but I just notice the
 
05:12:59.310 --> 05:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
last line he wants to transmit it to the
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
president of United States who's not
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned by name the president's
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
changed since he filed it the members of
 
05:13:05.310 --> 05:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
the ire Congressional I'm sorry where
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
are you oh on the actual resolution
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
itself on line 1
 
05:13:12.190 --> 05:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
and he named honorable Chris senu the
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
governor who's now no longer the
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
governor so uh would you prefer I guess
 
05:13:19.548 --> 05:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
the exective session address the issue
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
of how to how he should reward it
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
whether just be the governor of New the
 
05:13:26.548 --> 05:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire whether they want
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
name amended at that time so rep
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative bur but make it quick
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay please thank you yes thank you and
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh you
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
use the term unintentional which I don't
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
understand stand to be part of disperate
 
05:13:46.070 --> 05:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh impact law could you excuse me I'm
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
sorry my question is could you identify
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
either where in the Griggs case or in
 
05:13:58.750 --> 05:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
section 703 of the Civil Rights Act is
 
05:14:00.030 --> 05:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
the word
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
unintentional no I can't and I apologize
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
as I say and if you read what um
 
05:14:08.548 --> 05:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
representative belter put forward you
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
can see that he is far more informed and
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
literate about this particular case
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you okay all right thank you other
 
05:14:19.230 --> 05:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
question no thank you very much thank
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
all right um representative kab do you
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
have in the interest of time does
 
05:14:26.350 --> 05:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
everybody want me to read this whole
 
05:14:27.548 --> 05:14:27.558 align:start position:0%
thing or does every would everybody
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
prefer to read this on their own I think
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
we've read I've I've read it so read it
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
okay everybody said okay perfect all
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
right so uh next uh um max
 
05:14:46.590 --> 05:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
Gard afternoon um I'm here to testify in
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill um disperate
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
impact is a judicial doctrine that has
 
05:15:00.190 --> 05:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
been recognized for decades as um going
 
05:15:02.670 --> 05:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
back as far as the Civil Rights Act um
 
05:15:06.830 --> 05:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
but as recently um as the Supreme Court
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
decision um Texas Department of Housing
 
05:15:12.390 --> 05:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and Community Affairs versus inclusive
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
communities project Incorporated um a
 
05:15:18.030 --> 05:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case in
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
2015 um specifically intended to include
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
um and allow uh disperate impact claims
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
um so first I think it's strange that
 
05:15:31.470 --> 05:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is you know seeking
 
05:15:34.548 --> 05:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
through a house resolution to overturn
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh judicial doctrines recognized by the
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously not a lawyer so I don't
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
understand if a state can overturn
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
National Judiciary doctrines like that
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the first place um but I think it's
 
05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh ridiculous to uh be overturning the
 
05:15:59.350 --> 05:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the idea that a rule if a rule on its
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
face seems to apply equally but then the
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
outcome is not equal um
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
such as the rules that were placed on
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
African-Americans in order to vote uh
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
before the 1964 Civil Rights Act um
 
05:16:21.070 --> 05:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
which were constructed in a way to
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
appear on its face to be an equal rule
 
05:16:27.750 --> 05:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
but in practice was uh quite
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and that is what the idea
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
of disperate impact as a general
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
principle is trying to address um I have
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
additional concerns about the actual
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
wording in the bill um the first
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
sentence of the bill is whereas the
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
practice of
 
05:16:47.830 --> 05:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
unit analysis for complex real world
 
05:16:50.670 --> 05:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
phenomena is illegitimate and
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
unscientific um which univer analysis is
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
looking at a problem in terms of one
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
variable at a time which anyone who's
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
gone through like you know High School
 
05:17:02.320 --> 05:17:03.910 align:start position:0%
gone through like you know High School
science

05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
science
 
05:17:07.628 --> 05:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
um is a valid scientific method anyone
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
who's done like you know a Cen Mentos
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
experiment uh can know that looking at
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
one variable at a time is a valid
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
scientific method um does it uh is
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
should all problems always be viewed
 
05:17:26.590 --> 05:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
through one variable at a time obviously
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
not but to say unilaterally that the
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
practice of univariate analysis for
 
05:17:34.510 --> 05:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
complex real word phenomena is
 
05:17:36.270 --> 05:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
illegitimate and
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
unscientific uh I think is just
 
05:17:44.548 --> 05:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
going a step so far removed from reality
 
05:17:49.310 --> 05:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
um uh it then goes on to say that that
 
05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh univariate analysis produces
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
conclusions such as thing one happened
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
then thing to happened therefore the
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
first thing was causitive of the second
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
thing um I think it's a dangerous idea
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
to uh attack
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
causality um as a thing that can be
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
known obviously that thing one happened
 
05:18:15.390 --> 05:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
and then thing two happened it is not in
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
this little individual sentence here um
 
05:18:23.110 --> 05:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's not uh impossible that thing one
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't caused by didn't cause thing two
 
05:18:28.548 --> 05:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
but to say that thing one happened then
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
thing two happened therefore the thing
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
first thing was causitive is just an
 
05:18:34.320 --> 05:18:35.830 align:start position:0%
first thing was causitive is just an
illogical

05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
illogical
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
construction um used to then just ify
