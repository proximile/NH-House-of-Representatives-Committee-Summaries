Maguire good to you this one has my

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
the only change from yesterday is the
 
00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's 163,000 now it was
 
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
100,00 th000
 
00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
yesterday that's to account for the
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:28.830 align:start position:0%

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
okay you may recall yesterday we did
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
and I think of the motion was made by
 
00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.550 align:start position:0%
and I think of the motion was made by
representative

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
grassie just want to make sure
 
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
recall so Mike you put in the the two
 
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
little changes that representative Leon
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah could you point us in that
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
line one thing we fail to get yes this
 
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
269,000 we failed to get yesterday
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
represent guire you had asked for a
 
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown of group two employees from
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
liquor and I don't think we received
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
that and skip that oh in the
 
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
bill yeah you had asked I my notes that
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
you they have a list of 10 or so people
 
00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 align:start position:0%
and that was in the other bill I don't
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
know if it's in
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
toel all the models in here franchising
 
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.909 align:start position:0%
toel all the models in here franchising
agent

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
agent
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
decision on on page five just a
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
definition so which one are we is this
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
law so this bill is the agency model uh
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it defines all other possible models
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
but it is the agency this is the Run by
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
St the agency
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
not run by state liquor
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
but regulated by state liquor owned
 
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.589 align:start position:0%
but regulated by state liquor owned
privately

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
correct the lay
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
model no what some members of the senate
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
senate hasn't taken a position yet
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
allegedly because I've spoken to members
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
of the Senate and they have no they said
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
send over what you've got and we'll take
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
a look at it they haven't taken a
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
position on it yet from my
 
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.510 align:start position:0%
position on it yet from my
understanding

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:58.510 align:start position:0%
understanding
that's

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.469 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Maguire would like a
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
show of hands if possible that what we
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
see in front of us is what we believe
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 align:start position:0%
yesterday yeah yeah okay you don't
 
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:28.510 align:start position:0%
yesterday yeah yeah okay you don't
[Laughter]

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
agree

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
let's go to so we do have an issue
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
apparently with the county language
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
apologies Mr chairman Kate hen from the
 
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties so
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
page six 318 uh line
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
34 to page seven through line eight it
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
references the court doing electronic
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring and developing criteria to
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate but uh and that the court shall
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
order the person to reimburse the court
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
for payment of the cost of electronic
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring I think in those whole
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
sections you want it to say County and
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
not Court um because quite frankly the
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
court is not going to have anything to
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
do with the electronic monitoring
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
program so you probably want the
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
counties developing the criteria and the
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
counties getting reimbursed rather than
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
the court represent mire thank you so on
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page six I think let's
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
start let's go line by line yeah the
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
court shall order electronic monitoring
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
right yep that's fine okay the court
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
shall develop a criteria to determine
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether the person is Indigent or not
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
that that way we'll have a consistent
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
criteria um across the whole state which
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
I would think makes sense right yeah I I
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
would argue that each County program
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
looks very different and counties are
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
very different so being Indigent in one
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
County may not be Indigent in another
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
County and if you allow the courts to
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
use the standard that they use to
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not you are
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
Indigent for the purposes of getting an
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
attorney doesn't necessarily mean that
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
you are Indigent for purposes of paying
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
for electronic monitoring those are two
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
very different
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
standards okay what is what are others
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
think I mean I could go with that
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
this so re refresh our memories how did
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
this come out
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
originally from Criminal Justice it's
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
all court stuff it's it came out all
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
court stuff and but we moved it to the
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
you moved it all to the counties
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
yesterday but this piece is still with
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
the courts because Miss krian told us
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
the court doesn't have any pre-trial um
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
Division and therefore they can't do
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
see why wouldn't um on line five page
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
County why wouldn't that accomplish it
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
because doesn't the court isn't the
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
court the one who determines who's on
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
electric monitoring and who's not so it
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
is my understanding and aerin's not here
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
but it is my understanding that the
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
court suggests electronic monitor in but
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
force a county to use electronic
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring right now because statutorily
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
they are not required to have electronic
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring and not every county has
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring this changes
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
that but I
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
think I would the counties would be
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned if the courts are in
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
charge of determining incy and it's not
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
something that they can control for
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
program and payments look very different
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
from Marx's payments and programs which
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
looks very different from chesher which
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
Rockingham so like marac is like $7 a
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
day to be
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
week yeah but they straford offers
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to volunteer to work
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
that off so that you don't have to so I
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just arguing for the more
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
flexibility the better if you are going
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
this yeah I'm I I'm accept that's
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
acceptable to me I mean I I think um
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is a new
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
thing um let's let different counties do
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
what they want to do if one of them
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
turns out to be the most Superior way
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
and and the others are not then we could
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
later say okay everybody do it that way
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
right but but if we if we make a
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
decision here it has to be this way or
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
whatever then we precluded finding
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
that I don't know all of the details on
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
everyone's electronic monitoring so I
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want I only know maramax and
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
Stafford's numbers so I can't give
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
the details on rocking hams or Chesters
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but I could try
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and find out before 11:30 if that would
 
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.790 align:start position:0%
and find out before 11:30 if that would
be

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
helpful it's it's roughly a factor of
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
significant yeah I was just looking back
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
through the comparisons of the trying to
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.269 align:start position:0%
 
changed

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
I think In the comparison it was it was
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
courts and then uh I think
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire had an amendment
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
to make it the
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
counties and uh I kind of the division
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
went away from that and then went back
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
fight so Mr Hoffman what would be the
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
easy fix for you I just wanted to go
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
through what I think of the changes
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
before I go run it off perfect yeah uh
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of page
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
six line 34 we would change to the
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
county shall develop uniform
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
criteria top of page
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
seven line five the courtial order that
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
the person reimburse the
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
county and then on line nine same page
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
County finds the person is Indigent for
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
changes so line nine on page nine seven
 
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
changes so line nine on page nine seven
page

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
seven

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
so the clerk points out again line three
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
says so we
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.269 align:start position:0%
 
seven

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
14 yes question so three yep if we
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
change it to the court shall develop
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
uniform criteria is that where you went
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
the flexibility I think you you want
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
line three page seven yes so if the
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
Indigent yeah also line 15 on page seven
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
yeah but not
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
line uh
 
00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:04.870 align:start position:0%
line uh
14

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
right because conditions are imposed by
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
the court yeah right right so okay all
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
have okay so we have on page six line 34
 
00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
have okay so we have on page six line 34
line

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
36 and on page seven line
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
15 that look good with you Mr Hoffman
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
yes I'll have a changed in both
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendments the one with five and the one
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so there they have many eyes on
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
something absolutely there's a really
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
good reason why this whole process is so
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
slow and has so many steps and has the
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
third reading motion and has all that
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff it's for exactly things
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
like this that you know you want it to
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
be right at the end of the
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:27.710 align:start position:0%
 
11:30

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:57.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:27.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
for
