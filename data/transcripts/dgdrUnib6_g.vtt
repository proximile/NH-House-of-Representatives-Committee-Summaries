00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
that came through our committee uh back
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
in 2000 I think it was actually might
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
have been my first term in 2012 which
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
was a a fourth grade bill
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh what for those who people who
 
00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:38.899 align:start position:0%
are new
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
fourth graders always
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
almost all fourth graders in public
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire come to tour
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
the state house and they part of their
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
curriculum is learning about state
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
government and some fourth grade classes
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
put together bills and that they think
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
would be good and they contact their uh
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
their representative and the
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
representative will put it in for them
 
00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:05.150 align:start position:0%
representative will put it in for them
so

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill on that uh
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
representative O'Connor from Derry put
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
in at the request of the
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
um the fourth graders in his town and it
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
was a bill to make the potato the state
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
wonderful

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
when did that happen
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was 2012. yeah
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay or actually 2013 it would have been
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
2013 I think so it was the the session
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
that started in December of 2012 so uh
 
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.090 align:start position:0%
that started in December of 2012 so uh
yeah

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
I believe also that the first potatoes
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
were planted in Derry I believe that was
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that the Derry school
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
group um did that I'm not mistaken
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
that's correct and also but at that
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
point it was called nut field oh cool
 
00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:04.069 align:start position:0%
point it was called nut field oh cool
okay

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to um go through this
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
booklet a little bit but I see that Arc
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%

any questions that I get from chair
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
Aaron who usually goes through her
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
because I'm working on on behalf of the
 
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.890 align:start position:0%
because I'm working on on behalf of the
committee

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:35.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
and I will research you know legislative
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
history how many times have we done this
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
before and what happened or you know
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
what you know it's not for me to
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
interpret but to just present to you
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
this did it and that didn't
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
um or what other states are doing with a
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
given topic or you know even you know
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
what what have you in order for you guys
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
to make your considerations on the bills
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
that are in front of you so if you need
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
anything I mean you can always visit us
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
on the fourth floor but if you know take
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
officially the requests generally go
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
through the chair maybe even the vice
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
chair maybe the clerk you know you guys
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
can work that out for yourselves but um
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's just to distinguish us from you
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
know other researchers who you know you
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
might go to before you put in a bill or
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
um to do research for you individually
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody have any questions for
 
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.770 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody have any questions for
Kristen

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
just an additional point on that um I
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that in the event
 
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
that you need additional research for
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
something else you're working on
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
legislatively that goes through OLS so
 
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
as a personal legislative matter correct
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
and the I don't know that it's oh well
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
is it OLS it is OLS okay I think it is
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
all right right right okay thank you yep
 
00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.430 align:start position:0%
all right right right okay thank you yep
yep

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
I think that's yeah that's one of the
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
key distinctions is this is It's not
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
that everybody on the committee has to
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
want to know whatever it is I'm
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
researching but
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
so if we will generally be distributed
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know if if the chair chooses so if
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
we're working on a bill we've had a
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
committed hearing and we're doing a work
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
session or something and and any of you
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
have a specific question that you would
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
like to have researched like say for
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
instance what other what others what are
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
other states doing with regard to
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
um micro Enterprise home kitchen
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
operations you can pose a question to me
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
and then I would get in touch with
 
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.930 align:start position:0%
and then I would get in touch with
Kristen

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
Kristen
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so an actual
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
example was
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
um representative Compton and I were on

at soil conditioners and uh I asked uh
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
Ms Grant to
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
um look into what the fee structures in
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
neighboring states were for uh for
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
fertilizers and other soil amendments
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
and she provided a very thorough list
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
with some good commentaries so thank you
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%

recommendation from this committee uh
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
regarding those three
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
so I'll be working with uh Ollie you
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
folks here to figure out when to
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
regarding absences
 
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.210 align:start position:0%
regarding absences
um

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
I would like you to please let me know
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
and also let
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
um Peter representative Bixby know uh
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
when you will be unable to attend a
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
meeting whether it be hearings or
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
executive session just so that I know
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
and can anticipate when you will be
 
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.649 align:start position:0%
and can anticipate when you will be
absent

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
absent
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
today I know
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Morse is not with us
 
00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:44.539 align:start position:0%
because there's an illness
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
and representative verville is out of
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
state for business
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I haven't heard anything
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
from representative coulon so I don't
 
00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:56.570 align:start position:0%
from representative coulon so I don't
know

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.029 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
expecially for executive session when we
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
are voting on uh the disposition of any
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
we need to know whether you will be
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
present or not and um
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.529 align:start position:0%
uh the
uh

00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
for the Republicans they would let me
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
know the Democrats would let
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby know that way you
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
can arrange a substitute to come and
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
vote on the bill representative Bixby
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah just a little more detail detail on
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
that uh if uh you let
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
um one of us know soon enough uh within
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
so that we can give 24 hours notice then
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
we can get a substitute for you uh on
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
you know with the from the appropriate
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
party and but if uh if that notice comes
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
to us too late then we can't get a
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
substitute which means that there would
 
00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.909 align:start position:0%
substitute which means that there would
be

00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:58.919 --> 00:24:59.870 align:start position:0%
be
um a

00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
um a
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
there there wouldn't be a vote there
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
would be one vote missing from the
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
committee on that so um it's it's good
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
for practical reasons to make sure you

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
desktop here
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
um there are like little places
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
underneath the table you can put them
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
but it's just um it's a distraction and
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that uh everybody's
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking about distractions
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
um use of electronic devices
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
laptops if we need our laptops to take
 
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.529 align:start position:0%
laptops if we need our laptops to take
notes

00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:11.539 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%

00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
committee work
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
but you have to remember that when we
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
have our public hearings our attention
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
should be to the speakers and what they
 
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:26.900 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
we want to be very respectful with our
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
attention to our speakers and to each
 
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.870 align:start position:0%
attention to our speakers and to each
other

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that our any kind
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
of ringers on our phones are muted
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
so as not to be distracting if we get a
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
phone call an incoming phone call
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%

something to carry over if you want
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
snack bars or whatever they can go in
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
there and am I also talking sort of
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
um this term that this is your file
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
where all of the bills that are given to
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
you from Heather will sit and and this
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
is your one shot this is your copy that
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
you will receive for the bill and those
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%

committee day if they come back and you
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't have them and you want to refer to
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
a certain line in a bill it's
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
problematic unless you print out your
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
own copy and bring it back and forth but
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
these are those copies and those can be
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
left in your drawers as well yes
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
the the folder as well can no the folder
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
is is yes it sits at your table yes and
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
Heather collects it and then that's
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
correct some new stuff comes out that's
 
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
correct some new stuff comes out that's
correct

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
so the folder is basically how they will
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
collect it after each session and if
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's new stuff to be handed out then
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
it will come again come back again so
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
this is it's sort of the uh thank you

that drawer
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
now the uh on hearing days we will have
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%

00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
side there
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
however those bills those copies are
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
meant for the public who are in the
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
people who are attending uh the hearing
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're not really meant for you to say
 
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
oh well you know I'll just grab a copy
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
is if you have valuables and you want to
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
lock them away for the day the drawers
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
do have keys but make sure you do not
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%

if we have to evacuate the building we
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
will hear an alarm
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
and under no circumstances in an
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
emergency should we be using the
 
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.470 align:start position:0%
emergency should we be using the
elevators

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
elevators
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
if we have to shelter in place we would
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
be going to room 207 and 307 as
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
designated areas to wait for assistance
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
um or for those who cannot for some
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
members are to evacuate to a determined
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
place where the chair shall take head
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
count and ensure all members have exited
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
the building where has our collection
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
Point normally been in the past
 
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.930 align:start position:0%
Point normally been in the past
uh

00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
we haven't actually I I don't remember
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
do you remember uh so uh and it's not
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
something we ever practiced and and we
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
never had an emergency in my in the time
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
that I was here
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.169 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
since we exited to Green Street then uh
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
which is this one here right right yes
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
so uh then we should
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
um meet on on the opposite side of Green
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
Street roughly opposite the parking
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
garage yeah I believe that that's
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
actually I believe that that was the
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
place if I recall now yeah that was
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
um access to the building shall be
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
authorized by the Concord fire
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
department personnel and communicated
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
via Protective Services Chief in order
 
00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
to re-enter the building
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
in case of a medical emergency we would
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.409 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
and we would have to report what
 
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:04.580 align:start position:0%
happened the victim's name and condition
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
we have a AED devices located in the lob
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
Lobby in case we need them
 
00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:14.270 align:start position:0%
Lobby in case we need them
um

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
in case of something happening in the
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
room here of course we would want to
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
and not move the victim so and so forth
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
I'll let you read through this if you
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
um in in case of any kind of disturbance
 
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
in our meetings
 
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
we have a member that would
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
discreetly get help for us or or to
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
discreetly get help for us or or to
alert

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
alert
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
um our protective services staff to come
 
00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.490 align:start position:0%
um our protective services staff to come
and

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:51.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that the situation doesn't get
 
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have numbers listed here for
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
emergency After Hours the nurse's office
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
the end seat by the door is the
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee's emergency person
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
and basically it's like sitting in the
 
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:19.940 align:start position:0%
emergency room of the airplane
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
and our designated person is
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
for fire alarm exits we have a chart on
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
of the committee room that shows where
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
the exits are if you want to check that
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
out later on
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
so let's talk more about the the
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee our committee and what our
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
charge is and how we operate and
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
what our Protocols are
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
according to rule 31f
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
it is the duty of the committee on
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture to consider
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
all matters concerning Agricultural and
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
farm problems of the state physical land
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
use including current use
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
the various agricultural organizations
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
the protection of the state's
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
environment from forms of pollution
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
other than air or water pollution waste
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
management issues and such other matters
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
as may be referred to it
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that's our charge
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
and you will see by the collection of
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
bills that we've received so far
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
in terms of partisan balance
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm thrilled and proud that this
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
committee has always been run as a
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan committee
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I expect it to remain that way
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
we work together
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
we leave our party Federal party
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
National Party whatever party out at the
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
door and we work together
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
uh to solve these problems in the forms
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
of these bills that come to us
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
would you like to say a few words about
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
sure uh this so
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I've always valued
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
about this committee is that we are we
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
work in a non-partisan way uh almost all
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
the time there have been minor
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
exceptions once in a while but we are
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
have been very good about working in a
 
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan way and working together as
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
colleagues and
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty much been the way it's
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
been since even before I was here and
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
um I think that one of the things one of
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the Hallmarks of that is that uh last
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
term uh we with I think
 
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:44.900 align:start position:0%
two or three exceptions
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
all of our bills were on the consent
 
00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:48.490 align:start position:0%
all of our bills were on the consent
calendar

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:48.500 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
and uh and one of those that was was on
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar was wasn't on the
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
consent calendar was not on it simply
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
because it involved a large money amount
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it had been a unanimous or close to
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote uh and the way we do that
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
is not by just saying oh well we'll just
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
agree on everything it's we do the hard
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
work of figuring out how to get bills
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
that aren't ready to go uh into a
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
condition where we can all agree that
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
they are the best bills that we can get
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
out of committee and
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
sometimes that takes multiple passes and
 
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
it takes you know it takes some hard
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
work there are some bills where we'll
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
look at the bill and we'll say well you
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
know this obviously doesn't fit the the
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
needs or uh benefits of the State of New
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we'll just say no that's
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
not something that's going very far very
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
fast and there are some that we can look
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
at and say you know that is you know
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
obviously uh an important nuts and bolts
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
thing that we can just say good do it
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
but there are some bills where there are
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
complicated issues and we work hard on
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
trying to understand them and uh the
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
fact that there are 20 of us means we
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
have 20 different perspectives that we
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
can look at this from and uh things that
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
go through the process of discussion
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
with within the committee really get a
 
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.069 align:start position:0%
with within the committee really get a
better

00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
um hearing and a better analysis because
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
there are so many of us with different
 
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.349 align:start position:0%
there are so many of us with different
perspectives

00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh let's you know stick with that idea
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
that you know it we are here doing the
 
00:39:30.609 --> 00:39:30.619 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan work of this committee
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
partisan stuff stays outside the door
 
00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.849 align:start position:0%
partisan stuff stays outside the door
and

00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
um and let's you know work you know well
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have anything to add
 
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.849 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have anything to add
representative

00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:45.859 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think it's
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
important to note that this committee
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
deals with policy I think that's an
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
important distinguish uh distinguish
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
between some of the other committees but
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
we deal strictly with policy regarding
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:04.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
so some of the typical Bill topics we
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do with I'm not going to I'm not
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
going to say current use I haven't seen
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
a current use Bill and um since I've
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
been here
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
and this is my third term on this
 
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.170 align:start position:0%
and this is my third term on this
committee

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
solid waste recycling landfills product
 
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
of stewardship agricultural support and
 
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.849 align:start position:0%
of stewardship agricultural support and
promotion

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
Federal food safety modernization act
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
Farm stands pesticides Animal Welfare
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
both farm and household so those are the
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that we're going to see
 
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
come before us
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
now earlier I mentioned early Bills
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
going to Second committee we had three
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have bills that need to be
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
addressed quickly because they have to
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
go to another committee like Finance
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
and those bills get priority treatment
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
in order to get them in and out of our
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee quickly
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
we also have subcommittees
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
and the committee a subcommittee is just
 
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:15.380 align:start position:0%
a subset of this committee
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
and they further work on if we have a
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
bill that needs a little bit more
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
work and we don't have the time as a
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
full committee to to discuss it
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
we put that out to one of our four
 
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
we put that out to one of our four
subcommittees

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
we have an environmental policy commit
 
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.630 align:start position:0%
we have an environmental policy commit
subcommittee

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
an agricultural policy and current use
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee animal protection
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
and Licensing subcommittee and a solid
 
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
waste subcommittee I have some sign up
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
sheets here
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
I had asked you to think about
 
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.569 align:start position:0%
I had asked you to think about
um

00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
what subcommittee you'd like to be
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
working on
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going to pass this around and
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to put your name on it on
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
whichever subcommittee you'd like please
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
do that and I will collect that at the
 
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:17.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby could you explain a
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about the subcommittees and
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
and what goes in those sure
 
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.630 align:start position:0%
and what goes in those sure
um

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:28.849 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Policy subcommittee uh
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
environmental policy that primarily
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
um is land-based uh so that would have
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
to do with uh one one common uh sort of
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
Bill that would fall under that would be
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
bills having to do with pesticides uh
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
bills having to do with
 
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.470 align:start position:0%
bills having to do with
um

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
liking on other sort of uh do you
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
remember any other Environmental Policy
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
type bills that okay oh uh actually
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
there was we had a bill that had last
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
term that had to do with uh invasive
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
Upland invasive species that's something
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
that would fall into the Environmental
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
Policy subcommittee
 
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:15.380 align:start position:0%
um agricultural policy and current use
 
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
Uh current use almost I think I've seen
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
one current use Bill since I've been
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
here uh and that's looking at the
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
current the way the current use tax is
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
structured uh we probably won't see that
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
and agriculture policy we will certainly
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
see a number of those bills that could
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
be range from uh things having to do
 
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:38.660 align:start position:0%
with the definition of Agriculture and
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
agrotourism it could have to do with
 
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.150 align:start position:0%
agrotourism it could have to do with
um

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
Farms things having to do with Farm
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
stands things having to do with
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
homestead food production things having
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
um different regulations in the
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture having that
 
00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:00.619 align:start position:0%
have to do with Agriculture
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
I have I have a couple bills coming in
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh and yeah and then you know one can
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
sort of you know imagine there are
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a large range of
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
things that could fall under
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
agricultural policy uh animal protection
 
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.450 align:start position:0%
agricultural policy uh animal protection
um

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:29.099 align:start position:0%
one thing that we've done a fair amount
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
with is looking at uh how animal cruelty
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
investigations are dealt with and uh how
 
00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:39.500 align:start position:0%
the balance between is is struck between
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
the rights of the animals and the rights
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
of the owners and uh and how that and
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
um offshoots of that having to do with
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
how do we make sure that our disease
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
protection protocols in the state are
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
well founded but are reasonable
 
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.430 align:start position:0%
well founded but are reasonable
um and

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.349 align:start position:0%
um and
uh

00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
and things like you know if there were a
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill having to do with the cost of a dog
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
license it would it would go to that
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:17.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
and uh then Solid Waste uh is things
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
like recycling landfill regulation
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
um and composting and uh ways of
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
reducing solid waste and ways of helping
 
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh handle it more
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
effectively so are there any questions
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
um if you like many of these committees
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
are interesting to me do you I'm
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
assuming you want an even number of
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
people on all the subcommittees yes can
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
I put down so you you put down your name
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
on anyone that you're interested in and
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
at least two
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh and then
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Aaron and I will
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
look through the list and try to create
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
balance committees that are balanced in
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
a partisan way and uh and try to make
 
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that the people who
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
have get their first inter first and
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
second interests okay thank thank you uh
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
the other thing about subcommittees is
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
that only a small fraction of bills go
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee uh so last term I don't
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
think we had
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
any uh Environmental Policy bills that
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
actually went to subcommittee we had
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
several Solid Waste bills that went to a
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee one or two animal
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
protection bills that went to
 
00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:43.309 align:start position:0%
protection bills that went to
um subcommittee

00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
um subcommittee
 
00:46:43.319 --> 00:46:44.030 align:start position:0%
um subcommittee
um

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
so it kind of depends on what the bills
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
are and uh whether they look complicated
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
and need to be amended or whether they
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
don't look complicated and don't need
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment so uh
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
so that that's so um
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's pretty much uh the story
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
with the the subcommittees and
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
um we will uh representative air and I
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
will sort out the the lists and uh get
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
those out to you uh probably before at
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
and subcommittees
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
um they work pretty much the way the
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
regular larger committee works and so
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
far as they their meetings have to be
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
noticed to the public
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
there are minutes that have to be taken
 
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.670 align:start position:0%
there are minutes that have to be taken
um

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
they need to have a quorum
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
they also uh solicit information from
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
various agencies and
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
any anybody in the field who
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
can give them information to help them
 
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
work on the bill that they're working on
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
work on the bill that they're working on
[Music]

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.930 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
they make eventually you know the
 
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
purpose is for them to get together and
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the larger
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee on you know what
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
what should be done if there's an
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that needs to be done to the
 
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.430 align:start position:0%
amendment that needs to be done to the
bill

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
they work on that
 
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
they work on that
um

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittees will have chairs
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
and vice chairs just so it's just like
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
the larger committee
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so one other note
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
is that uh if the subcommittee is
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
working on a bill you don't happen to be
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
on that subcommittee but that but you
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
are interested in it you are welcome and
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
encouraged to attend those subcommittee
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
sessions uh the only thing is that when
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
it gets to a voting for recommendation
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
you don't get to vote uh but you can
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
activate act you can
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
um work in a fairly uh active way with
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee even if you're not on
 
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.890 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee even if you're not on
it

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and you just it's just that you
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay anybody have any questions oh
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah just for for those of you that have
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
not been on a subcommittee from my
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
perspective they're they're actually
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
pretty fun
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
because you really get into the details
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the state experts the
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
um different ngos the citizens that are
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with that bill and uh it's it's
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
where you can really get the meat of
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
compromise and figuring out second and
 
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
third order effects and um I just
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
encourage you to help out with the
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
subcommittees they're they're actually
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%

committee and they they go on top of the
letter

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
every time you all meet
 
00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:45.230 align:start position:0%
every time you all meet
ings

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
I don't tend to set name things up for
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
some committees because it's a small
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
informal the name plates only go out
 
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
the name plates stay here they don't go
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
and if you are substituting in another
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee sometime if you're asked to
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
substitute in another exec session for
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh you will
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
she really does make sure that the train
 
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
so I want to take this time to talk a
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more about our public
 
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.650 align:start position:0%
little bit more about our public
hearings

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.410 align:start position:0%
hearings
um

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
our public hearings really are the where
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
it all happens for us for in in our
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee in our committee work
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
because it is at that time where we can
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
truly hear from the public from agency
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
heads from lobbyists from all different
 
00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:20.870 align:start position:0%
heads from lobbyists from all different
people

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.770 align:start position:0%
people
um

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
based on their expertise their feelings
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
their observations their knowledge
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
whatever about a particular
 
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.290 align:start position:0%
whatever about a particular
um

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:35.540 align:start position:0%
issue that we're having to deal with in
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh in a with a bill with a piece of
 
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
uh in a with a bill with a piece of
legislation

00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
and you'd be surprised you know you you
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
something sounds pretty straightforward
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
but then somebody will come in and
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
throw a totally different
 
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
perspective on something and you just go
 
00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.099 align:start position:0%
wow I never even thought of that
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
so uh the committee hearings to me have
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
always been very fascinating because
 
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:06.020 align:start position:0%
they just bring to light
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
although what ifs uh all the different
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
situations that can happen if this bill
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
ever gets put into law
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
and I think we end up being better
 
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
legislators by listening
 
00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:22.069 align:start position:0%
legislators by listening
so

00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.210 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's a really great process and uh I'm
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
glad that we spend the time that we do
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
in the hearings uh listening to people
 
00:57:33.359 --> 00:57:34.430 align:start position:0%
in the hearings uh listening to people
uh

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
tell us why a piece of legislation is
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
either good or bad
 
00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:41.660 align:start position:0%
do you like to add anything to that
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
sure uh one of the things that's
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
important uh really important in public
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
hearings is uh is our decorum and the
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
way that we treat the people who are
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
testifying uh we all we must always be
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
respectful of the people who are
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
testifying and
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
um this is not an opportunity to grill
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
people it is a opportunity to elicit
 
00:58:11.099 --> 00:58:11.950 align:start position:0%
people it is a opportunity to elicit
information

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh so uh if you disagree with something
 
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
that a uh someone who's testifying is
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
saying you can ask for clarifying
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
information but you cannot say you're
 
00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
wrong and you cannot ask a question that
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
boils down to saying you're wrong you
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
need to uh you can you know ask someone
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
who is testifying later on to you know
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
say so you say person a is testifying
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
and says one thing and you're not sure
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
that that's actually correct and and
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
testify testifier B seems to be saying
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know taking a somewhat different
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
angle you can ask for clarify testifier
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
B for for clarification on something
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
that testifier a might have said that
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're not sure about that that is fair
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
as long as you do it in a respectful way
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is really
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
critical in this committee room and in
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
every every place that you meet the
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
public in the house and you meet your
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
fellow house members in the house is we
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
never impute motive we are looking for
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
facts we are looking for uh implications
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
of you know of policy we are not looking
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
we are not looking for motives if you
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
are saying if someone says that
 
00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.349 align:start position:0%
are saying if someone says that
um

00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
person a is doing this because they have
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
this ulterior agenda that is right out
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
oh I will gavel them I will hit that
 
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.710 align:start position:0%
oh I will gavel them I will hit that
gavel

00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
gavel
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
um so the it is is critical that we
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
always keep in mind that we are
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
respectful of the Republic of the public
 
00:59:59.569 --> 00:59:59.579 align:start position:0%
we are looking for as much information
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
as we can get out of them if it looks
 
01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
like they're if something has been said
 
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
a number of different times you don't
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
need to ask a question to elicit that
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
same information again uh but if there
 
01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:15.059 align:start position:0%
is an angle of it that doesn't doesn't
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
seem to have been covered then that is
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate so
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
we want to be as thorough as possible
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
without being particularly redundant
 
01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:27.289 align:start position:0%
without being particularly redundant
exactly

01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair and
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
when the public is testifying everything
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we do should be phrased in a form
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
of a question not a statement or an
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
opinion it should be an actual question
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
that we're asking them
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of formality that
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
question uh is channeled to the chair so
 
01:00:52.809 --> 01:00:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to give you that unwanted
 
01:00:58.930 --> 01:00:58.940 align:start position:0%
promotion I'm not I'm not ready for that
 
01:01:01.329 --> 01:01:01.339 align:start position:0%
chair Madam chair
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
um the chair will recognize you and uh
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
then you ask the ask your present your
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
question to uh the person who's
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
testifying but essentially the chair is
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
always the person who is
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
um who is do basically modified and
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
doing the traffic management right and
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
so if you ask
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
you asked to be recognized by the chair
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
the chair will give you permission to
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
ask your question if you have a second
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up question you must ask also
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
it is also we have to take into account
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
people take a day off from work to come
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
and testify many times we must value
 
01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:02.299 align:start position:0%
their time
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
we must respect that they're here and
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're heard and I want
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
that everybody is heard in an equal way
 
01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:17.930 align:start position:0%
that everybody is heard in an equal way
um

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
that also in terms of advocacy
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know people in the who who are
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
coming to testify May wear buttons or
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
stickers to show that they are
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
supportive of uh or not supportive of
 
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
something but we should not
 
01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:43.460 align:start position:0%
uh so we are here to listen and not to
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
be the ones
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
to show any kind of advocacy of any
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
particular Point representative Bixby
 
01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:51.950 align:start position:0%
particular Point representative Bixby
yeah

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
so just in terms of procedure uh for
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
members of the public who are here to
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
express an opinion on the bill there are
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
two ways they can do that actually three
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
ways they can do that uh at the front of
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
the um on the front desk there there
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
will be a blue sheet and there'll be
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
pink cards and the blue sheet is for
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
people who sign in who are not
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
interested in actually speaking uh the
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
pink cards are for people who would like
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak and those pink
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
cards are filled out and then brought up
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
to the chair and then the chair will
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
sort them roughly between people opposed
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
and people in favor of the bill people
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
who are so and uh the uh if and if other
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
reps are testifying or senators are
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
testifying they generally go to the
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
front of the queue so that they can get
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
back to their own committees
 
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.430 align:start position:0%
back to their own committees
um

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
if Department chairs are testifying or
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
or or or people from uh the
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
administrative departments they often
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
are near the front of the queue as well
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh and then there's an effort to make
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone else is uh sorted uh
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
in a in a fair manner uh there's a third
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
way that
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
um since the since 2020 there's a third
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
way to make a comment which is that
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's a sign in that is available
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
online uh where you can sign in in favor
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
or against a bill and uh which is
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
similar to the blue sheet except that
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's um it's online and at the end of
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
each hearing we say how many people
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
signed in in favor how many people
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
signed in against both from a blue sheet
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh is there going
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
to be any attempt during our session to
 
01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
encourage people to keep to a time limit
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
um you know if you have multiple people
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
from One organization to encourage them
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
to have a spokesperson rather than each
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you in a short short uh answer
 
01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.970 align:start position:0%
thank you in a short short uh answer
um

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of time limit I would have to
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
gauge that by how many people are in
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
attendance if we have a whole room full
 
01:05:37.329 --> 01:05:37.339 align:start position:0%
of people I would make it so that
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
everybody's equally heard but that you
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
know we don't have somebody speaking for
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
five minutes another speaking for 10
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
minutes and so I uh I'm gonna gauge that
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
on um you know attendance basically
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
I will likely if there is something
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
where there is a a whole lot of people
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
I don't want to hear the same thing over
 
01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
and over and over again
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
and I would also encourage them to have
 
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:12.980 align:start position:0%
a spokesperson to say
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
you know what it is they support or not
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.530 align:start position:0%
any other comments
oh

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton has that been
 
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.069 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton has that been
the

01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
where you've done it in your past
 
01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.430 align:start position:0%
where you've done it in your past
committee

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
yeah that that tracks
 
01:06:31.079 --> 01:06:31.910 align:start position:0%
yeah that that tracks
um

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
the big thing is to go through the chair
 
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.750 align:start position:0%
the big thing is to go through the chair
and

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.770 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
the one thing that that I've seen that
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
sort of drives me nuts um
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
is questions that go off track
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
in other words if if they're talking
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
about horses don't ask questions about
 
01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.450 align:start position:0%
about horses don't ask questions about
cows

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
cows
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
um I I've seen that go awry and you know
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I'd say okay thank
 
01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I'd say okay thank
you

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
I also want to talk about
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
um if there's a Committee Member on our
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
committee here who is also a sponsor or
 
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill which we have a
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:21.260 align:start position:0%
and that bill comes before the committee
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
of course the sponsor introduces the
 
01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
of course the sponsor introduces the
bill

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:28.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
but they can return to their seat after
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
testifying but if it now that's not
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
introducing a bill that's if they're
 
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
testifying on a bill okay so uh the uh
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
what we voted on last week yes was that
 
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.549 align:start position:0%
what we voted on last week yes was that
uh

01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
you uh if you you can either uh testify
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
or you can uh participate in questioning
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
but you cannot do both right and I
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
believe that that is for co-sponsors I
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
believe if it if you're the sponsor then
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
you basically you you can't ask you
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
don't have the option of asking
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions because you introduced the
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
bill and you're speaking right on behalf
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
of the bill right right okay but if you
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
are a co-sponsor and you are not
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
speaking on the bill at all you uh then
 
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to ask questions of
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
anybody else who's testifying on that
 
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.630 align:start position:0%
anybody else who's testifying on that
legislation

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
right okay everybody get that
 
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.189 align:start position:0%
right okay everybody get that
okay

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's how it's always been done pretty
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.239 --> 01:08:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
so anybody have any questions about Bill
 
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.849 align:start position:0%
so anybody have any questions about Bill
hearings

01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have one um
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
I was testifying it um for the last two
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
years a lot so there were some committee
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
chairs or that would run meetings and
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
give special
 
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.349 align:start position:0%
give special
um

01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
time for certain people and I just
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to see if that is going to happen
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
well for historically what we've done is
 
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
because we know people like Senators
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
have to run between
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh hearings and uh and their work
 
01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:22.580 align:start position:0%
we would give them the
 
01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak first that's fine
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and obviously the uh the person
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
who's introducing the bill they would
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
get first you know to speak
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I would give you know
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh
 
01:09:47.169 --> 01:09:47.179 align:start position:0%
uh you know special treatment to anybody
 
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
often Department chairs Department
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
chairs departments who know the subject
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
matter in detail are given a little bit
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
the only other the other thing is that
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh typically the the speakers will
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
alternate between pro and con so you
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
all the pros go once and then all the
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
cons go it's it's back and forth so you
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
get sort of a balanced view so normally
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know senators or agency heads that
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
have time commitments
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
you know we want to hear from them first
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
and also the agency heads that may have
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit more experience and
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
but for the most part I mean we're going
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
to try and be as Fair as possible in
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
terms of alternating pros and cons pink
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
cards and make sure people every
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
everybody gets the equal treatment
 
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.450 align:start position:0%
everybody gets the equal treatment
mm-hmm

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
yes

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
um just for everyone that's new to this
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee historically in this committee
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
we have been fair with everybody
 
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
um and no one gets preferential
 
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
treatment that I have seen uh since I've
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
so that's about our hearings
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
executive sessions so the executive
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
session is a time in which we gather
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
together as a committee
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we vote
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
on what we want to do with any
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
and we and render our committee
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation which will then obviously
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
go to the rest of the house
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
for them to decide whether we they agree
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the executive executive sessions are
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled just like the rest of any of
 
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
 
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.790 align:start position:0%
committee meetings
they

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
would list specific bills and but an
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
executive session can be held the same
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
day as the hearing on the bill
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
I guess that that's a decision that we
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
would come together to make right so uh
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
the uh there would only be an executive
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
session that uh if uh the chair and I uh
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
agree on uh that that that that should
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
happen and it is not something that we
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
would typically do unless I I think
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
unless there's a real deadline or unless
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
there is a a really obvious reason to do
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
it I if it's if it's a bill where the
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor comes up afterwards and says
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
oops I shouldn't have submitted this
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
please IPL it then we might do it that
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
at that point we actually had one of
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
those last term right but
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
um but we don't we don't want any
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
surprises right but one of the things
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
about executive sessions is that part of
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh part of what an exact an executive
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
session is something where stakeholders
 
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:06.980 align:start position:0%
will show up if they're interested in
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
and uh they may and we want to make sure
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
that stakeholders have the opportunity
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
to see that executive session noticed
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
and know that it's coming up so we'll
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
generally so we it we will we want to
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
avoid doing exacting bills the same day
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
unless there's a particularly good
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
reason to do it
 
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.189 align:start position:0%
reason to do it
exactly

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
any questions
no

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay um so the proceedings and motions
 
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
in an executive session
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the way the way that that works is
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
the chair opens the executive sessions
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
and makes sure that everybody knows that
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
it's an executive session
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
we uh the chair will recognize committee
 
01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
members for motions and a lot of times
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
those motions will be worked out ahead
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
of time so that you will know whether or
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
not you will be
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
um making a motion to on a pass or itl
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
something or do whatever else to it
 
01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:14.209 align:start position:0%
something or do whatever else to it
um

01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:16.460 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
then we after the motion has been made
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
we will have a discussion about
 
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.310 align:start position:0%
we will have a discussion about
uh

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
representative Kong
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair is it still going
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
to be the practice that whoever makes
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
the motion writes the blurb I'm going to
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
call it or committee report yes that
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
would be that is true that if you're
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion to Auto pass a
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
particular bill you are going to be the
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
one writing the committee report uh
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Creighton yeah so
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
the the committee report for those of
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
you that are are new
 
01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
um basically that's a short description
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
of why we voted a certain way
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
if it's a split decision then the
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
majority it goes first and then the
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
dissenting view goes second
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
typically that's put into the house
 
01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
typically that's put into the house
calendar

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
and so before you go to vote on it at in
 
01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's a clear understanding of what the
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
vote was in committee and the key
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
Salient points for why that vote was
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
taken and and
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen committee reports that go up
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
to two pages
 
01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
um but most of them are probably about
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
four or five lines
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to add something very
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
important about these committee reports
 
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
they are used in a court of law to
 
01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:53.420 align:start position:0%
record intent of what the legislation
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know was
 
01:15:59.630 --> 01:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
how the committee came to its
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
recommendation and
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
that it it reflects the intent of the
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
committee and so that's a very important
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
point to remember when you're writing a
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
and these committee reports are intended
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
to be clear and concise
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and and convey the reason why the
 
01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
committee made or came to its
 
01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.750 align:start position:0%
committee made or came to its
recommendation

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:28.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby another thing about
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
the committee report is that the
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
committee report gets
 
01:16:35.219 --> 01:16:36.050 align:start position:0%
committee report gets
um

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
gets submitted to chair Aaron and she
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
will review the committee report to make
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
sure that everything is in order and uh
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't look like it's in order
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
then she will contact you and uh work
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
out whatever needs to be Rewritten
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I will expect the committee reports
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
to be done before you leave the day of
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
the hearing of the executive session
 
01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.290 align:start position:0%
the hearing of the executive session
because

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
um all too often people say they're
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
going to write something and it ends up
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
being forgotten
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
um and and I I don't want
 
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:13.790 align:start position:0%
um and and I I don't want
um

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
people in other departments like Paul
 
01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:18.860 align:start position:0%
Smith yelling at me
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
so we're going to make sure that we get
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
our committee reports done when they
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.770 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
when we um
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
we will be voting for The Motions our
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
clerk will be the one to be in charge of
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
that so would you like to go through
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
that whole
 
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
that whole
protocol

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so when the
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
question is put a motion is made by a
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
member of this committee uh and whatever
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
that motion is
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
um it'll be recorded I will then call
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and everyone will say yes or no there
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
is no abstention
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
um you must vote yet yay or nay
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
um once that's done I will record the
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
vote tally and let you know if the
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
motion passed or failed
 
01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:16.970 align:start position:0%
motion passed or failed
um

01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
and that's about it and it's
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
can go pretty quickly so but the role
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
will be called in the same order every
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
single time so you'll get used to when
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
your name is going to be called
 
01:18:31.199 --> 01:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
your name is going to be called
um

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
um so one thing that uh if you haven't
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
been in a similar situation before uh
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
when you are voting you are voting on
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
the motion not on whether you like the
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill or not so uh if the motion for the
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill is itl or in expedient to legislate
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
then you are Mo your yes vote says that
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
bill should not go forward
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh and whereas if it's an ought to pass
 
01:19:04.729 --> 01:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
then your yes vote means that bill
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
I also I want to uh can you explain a
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
little bit too to everyone about
 
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
amendments and the order in which we do
 
01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.709 align:start position:0%
amendments and the order in which we do
that

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative oh Peter representative
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
Bixby go ahead okay so
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
um when there's an amendment to the bill
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing we do is we move we
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
move the bill itself and then uh the
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
chair will ask if there are any um if
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's any discussion and we'll also
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
say if is there any uh are there any
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendments and at that point an
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendment would be moved and then the
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
amendment gets voted on
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
and if the amendment passes then the
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
next vote uh would be an ought to pass
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
with Amendment and uh if the amendment
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass the next vote would be an
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
ought to pass uh and if that's uh and
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens with that then
 
01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:07.820 align:start position:0%
you know there are that could be further
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
complications uh we tend not to get into
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of further complications in
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee you'll see that happening a
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
lot on the floor
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
normally we only would have one
 
01:20:23.169 --> 01:20:23.179 align:start position:0%
Amendment on any particular Bill
 
01:20:26.649 --> 01:20:26.659 align:start position:0%
sometimes very rarely too
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
but we again we like to keep it very
 
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.410 align:start position:0%
but we again we like to keep it very
simple

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how that works for
 
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how that works for
voting

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
and the consent calendar
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
well upon completing our votes for a
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
um I will ask the committee if there's
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
any objection to placing a bill on the
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
consent calendar if we have a unanimous
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
decision or I think uh it's it's either
 
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
that or one dissension
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
any bill with more than two navotes will
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
and go ahead representative Murray sorry
 
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
I saw her first
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and the one
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
exception is that if it's over ten
 
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars then it automatically
 
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
has to go is that correct yes that is
 
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.030 align:start position:0%
has to go is that correct yes that is
true

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you madam chair
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
um there is an exception if there is one
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
nav out and they choose they say they
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
don't want it on consent calendar it
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
cannot go on consent correct
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative knob
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I just thought a question about the
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
changing the vote what's the process of
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
that like
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
so when the names have been called and
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
you voted
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
at what point would you if you wanted to
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
change your vote
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
it says you can change your vote before
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
the final vote is announced
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh ice I had uh heard that from our
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee researcher
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
but again no bills with any fiscal
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
impact or an appropriation above the
 
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
threshold of ten thousand dollars can be
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
a motion for reconsideration
 
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
a motion for reconsideration
um

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:32.780 align:start position:0%
would you explain that as well
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.590 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh there is a a vote is taken
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
on a bill and uh then more information
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
comes forward Before the bill goes to
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
the house the Full House and if the bill
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
is still in the possession of the
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee the committee has the ability
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
to vote to reconsider the bill
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
and uh and
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
the first vote on that would be simply a
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
vote for reconsideration so uh and if
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
the vote for reconsideration fails then
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
it just goes to the house floor the way
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we voted it first if the
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
reconsideration passes then it is open
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
to further discussion and further
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
motions uh and uh and then there'd be a
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
new vote in terms on the ought to pass
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
or the Ito
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
um and uh then that subsequent vote is
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
what would be sent to the house floor uh
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
there cannot be more than one
 
01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:38.540 align:start position:0%
reconsideration vote uh unlike in
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh on the house floor reconsideration is
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
not used as a way of sealing a vote so
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get changed right uh the in
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
in within committee it is it is really a
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
tool for if you get new information that
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
says you need to fix the bill then
 
01:23:58.620 --> 01:23:59.450 align:start position:0%
says you need to fix the bill then
um

01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's a chance to do that
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby I don't
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
believe I've ever seen that happen very
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
often anyway I think I've seen it like
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
maybe twice in six terms yeah
 
01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
and just a point of clarification the
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
only way you can move reconsideration is
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
if you voted on the prevailing or
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
Winning Side is that correct it's not in
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
committee yeah okay it says so here
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
oh it does not I'm sorry thank you
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
but on the floor that's the case yeah
 
01:24:38.169 --> 01:24:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.610 align:start position:0%
any questions
okay

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:42.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
moving along pretty good here
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
I will so we're pretty much done with um
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
with our executive session talking about
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
um meetings scheduling voting committee
 
01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:08.990 align:start position:0%
um meetings scheduling voting committee
reports

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
so we'll talk a little bit about field
 
01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
so we'll talk a little bit about field
trips

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
every so often uh yeah well again I know
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
you've been working on one I think uh
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
all right sure well every so often we
 
01:25:24.179 --> 01:25:25.130 align:start position:0%
all right sure well every so often we
will

01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
to have a field trip we go we go out and
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
we look at something that UNH extension
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
and wants to show us or we go out to
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
um a dairy farm or an apple orchard or
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know some place where we are going
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be educated about a particular topic
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
and they they we typically organize
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
farms uh and other related tours we will
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
give you notice and and hope that you
 
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
can join in
 
01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:57.470 align:start position:0%
can join in
um

01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
this committee these field trips are
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
designed to to help us get educated on
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
any particular issues
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
uh some of them may be organized by
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
groups like Farm Bureau
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
um some of them may be organized by our
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
agency heads
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
um depends
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
right now we're working on putting
 
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
together something so represent Bixby
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
why don't you talk about that so um one
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
thing that uh I've we tried to do last
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
year and it just didn't come together so
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it work this year is
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
on doing a tour at UNH uh that includes
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
looking at Co-op extension looking at
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
the uh the animal Diagnostic lab and
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
looking at and getting information from
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
people in colsa the College of
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and Life Sciences uh and so
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be working with Folks at
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
UNH to get that scheduled I think we're
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
looking probably at late April or early
 
01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:06.950 align:start position:0%
looking probably at late April or early
May

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
May
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh another uh thing that uh comes up
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
most years is uh the
 
01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:19.820 align:start position:0%
um uh the Farm Bureau has a uh
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
has a legislative breakfast which is
 
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
usually coordinated with their new
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
farmer program and often will happen at
 
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.870 align:start position:0%
farmer program and often will happen at
the

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the farm of their new farmer award
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
recipient and uh so we will have a
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
hosted breakfast and then get a chance
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
to tour the farm so that's something
 
01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:43.370 align:start position:0%
to tour the farm so that's something
that

01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
um typically I believe happens at some
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
point in April when it's a little bit
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
easier to trudge around the farm
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
so those are a couple of things to look
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
forward to and another
 
01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.229 align:start position:0%
forward to and another
um

01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
thing that sometimes comes up is if if
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
we're working on a particular Bill and
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
doing a field trip will uh be will give
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
us material knowledge in terms of uh how
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
that you know how we should proceed
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's another possibility so uh or and
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
another thing is there are sometimes
 
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
sort of stakeholders who are typically
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh have bills that might come before
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
this committee so a few years back we
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
did a tour of the turnkey landfill in
 
01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:33.020 align:start position:0%
Rochester and got to see their biogas
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
recapture program and um
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh so uh and there was an a number of
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
years back there was a
 
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:43.910 align:start position:0%
years back there was a
um

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
tour to the North country where we got
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
to see a farm stand that was uh looking
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
to have there was a bill that had to do
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
with some of the retail elements and uh
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
of how Farm stands work and we uh went
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
up to uh tour that farm and also toured
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
some other
 
01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
um interesting uh establishments uh in
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
the same on the same trip because you
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
know we were up there anyway so we would
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
had a chance to see a number of
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
different things so those are all
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
um potential things for for field trips
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
if if it looks like a field trip would
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
be useful for any of the bills that
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this term then we may
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
in fact try to schedule that too
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and also you get mileage for
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
those field trips yep
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
I know that one of the fun part was last
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
year when we had the raw milk
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
Bill Froze that was for frozen raw milk
 
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
and uh and I got a chance to go to The
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
Little Red Hen and Sample the raw milk
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:02.540 align:start position:0%
so other than field trips uh sometimes
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
we will have a special presentations by
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh different
 
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh different
organizations

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
so those would be
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so when maybe we're through with the
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
bulk of our bills
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opportunity to learn more
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
about any specific
 
01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:30.350 align:start position:0%
about any specific
um

01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
agency function I know we had a
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
presentation last year on invasive
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
aquatic species and it was very
 
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.950 align:start position:0%
aquatic species and it was very
fascinating

01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
fascinating
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
and they were very uh they were very
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
helpful and very thorough in their
 
01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.910 align:start position:0%
helpful and very thorough in their
presentation

01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions about
 
01:30:55.490 --> 01:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
we all ready to tackle these uh
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
16 bills that we have is six I think
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
and they look pretty reasonable I don't
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
see anything really out of uh out of the
 
01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
ordinary here
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
so um I am going to try and sit down and
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out a schedule for when the
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
hearings for these will be we will try
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
and group them as to like
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of bills like we have a couple
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
having to do with uh Homestead food
 
01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.350 align:start position:0%
having to do with uh Homestead food
operations

01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
and then others that have to do with um
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
landfill stuff and
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll we'll have to sit down
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to put this together
 
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
so that it makes sense and that we don't
 
01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
so that it makes sense and that we don't
have

01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh you know Miss Moss of things to deal
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
and uh so we will be
 
01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.350 align:start position:0%
and uh so we will be
um

01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%

01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
like we've we've flashed through
 
01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.169 align:start position:0%

01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
directly related to these particular
 
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
groups so it's important to hear what

good afternoon everybody welcome back to
 
03:02:23.090 --> 03:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
environment agriculture committee I hope

hope you filled your belly
 
03:02:33.050 --> 03:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
I would like to take this opportunity to
 
03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
welcome members of the Department of
 
03:02:39.410 --> 03:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
Agriculture farms and markets and I will
 
03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
turn this over to our esteemed
 
03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:44.210 align:start position:0%

commissioner

03:02:44.210 --> 03:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner

03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
my pleasure to be here
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
um certainly see a lot of new faces and
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
so we're going to give you a
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
presentation that really delves into
 
03:03:01.610 --> 03:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
what we do in terms probably more
 
03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
numbers so you get the scale of what the
 
03:03:06.130 --> 03:03:06.140 align:start position:0%
department does
 
03:03:10.130 --> 03:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are uh freshman
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
members of the House
 
03:03:14.090 --> 03:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
I hope this was one of your top three
 
03:03:15.889 --> 03:03:15.899 align:start position:0%
committees because I have to tell you
 
03:03:17.630 --> 03:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
that when I was elected to the house in
 
03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:19.790 align:start position:0%
that when I was elected to the house in
1984

03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
1984
 
03:03:22.330 --> 03:03:22.340 align:start position:0%
environment AG was my first choice
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal encounty was my second I don't
 
03:03:26.809 --> 03:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
recall my third and I ended up on
 
03:03:26.819 --> 03:03:28.910 align:start position:0%
recall my third and I ended up on
judiciary

03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
judiciary
 
03:03:31.969 --> 03:03:31.979 align:start position:0%
which turned out to be very well uh a
 
03:03:33.530 --> 03:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
good thing but I never did end up on
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture so a little
 
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
special for me to now be the
 
03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:39.110 align:start position:0%
special for me to now be the
commissioner

03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:40.250 align:start position:0%
commissioner
so

03:03:40.250 --> 03:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:40.260 --> 03:03:41.210 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:03:41.210 --> 03:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:44.210 --> 03:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
largely the Department of Agriculture is
 
03:03:46.490 --> 03:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
about consumer protection
 
03:03:50.570 --> 03:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
most everything that we try to do is to
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
protect the people of the State of New
 
03:03:54.349 --> 03:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in one way or another I won't
 
03:03:56.750 --> 03:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
delve into that the folks behind me Will
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
and rather that's being you know
 
03:04:01.550 --> 03:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
protected from disease or invasive
 
03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
species or people who would try to uh
 
03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
under deliver the product they're
 
03:04:12.650 --> 03:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
selling you whether that's uh meat by
 
03:04:14.450 --> 03:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
weight or cord wood or any of those
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
things we do that a lot of people get
 
03:04:18.769 --> 03:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
confused and think that that we do the
 
03:04:18.779 --> 03:04:20.030 align:start position:0%
confused and think that that we do the
education

03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
we don't that's Cooperative Extension
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
UNH I really do consider them to be our
 
03:04:28.849 --> 03:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
sister organization we partner with them
 
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
constantly and they do a great job of
 
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
educating and they make life a lot
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
easier for all of us so I'm just going
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
to get into a little bit of the overview
 
03:04:41.690 --> 03:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:04:43.730 --> 03:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:44.269 align:start position:0%
our budget
um

03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature so
 
03:04:49.910 --> 03:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
the Department's budget
 
03:04:52.319 --> 03:04:52.910 align:start position:0%
the Department's budget
um

03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
is about 7.6 million dollars
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
and our request moving forward uh
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
depending on whether you're looking at
 
03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget or our total
 
03:05:04.020 --> 03:05:05.630 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget or our total
request

03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:05:05.640 --> 03:05:06.469 align:start position:0%
request
um

03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
can range up as high as 8.8
 
03:05:14.090 --> 03:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
the good thing about what we do is
 
03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
taking away the things that are sort of
 
03:05:19.250 --> 03:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh you know funding land preservation
 
03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
funding the fares if you look at our
 
03:05:23.870 --> 03:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
operations our people in our direct
 
03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:25.370 align:start position:0%
operations our people in our direct
expenditures

03:05:25.370 --> 03:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
03:05:28.010 --> 03:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
we are actually a revenue positive
 
03:05:28.020 --> 03:05:29.330 align:start position:0%
we are actually a revenue positive
agency

03:05:29.330 --> 03:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
we bring in somewhere between two two
 
03:05:34.570 --> 03:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to a million
 
03:05:38.330 --> 03:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
more than than we expect I'm very proud
 
03:05:40.070 --> 03:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
of that and I want to make sure we stay
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
that way I'm a fiscal conservative and I
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
I like to see that fact that we are
 
03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
actually not a drain on the general fund
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
so money goes back and forth we keep
 
03:05:53.090 --> 03:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
some in some funds some go back into the
 
03:05:54.410 --> 03:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
general fund then we get general fund
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
but when you balance it all out we
 
03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
maintain every year uh being Revenue
 
03:06:00.420 --> 03:06:01.550 align:start position:0%
maintain every year uh being Revenue
positive

03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
positive
 
03:06:03.230 --> 03:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there's too many
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
agencies that that can say that out
 
03:06:07.849 --> 03:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
there besides liquor probably but
 
03:06:07.859 --> 03:06:08.450 align:start position:0%
there besides liquor probably but
um

03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:10.570 --> 03:06:10.580 align:start position:0%
that's a whole nother
 
03:06:13.070 --> 03:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:06:16.190 --> 03:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
um 42 full-time
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
um excuse yeah we have 42 full-time
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
employees right now
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
um it's up from 36 when I became
 
03:06:24.420 --> 03:06:25.969 align:start position:0%
um it's up from 36 when I became
commissioner

03:06:25.969 --> 03:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:06:28.490 --> 03:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
39 maybe I guess we had a number of
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
vacancies the years are going by it's
 
03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
getting harder to remember what those
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
numbers were we have a request uh for
 
03:06:38.690 --> 03:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
really converting one part-time person
 
03:06:41.929 --> 03:06:41.939 align:start position:0%
to full-time it's not actually within
 
03:06:43.550 --> 03:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
the department that's administratively
 
03:06:46.010 --> 03:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
attached that is the state Conservation
 
03:06:46.020 --> 03:06:47.690 align:start position:0%
attached that is the state Conservation
Commission

03:06:47.690 --> 03:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
um the last budget we were able to
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
finally get a part-time executive
 
03:06:54.290 --> 03:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
director in there it's made the world of
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
difference in the world of State
 
03:06:59.690 --> 03:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
conservation and um moving that person
 
03:07:02.809 --> 03:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
to a full-time Position will also make a
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
huge difference so far the government
 
03:07:07.010 --> 03:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
Governor has been supportive of that the
 
03:07:09.410 --> 03:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
other priority that I have has been the
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
priority I really had since
 
03:07:14.809 --> 03:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
um I became Commissioners understanding
 
03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
the department that large
 
03:07:20.510 --> 03:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's me now Dr Crawford is my
 
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
Deputy but he's busier than I am so it's
 
03:07:26.809 --> 03:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
not like he he's just there if I'm away
 
03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
on vacation he's the authority he's not
 
03:07:32.090 --> 03:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
you know sharing in that workload
 
03:07:34.849 --> 03:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
because his workload and his division is
 
03:07:38.570 --> 03:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
now even higher than than mine quite
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
frankly but he does have it assistant uh
 
03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
State veterinarian now
 
03:07:46.190 --> 03:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so I am looking for an assistant
 
03:07:46.200 --> 03:07:48.650 align:start position:0%
um so I am looking for an assistant
commissioner

03:07:48.650 --> 03:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:07:50.769 --> 03:07:50.779 align:start position:0%
um you know I rarely leave the office
 
03:07:53.330 --> 03:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
for more than a couple of days at a time
 
03:07:55.070 --> 03:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
because the paperwork piles up and
 
03:07:59.330 --> 03:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's nobody there to do that and we I
 
03:08:01.550 --> 03:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunity to do the
 
03:08:03.170 --> 03:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
strategic planning that I really ought
 
03:08:03.180 --> 03:08:04.849 align:start position:0%
strategic planning that I really ought
to

03:08:04.849 --> 03:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
um when I became commissioner we did
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
take on fisma which is the food safety
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
modernization act from Health and Human
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
Services that has proven to be very
 
03:08:17.570 --> 03:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
successful that's a totally federally
 
03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
funded program and we have just got when
 
03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
we took it over there was a full-time
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
position there I couldn't figure out
 
03:08:25.130 --> 03:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
what a full-time person would be doing
 
03:08:27.469 --> 03:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
at that stage so we went with part-time
 
03:08:30.830 --> 03:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
people now it is time to move back to
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
having a full-time person there because
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the program is growing it's it's one of
 
03:08:37.610 --> 03:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
these that is staged based on the sales
 
03:08:40.490 --> 03:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
of a farm and it keeps well going at a
 
03:08:42.410 --> 03:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
very low level to a higher level and
 
03:08:45.410 --> 03:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
we're moving up along that that chain
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm very proud of the work that we
 
03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
do in the Department of Agriculture and
 
03:08:53.290 --> 03:08:53.300 align:start position:0%
I think we are a very efficient
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
organization you'll hear about what we
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
do when we do you know an awful lot of
 
03:09:01.730 --> 03:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
work with very few people but I could
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
not even begin to do it without the
 
03:09:06.849 --> 03:09:06.859 align:start position:0%
fantastic team that I have here
 
03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
behind me some of them have been with
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
the department for many many years and
 
03:09:16.210 --> 03:09:16.220 align:start position:0%
uh three are relatively new directors
 
03:09:18.290 --> 03:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
one having already been with the
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
department for a while and others coming
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
on and they are all just doing a
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
fantastic job for the State of New
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I couldn't be prouder of the
 
03:09:30.230 --> 03:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
people who serve as the directors of the
 
03:09:34.130 --> 03:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
department and the staff who serves in
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
each of their divisions
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
what we hope to do here is give you that
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
overview I'd like to put questions any
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions off to the end we'll all
 
03:09:44.570 --> 03:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
remain to be able to answer them but I
 
03:09:46.250 --> 03:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to take away from any of
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
their their time
 
03:09:50.510 --> 03:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
and so I'll be here for for questions as
 
03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:51.650 align:start position:0%

uh Steve Crawford I'm the state
veterinarian

03:10:25.490 --> 03:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
03:10:27.650 --> 03:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
the director of the division of animal
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
industry and as you heard from the
 
03:10:31.490 --> 03:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner the Deputy Commissioner in
 
03:10:33.170 --> 03:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
his absence
 
03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:34.670 align:start position:0%
his absence
um

03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:36.769 --> 03:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
I've been trying for 17 and a half years
 
03:10:38.929 --> 03:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
how to distill
 
03:10:41.090 --> 03:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
what the what the division does into an
 
03:10:42.650 --> 03:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
elevator speech and I have not figured
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
that out yet
 
03:10:46.610 --> 03:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm going to take a little
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
different tact today for the intro
 
03:10:49.849 --> 03:10:49.859 align:start position:0%
meeting and maybe focus on some of the
 
03:10:51.290 --> 03:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
numbers it'll it'll sort of address what
 
03:10:52.190 --> 03:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
we do but it'll give you numbers
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
attached to them just sort of a instead
 
03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
of a concept or a theory
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
PIRA should I be using this for the
 
03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:00.710 align:start position:0%
PIRA should I be using this for the
computer

03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:02.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:11:02.929 --> 03:11:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.849 --> 03:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
oh look at that all right
 
03:11:06.889 --> 03:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh Department Mission here just because
 
03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
I think it's useful to sort of frame
 
03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:12.290 align:start position:0%
I think it's useful to sort of frame
everything

03:11:12.290 --> 03:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:13.730 --> 03:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
General functions of the department
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
promoting and regulating Agriculture and
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
pay close attention to that sixth one
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
other duties as assigned
 
03:11:22.730 --> 03:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
animal industry seems to have a lot of
 
03:11:24.230 --> 03:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
those and I'm guessing other divisions
 
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
do as well
 
03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
the definition of agriculture oh you're
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.690 --> 03:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
our division Mission so this why the
 
03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
division of animal industry exists
 
03:11:36.290 --> 03:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
controlling contagious and infectious
 
03:11:36.300 --> 03:11:37.610 align:start position:0%
controlling contagious and infectious
diseases

03:11:37.610 --> 03:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
03:11:39.170 --> 03:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
in particular those ones that can affect
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
humans and I apologize I'm trying to
 
03:11:41.690 --> 03:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
make eye contact but missing somebody
 
03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
around the the implements here
 
03:11:46.969 --> 03:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
protecting public health and the economy
 
03:11:48.889 --> 03:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
and the environment frankly now and as
 
03:11:50.690 --> 03:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
we look forward at one Health and more
 
03:11:52.730 --> 03:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
modern approach and then our animal
 
03:11:54.170 --> 03:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
population control program that we'll
 
03:11:59.230 --> 03:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.370 --> 03:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize this was animated I'm
 
03:12:01.380 --> 03:12:02.210 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize this was animated I'm
sorry

03:12:02.210 --> 03:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:12:04.010 --> 03:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
a little slower than I thought so
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
estimates of the numbers of animals in
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
avma demographics some USDA censuses and
 
03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
some other places where we've pulled
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
these together from
 
03:12:16.130 --> 03:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
that one in the top right because of the
 
03:12:17.950 --> 03:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing High path Haven influenza
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
outbreak I thought was useful to
 
03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:21.050 align:start position:0%
outbreak I thought was useful to
highlight

03:12:21.050 --> 03:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
03:12:24.230 --> 03:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
that one is based on a 2004 USDA census
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
a backyard vlogs
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
dated data but I would challenge anybody
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
here to drive down two or three dirt
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
roads in the state and not see a cooler
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
or a sign for eggs somewhere
 
03:12:36.110 --> 03:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
my guess is those numbers have gone up
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
since 2004. but 34 000 backyard flocks
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.570 --> 03:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis testing
 
03:12:51.230 --> 03:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
so we need to statistically to get 4 900
 
03:12:53.630 --> 03:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
some animals tested cattle tested each
 
03:12:56.090 --> 03:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
year to maintain our free status that
 
03:12:57.769 --> 03:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
gives our producers lots of latitude to
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
move animals back and forth across state
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
lines to slaughter without extra
 
03:13:03.250 --> 03:13:03.260 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden
 
03:13:05.710 --> 03:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
2021 the last complete year
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
2260 of those through Slaughter
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
we tested ourselves 1639 so we're still
 
03:13:15.170 --> 03:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's a new england-wide mou or memo
 
03:13:20.090 --> 03:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
that USDA acknowledges that lets us use
 
03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
other states data to maintain our status
 
03:13:24.170 --> 03:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
they put up a rhetorical question for
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
you there do you find are you do you
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
find comfort in that using other states
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
data to maintain our status
 
03:13:31.309 --> 03:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we would get the other
 
03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
thousand we just don't have the time or
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bodies but it some of the things
 
03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
that we deal with Interstate movement
 
03:13:38.690 --> 03:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
documents thousands of those that we've
 
03:13:40.969 --> 03:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
verify review each year
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
little rabies is largely a local
 
03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
responsibility but we deal with over 300
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
calls a year questions from local
 
03:13:48.110 --> 03:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
authorities who don't know the details
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions from veterinarians questions
 
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
from people who are bitten by dogs or
 
03:13:52.550 --> 03:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
cats and want to know the details of
 
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
03:13:56.330 --> 03:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
many dozens of quarantines poultry
 
03:13:58.070 --> 03:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
places other livestock each year that we
 
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
try and manage
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
in a fairly new thing that is necessary
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
but becomes sort of a challenge
 
03:14:07.070 --> 03:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
lots of small poultry flags that end up
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
with disease don't want those birds
 
03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:09.950 align:start position:0%
with disease don't want those birds
anymore

03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:14:11.929 --> 03:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
we are now a euthanasia surface for a
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
lot of those small flock owners because
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
they have no other option
 
03:14:16.490 --> 03:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
and so we work with our wildlife
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
services folks we have a trailer that we
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
use with carbon dioxide to euthanize
 
03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
birth we do a fair amount of that never
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
something I even envisioned as part of
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
the Department's job but there's nowhere
 
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
else to get that done and I think it's
 
03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
an important thing for Disease Control
 
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
and Animal Welfare to figure out how to
 
03:14:32.450 --> 03:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
do it if we don't do it
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh I am the the state's lead for
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
emergency support Function 11 to the
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
state Emergency Operations plan that is
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture cultural and natural
 
03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
resources it's not just agriculture so
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm responsible for helping dncr Des
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
fish and game and others sort of
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
mitigate plan for the disasters that
 
03:14:54.769 --> 03:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
might affect them as well
 
03:14:57.230 --> 03:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings lots of planning stuff
 
03:14:58.610 --> 03:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
goes into that
 
03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh I hold
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
Devin by my account up there DEA
 
03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:05.330 align:start position:0%
Devin by my account up there DEA
registrations

03:15:05.330 --> 03:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
I hold one for my office we don't have
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
any drugs there
 
03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
we need to keep that though in case we
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
needed them for an emergency I hold five
 
03:15:14.750 --> 03:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
for state fish and game because you have
 
03:15:17.330 --> 03:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
to be a veterinarian or an MD to hold
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
the DEA registration and fishing game
 
03:15:20.750 --> 03:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a veterinarian on staff
 
03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
I hold one for each of their field sites
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
and one for their headquarters and I
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
also hold one for USDA wildlife services
 
03:15:28.849 --> 03:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I'm responsible for the risks that go
 
03:15:30.650 --> 03:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
along with that and annual Audits and
 
03:15:33.170 --> 03:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
some other stuff Pharmacy boards
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
actually coming to my office tomorrow
 
03:15:36.170 --> 03:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to destroy all the stuff that
 
03:15:37.309 --> 03:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
I've collected from them in the last
 
03:15:38.929 --> 03:15:38.939 align:start position:0%
year that's outdated from the last
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
thought so it's something that we do for
 
03:15:42.349 --> 03:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
them on a regular basis
 
03:15:45.050 --> 03:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
working off a lot with HHS Fish and Game
 
03:15:47.269 --> 03:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security who has been fantastic
 
03:15:49.610 --> 03:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
to us frankly during the uh
 
03:15:51.950 --> 03:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
High path AI outbreak they have built an
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
online mapping tool that we can use when
 
03:15:56.090 --> 03:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
we plot a location of a farm that might
 
03:15:57.769 --> 03:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
be infected it will automatically show
 
03:15:59.690 --> 03:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
us the 10 kilometer 20 kilometer circles
 
03:16:01.730 --> 03:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
and the places that we need to contact
 
03:16:03.410 --> 03:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
so they've been wonderful to help us
 
03:16:05.090 --> 03:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
with that it's not I.T capacity that we
 
03:16:07.010 --> 03:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
have ourselves and going through
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets is not the way to do that
 
03:16:10.250 --> 03:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
anymore either
 
03:16:10.260 --> 03:16:12.469 align:start position:0%
anymore either
uh

03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:15.290 --> 03:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
deal with several cases per month with
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Animal Welfare stuff
 
03:16:19.309 --> 03:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
we're working up one now with the town
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh calls weekly but actively on farms
 
03:16:25.130 --> 03:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
with police at least a couple times a
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
month to deal with Animal Welfare cases
 
03:16:30.290 --> 03:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
the poultry numbers I thought were
 
03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
interesting fairly consistent uh Little
 
03:16:35.330 --> 03:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
Drop in the first year of the pandemic
 
03:16:37.130 --> 03:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
and a bump in the next couple of years
 
03:16:40.010 --> 03:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
lots of people wanted Birds
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
the 9-3 those are the import documents
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
for poultry and I thought that was
 
03:16:44.279 --> 03:16:45.650 align:start position:0%
for poultry and I thought that was
useful

03:16:45.650 --> 03:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
useful
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
approaching 300 000 Birds imported
 
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
last year to individuals and feed stores
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's not our big poultry players
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's just the individual folks and
 
03:16:56.929 --> 03:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
that's for who we have records I would
 
03:16:58.849 --> 03:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
bet you there are plenty that we don't
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
3 200 New Hampshire residents individual
 
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents that imported
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
Birds last year
 
03:17:07.309 --> 03:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
and then our livestock dealers which is
 
03:17:09.290 --> 03:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
largely our poultry stores are pardon me
 
03:17:10.849 --> 03:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
our feed stores that sell poultry
 
03:17:13.130 --> 03:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
imported about 80 000 Birds themselves
 
03:17:16.610 --> 03:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
or 90 000 Birds pardon me uh
 
03:17:18.170 --> 03:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have to have an initial State
 
03:17:20.269 --> 03:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
response and containment plan in order
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
for any of our poultry producers that
 
03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
are affected by hypothetic qualify for
 
03:17:26.750 --> 03:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
Indemnity we submitted that a couple of
 
03:17:29.210 --> 03:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
years ago to USD USDA for approval and
 
03:17:30.769 --> 03:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
they haven't approved it yet they've
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
been busy with the high path AI stuff
 
03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
and they've also paid our producers so
 
03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
far so I think we're okay but getting
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
some of the planning stuff done like the
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner said finding time to do the
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
office work is a challenge
 
03:17:43.490 --> 03:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh we do regular testing for four New
 
03:17:44.990 --> 03:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire poultry Farms that ship to
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
slaughter in New Jersey because they're
 
03:17:48.530 --> 03:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
they required that testing
 
03:17:50.450 --> 03:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
we don't have any veterinarians in New
 
03:17:51.769 --> 03:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire outside of our department that
 
03:17:53.929 --> 03:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
are comfortable doing that testing so
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 15 on-site visits last
 
03:17:58.610 --> 03:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
year to those Farms so they could send
 
03:18:01.010 --> 03:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 500 to 1500 birds at a
 
03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
time down for Slaughter
 
03:18:05.570 --> 03:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
these are not poultry specific Farms but
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
these are all people who are farming for
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
a living no off farm jobs and they
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
together they employ 40-ish I think when
 
03:18:13.250 --> 03:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
I did the numbers 40 people that these
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
four small farms are employing keeping
 
03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
hundreds of Acres open if we don't
 
03:18:18.230 --> 03:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
provide that service for them they don't
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
have the poultry piece of their business
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh other duties as assigned so the
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
biggest single consumer of our people
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
resources is regulating the pet trade
 
03:18:33.410 --> 03:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
not agriculture but it's our single
 
03:18:35.150 --> 03:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
biggest people consumer
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
a little over three fdes to deal with
 
03:18:40.670 --> 03:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
that and just 150 license holders
 
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's an enormous task
 
03:18:44.450 --> 03:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:18:48.530 --> 03:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's a challenging group to deal with
 
03:18:48.540 --> 03:18:49.370 align:start position:0%
it's a challenging group to deal with
um

03:18:49.370 --> 03:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:53.090 --> 03:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
it it is it is it's a challenging group
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of the revenue generation
 
03:19:01.250 --> 03:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral 200 license for the year
 
03:19:04.429 --> 03:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
we license 150. so 30 000 ish dollars
 
03:19:06.290 --> 03:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
you would generate
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
we spend three ftes worth of time and
 
03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
salary on that plus fuel and other stuff
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a revenue neutral thing I don't
 
03:19:15.290 --> 03:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
know how it would be uh and I'm not
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it should be necessarily
 
03:19:17.929 --> 03:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
but that's that's one of those things
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I will likely be in front of you
 
03:19:20.809 --> 03:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
more often for pet vending than for
 
03:19:22.370 --> 03:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and I work for the Department of
 
03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:25.969 align:start position:0%
and I work for the Department of
Agriculture

03:19:25.969 --> 03:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
Agriculture
 
03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
our spay and neuter plan our program
 
03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
pardon me first in the country
 
03:19:32.929 --> 03:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
established in 1994. about 5 000
 
03:19:35.450 --> 03:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
applications a year from mean means
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
based residents of New Hampshire
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
I want their dogs or cats spayed or
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
neutered five thousand applications a
 
03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:42.590 align:start position:0%
neutered five thousand applications a
year

03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
at just five minutes to review each of
 
03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
those for content and accuracy that's
 
03:19:48.230 --> 03:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
three months of Staff time just to
 
03:19:49.969 --> 03:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
review the application not the processor
 
03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
to do anything else
 
03:19:55.130 --> 03:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh database RFP update I was actually
 
03:20:00.230 --> 03:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
asked about it when I came in so last
 
03:20:00.240 --> 03:20:01.450 align:start position:0%
asked about it when I came in so last
year

03:20:01.450 --> 03:20:01.460 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:20:04.730 --> 03:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
we thanks to your assistance we got the
 
03:20:08.030 --> 03:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
authority and funding to establish
 
03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
an electronic database for records
 
03:20:10.020 --> 03:20:11.570 align:start position:0%
an electronic database for records
management

03:20:11.570 --> 03:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
we need to get into the 2000s
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh many months later the state is slow
 
03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
I signed off on the final approval of
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
RFP yesterday and commissioner Goulet
 
03:20:25.010 --> 03:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
signed off on it today so by the end of
 
03:20:27.290 --> 03:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
the week our RFP will be posted it will
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
be open for 60 days I believe
 
03:20:33.769 --> 03:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh at which point we will review all the
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
applications with a team from oit and
 
03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
from our department and from the
 
03:20:40.010 --> 03:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
03:20:43.250 --> 03:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
in my our timeline was by July 1st to
 
03:20:45.889 --> 03:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
have someone chosen for a contract we're
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
about we wanted to have the RFP posted
 
03:20:50.090 --> 03:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
December 31st so we're 10 days to two
 
03:20:52.010 --> 03:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
weeks behind so still hoping for July
 
03:20:54.889 --> 03:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
1st to get that contract signed it still
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
sort of stays in line with what the
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
statute established for us last year as
 
03:20:59.570 --> 03:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
a timeline
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh High path Avon influenza outbreak
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about in the news
 
03:21:05.809 --> 03:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to go over time I can
 
03:21:08.510 --> 03:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
stop any let me see
 
03:21:10.490 --> 03:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's probably time for me to wrap it up
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
so ongoing High path they have an
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
influenza outbreak we have had two
 
03:21:16.429 --> 03:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
backyard flocks affected
 
03:21:19.370 --> 03:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
that has had implications for all four
 
03:21:20.570 --> 03:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
of those flocks I told you about that
 
03:21:21.889 --> 03:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
shipped to New Jersey because we have to
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
change testing and movement status and
 
03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
for some of our big poultry players
 
03:21:27.170 --> 03:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
because this is no longer just about
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
disease it's about politics with other
 
03:21:31.730 --> 03:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
countries and other states so
 
03:21:34.130 --> 03:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
even though we've only had
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
folks that aren't part of the
 
03:21:36.650 --> 03:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
traditional industry affected it has
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
affected more than a handful of other
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
farms in the state it's a real deal
 
03:21:40.680 --> 03:21:41.690 align:start position:0%
farms in the state it's a real deal
issue

03:21:41.690 --> 03:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:21:43.969 --> 03:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
uh plenty more for there to there for
 
03:21:44.809 --> 03:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
you to read I'll be here for questions
 
03:21:46.730 --> 03:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
and you guys can all find me by phone or
 
03:21:48.410 --> 03:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
email or walking across the street
 
03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you well do you want me to let you
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.929 --> 03:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon honorable members of the
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm David Russo I'm the director of
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
division of pesticide control so thanks
 
03:22:10.190 --> 03:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
for serving for the citizens of the
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
the images that um that we use to in
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
this presentation today shows some
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
important pieces to
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
pesticide concerns in regards to
 
03:22:25.969 --> 03:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
protection of human health in the
 
03:22:27.410 --> 03:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
environment and and this is actually
 
03:22:30.050 --> 03:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
current images we're using with training
 
03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
that we do the commissioner mentioned
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension we do partner with
 
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
them on training individuals that are
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
interested in getting a license and I'll
 
03:22:40.610 --> 03:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
explain uh when you'd need a pesticide
 
03:22:42.889 --> 03:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
license or individuals that already hold
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
a license that need to do continuing
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
education requirement commitments so we
 
03:22:50.990 --> 03:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
have a strong focus on the importance of
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that message protecting human health and
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
the environment in regards to pesticide
 
03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:56.510 align:start position:0%
the environment in regards to pesticide
control

03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:22:59.330 --> 03:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh the statute does allow for pesticide
 
03:23:02.210 --> 03:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
use as long as pesticides are used in a
 
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
proper and inappropriate manner so the
 
03:23:06.410 --> 03:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
statute does allow for use in in the
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
division's mission is really to make
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
sure that that that's the way things are
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
actually going on in reality
 
03:23:16.370 --> 03:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
um and the way we do that is this five
 
03:23:18.410 --> 03:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
program areas we have licensing and that
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
that all has to do with exams and
 
03:23:26.929 --> 03:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
we have an enforcement section within
 
03:23:31.610 --> 03:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
the division and we do have inspectors
 
03:23:32.929 --> 03:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
that go out make sure that folks that
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
hold licenses they're actually doing
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
things the way they're supposed to be
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
doing we also respond to complaints
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's a product registration piece the
 
03:23:42.650 --> 03:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
statute requires that any product
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
pesticide product that sold and
 
03:23:46.130 --> 03:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
distributed in the state of New
 
03:23:48.110 --> 03:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is registered with the state
 
03:23:50.809 --> 03:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
so we we're just register um pesticide
 
03:23:50.819 --> 03:23:52.429 align:start position:0%
so we we're just register um pesticide
products

03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
products
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
we do have an Environmental Protection
 
03:23:58.550 --> 03:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and an integrated Pest Management
 
03:24:01.610 --> 03:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
program so those are the five major
 
03:24:04.250 --> 03:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
areas so integrated Pest Management uh
 
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
for folks not familiar with it is a a
 
03:24:08.450 --> 03:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
concept some folks will call it a
 
03:24:10.010 --> 03:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
science or an art but it's really an
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
approach to a pest that doesn't just
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
identify pesticide as the as the reason
 
03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh response so integrated Pest
 
03:24:18.710 --> 03:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
Management is including other things
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
like mechanical control Behavior
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
cultural and and that sort of thing so
 
03:24:25.490 --> 03:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
those are the five major areas within
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
the division of pesticide control as far
 
03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
as numbers go is our deliberables
 
03:24:32.929 --> 03:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
deliverables from um from 2022 last year
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
we issued 2 600 licenses so folks that
 
03:24:38.090 --> 03:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
needed a pesticide license we had 2 600
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
of those the number of products
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:49.370 --> 03:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
um inspections we did 600 inspections
 
03:24:51.769 --> 03:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
and we issue a special premise a special
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
permit goes above and beyond holding a
 
03:24:56.210 --> 03:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
license and these are usually required
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
in sensitive areas like nearby water
 
03:25:01.190 --> 03:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
resources and the environmental section
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
within our division reviews those
 
03:25:04.849 --> 03:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
requests for use of pesticides in those
 
03:25:07.610 --> 03:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas so we did 360 of those
 
03:25:09.889 --> 03:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
um a point I wanted to make about
 
03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
product registration the manufacturers
 
03:25:15.050 --> 03:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
of products they have to register it
 
03:25:16.969 --> 03:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
with the state and the the fee that they
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
pay goes to the integrated Pest
 
03:25:21.170 --> 03:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
Management program and that supports
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
some of the division as well as grants
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
so the Staffing how we do this we have
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh one individual that's the
 
03:25:33.410 --> 03:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
administrator that would be me the
 
03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
director a certification coordinator
 
03:25:36.889 --> 03:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
that's the person that makes sure that
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
people um are licensed properly that
 
03:25:41.090 --> 03:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
they go through the examination process
 
03:25:44.090 --> 03:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
that they renew their licenses on time
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
we have the Environmental Protection
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
Program manager
 
03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
and one individual that reads views I
 
03:25:52.190 --> 03:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 600 inspections that we do
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
this this position this enforcement
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
worker protection manager reviews each
 
03:25:58.250 --> 03:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
one of those cases to determine the
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
proper enforcement action whether it's
 
03:26:01.490 --> 03:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
just a field notice or it might be a
 
03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:03.170 align:start position:0%
just a field notice or it might be a
fine

03:26:03.170 --> 03:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
fine
 
03:26:04.969 --> 03:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
and then we have two inspectors to cover
 
03:26:06.530 --> 03:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
the whole state
 
03:26:08.330 --> 03:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
the nice thing with the state of New
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire inspect is they don't just
 
03:26:12.349 --> 03:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
qualify for the state standard they also
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
hold Federal credentials for pesticide
 
03:26:16.250 --> 03:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
inspections so they they hold a dual
 
03:26:20.929 --> 03:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
and then we have an individual that
 
03:26:25.010 --> 03:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
oversees those registration of the 13
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
000 pesticide products
 
03:26:29.630 --> 03:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
and yesterday I had an interview for a
 
03:26:30.769 --> 03:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
product assistant that's the only one
 
03:26:31.910 --> 03:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're missing right now and hopefully
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have that that position filled and
 
03:26:36.050 --> 03:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
that position rotates among the
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
different programs just as an assistant
 
03:26:40.190 --> 03:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
sort of piece so that's the Staffing
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
piece we have eight individuals
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
for the five major programs I'm going to
 
03:26:47.630 --> 03:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
mention some major topics one of them we
 
03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
may see is a bill we've seen it as a
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
legislative service request and that's a
 
03:26:54.889 --> 03:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
a ban on a certain class of rodenticides
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so so I guess you'll be hearing more
 
03:26:58.490 --> 03:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
from me on that the division does not
 
03:27:00.290 --> 03:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
support a ban there's a great concern
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
with with rodents particularly rats and
 
03:27:04.729 --> 03:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
mice but we'll go into detail when we
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
when we cover the bill but that's one of
 
03:27:07.849 --> 03:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
the major topics we're involved with
 
03:27:10.370 --> 03:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
um training we do uh partner with a uni
 
03:27:14.929 --> 03:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
particularly the University of New
 
03:27:16.729 --> 03:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but actually any trade group
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
that comes to the division and requests
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
the speaker especially in regards to
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
what the regulations mean and and
 
03:27:23.570 --> 03:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
offering assistance compliance
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
assistance we do we do uh Outreach and
 
03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:27.469 align:start position:0%
assistance we do we do uh Outreach and
training

03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
um that's a major topic another major
 
03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
topic is the abavaral disease in regard
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
to mosquitoes and some of the diseases
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
that they carry such as West Nile Virus
 
03:27:36.769 --> 03:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
Eastern equine Encephalitis and we work
 
03:27:38.809 --> 03:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
close with the division uh with the
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health and Human
 
03:27:39.899 --> 03:27:41.269 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health and Human
Services

03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:27:43.309 --> 03:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
and an integrated Pest Management we're
 
03:27:44.690 --> 03:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to keep that in
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
people's minds that the response to a
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
pest doesn't always need to be a
 
03:27:50.809 --> 03:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
chemical so that's a continuing major
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
project and the federal government has a
 
03:27:55.070 --> 03:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
a piece regarded to agriculture it's
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
called worker protection and this is
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much Farms that use workers and
 
03:28:00.410 --> 03:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
the worker protection standard is so
 
03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
that the farmers the owners are reaching
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
out to make sure that those workers
 
03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:04.690 align:start position:0%
out to make sure that those workers
understand

03:28:04.690 --> 03:28:04.700 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:28:07.370 --> 03:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
pesticides and precautions to take so
 
03:28:09.769 --> 03:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
that that limit exposure so those are
 
03:28:11.570 --> 03:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
our major some of our major topics we do
 
03:28:13.490 --> 03:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
get involved with a lot of other topics
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
as well I wanted to mention some of our
 
03:28:17.690 --> 03:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
government Partners again we work
 
03:28:19.250 --> 03:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
closely with the University of New
 
03:28:21.530 --> 03:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on training and research we
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
work closely with department
 
03:28:24.410 --> 03:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
environmental services especially water
 
03:28:26.809 --> 03:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
quality pieces Health and Human Services
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that with the mosquito we
 
03:28:30.889 --> 03:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
also had a project for Health and Human
 
03:28:32.690 --> 03:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
Services on ticks a couple years ago in
 
03:28:36.050 --> 03:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
regards to Lyme disease we do we are
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
supported by some federal money through
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
the United States Environmental
 
03:28:40.729 --> 03:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency so we work closely
 
03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
with the with vpa
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
and Fish and Wildlife and right now the
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
most current fish and wildlife project
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're working on is the is the tracking
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
of animals that have been identified as
 
03:28:54.410 --> 03:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
having residue from rodenticides so
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's a really important piece right
 
03:28:55.800 --> 03:28:57.950 align:start position:0%
that's a really important piece right
now

03:28:57.950 --> 03:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:28:59.330 --> 03:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
so those are some of our Partnerships
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to leave the last
 
03:29:02.389 --> 03:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
three slides and this is really digging
 
03:29:03.530 --> 03:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the weeds but I always I always
 
03:29:05.690 --> 03:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this because from where you
 
03:29:07.370 --> 03:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
sit you may not know the standard that
 
03:29:09.410 --> 03:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
someone would have to go through for a
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
license or a permit but there is an exam
 
03:29:13.370 --> 03:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
requirement okay and it's a high
 
03:29:13.380 --> 03:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
requirement okay and it's a high
standard

03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:15.950 align:start position:0%
standard
um

03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
and there's two types of pesticide
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
applicators one is commercial some that
 
03:29:21.650 --> 03:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
might be someone that that we may hire
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
to come to the house to deal with
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
cockroaches or or the lawn and then
 
03:29:27.410 --> 03:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
there's private which is more of the
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
agriculture based uh individual but the
 
03:29:32.990 --> 03:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
exam is um it's written okay and it's
 
03:29:34.729 --> 03:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
closed book
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
um for commercial pesticide license if
 
03:29:38.330 --> 03:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
you go on someone else's property and
 
03:29:40.370 --> 03:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
you use a pesticide you need a pesticide
 
03:29:42.530 --> 03:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
license so
 
03:29:45.229 --> 03:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
um that exam is three parts we have core
 
03:29:46.849 --> 03:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
which is your basic pesticide
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
information on safety how to read a
 
03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
label the category focuses is on on
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
focuses in on the site that you're
 
03:29:55.130 --> 03:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
working at so we have 23 different types
 
03:29:56.450 --> 03:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
of categories for example if you're
 
03:29:58.490 --> 03:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
working just in lawns that would be the
 
03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
turf category and we have a separate
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
category for for example structural
 
03:30:04.250 --> 03:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with termites and that sort of
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing so you have the koi category and
 
03:30:08.809 --> 03:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
then a regulations portion of the exam
 
03:30:11.570 --> 03:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
now there's a advanced level required
 
03:30:13.250 --> 03:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
for every company
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
and it's called the supervisory level
 
03:30:16.250 --> 03:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
license and that's not just the written
 
03:30:17.870 --> 03:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
exam but they come in for an oral exam
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
and they have to pass the written to
 
03:30:22.250 --> 03:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
take the oral and the um oral exam is
 
03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
like an interview and we asked that
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
individual questions we usually like to
 
03:30:28.969 --> 03:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
have a a panel of three people one a
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert a regulation
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
expert and then a generalist so that's a
 
03:30:35.210 --> 03:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
commercial license that's the exam
 
03:30:36.889 --> 03:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
requirement and then the private which
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
is really the agricultural type permit
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
we refer to all them as licenses but
 
03:30:43.570 --> 03:30:43.580 align:start position:0%
this is actually technically a permit
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
anyone using pesticides in the
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
production of a commodity for sale or
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
distribution has to have a a permit and
 
03:30:52.729 --> 03:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
again it's three-part three-part exam I
 
03:30:53.809 --> 03:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave you with that just so
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
when we do talk
 
03:30:56.450 --> 03:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
um in regards to bills that you
 
03:30:57.830 --> 03:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
understand the person that holds a
 
03:30:59.450 --> 03:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
license that does it professionally
 
03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
that's the um the standard they're held
 
03:31:03.950 --> 03:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
to so that's all I have and thank you
 
03:31:05.690 --> 03:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Paris siegert
 
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'm the state entomologist and I'm the
 
03:31:28.190 --> 03:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
director of the division of plant
 
03:31:28.200 --> 03:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
director of the division of plant
industry

03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to start with just a few
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
numbers here and so well first our
 
03:31:38.030 --> 03:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
mission is to promote and protect plant
 
03:31:40.250 --> 03:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
Health by curtailing the spread of
 
03:31:42.290 --> 03:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
dangerous insects diseases and weeds
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
moved in Commerce
 
03:31:44.399 --> 03:31:45.950 align:start position:0%
moved in Commerce
um

03:31:45.950 --> 03:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:47.929 --> 03:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
there can be sometimes I think a little
 
03:31:51.170 --> 03:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
bit of unclarity uh between what we do
 
03:31:53.090 --> 03:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
versus what division of force and lands
 
03:31:54.950 --> 03:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
does versus what Cooperative Extension
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
does and we partner with all of those
 
03:31:58.190 --> 03:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
organizations and I hope in my next
 
03:32:00.290 --> 03:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
slide to kind of try to highlight a
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
little bit where what we do is distinct
 
03:32:05.690 --> 03:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
from what they do we have four full-time
 
03:32:08.929 --> 03:32:08.939 align:start position:0%
Personnel we have my position as a state
 
03:32:10.849 --> 03:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
entomologist we have two entomologist
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
twos and one entomologist one and we
 
03:32:16.809 --> 03:32:16.819 align:start position:0%
have one part-time apiary inspector
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
our funding from General funds is just
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
over four hundred thousand dollars we
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
get a little bit under two hundred
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in federal grants and
 
03:32:27.670 --> 03:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to vary from year to year
 
03:32:31.729 --> 03:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
and then last year the Upland invasive
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
species remediation fund was created and
 
03:32:37.210 --> 03:32:37.220 align:start position:0%
that's a cost share fund for treatment
 
03:32:40.250 --> 03:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
using herbicides for invasive species
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
um so if you look at our website which I
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
have listed there and which is on the
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
handout that has gone out to you I
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
prepare a report every year on the
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
activities of the previous year the
 
03:32:55.130 --> 03:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
report that's up there right now is
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
2021's report
 
03:33:00.170 --> 03:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll start working on 2022's report
 
03:33:03.050 --> 03:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
pretty soon and I think also handed out
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
to you or being handed out to you is
 
03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
basically a front and back page summary
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
of that 28-page report
 
03:33:11.150 --> 03:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
um so anytime you want to look and see
 
03:33:13.130 --> 03:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
what we're doing it's there in a lot of
 
03:33:13.140 --> 03:33:14.929 align:start position:0%
what we're doing it's there in a lot of
detail

03:33:14.929 --> 03:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
detail
 
03:33:17.929 --> 03:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
so we can't do this job alone we have a
 
03:33:20.090 --> 03:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
lot of Partners in terms of our plant
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
protection framework it goes from the
 
03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
state level which was what we do here at
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh to the between state
 
03:33:30.830 --> 03:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
level harmonizing regulations through
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
the national plant board uh the federal
 
03:33:35.929 --> 03:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
level which is uh USDA animal plant
 
03:33:37.250 --> 03:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
health inspection service plant
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
protection and quarantine afis PPQ the
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
Continental level which is the National
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
North American Plant Protection
 
03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
Organization which is comprised of
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
Canada the United States and Mexico and
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
then the International Plant protection
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
convention which is 211 countries that
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
are trying to harmonize plant pest rules
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
in order to reduce the transfer of pass
 
03:34:03.050 --> 03:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
across borders while still promoting
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
trade and plants and plant parts so we
 
03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
have a network of folks that we're
 
03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
trying to work with at every single
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
level to reduce the spread of pests and
 
03:34:13.849 --> 03:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
then we have a lot of non-regulatory
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
Partners and Cooperators years only some
 
03:34:17.690 --> 03:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
of whom I have listed here because I
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
knew I was going to run out of space on
 
03:34:21.050 --> 03:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
if I look at plant protection activities
 
03:34:25.370 --> 03:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
there's Continuum of activities with
 
03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
invasion of plant pests so plant pests
 
03:34:29.210 --> 03:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
can be insects it can be pathogens they
 
03:34:32.510 --> 03:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
can be weeds etc etc first you have you
 
03:34:34.490 --> 03:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
know pre-detection you have don't have
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
the plant pest in that area then you
 
03:34:38.210 --> 03:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
move into the early detection phase
 
03:34:39.710 --> 03:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
where something has been introduced but
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's not widespread yet and then you get
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the point where it's established a
 
03:34:45.469 --> 03:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
lot of our activities actually are
 
03:34:47.570 --> 03:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
happening in the before and early stage
 
03:34:49.849 --> 03:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
we don't do management and that's where
 
03:34:51.050 --> 03:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
you're going to get into like division
 
03:34:52.429 --> 03:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
of force and lands may do more
 
03:34:54.769 --> 03:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
management when you have an agricultural
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
pest on that is in somebody's field they
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
might look to Cooperative Extension to
 
03:35:01.610 --> 03:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
give them some guidance we don't offer
 
03:35:03.530 --> 03:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
that kind of guidance and so we have
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
different activities and tools that we
 
03:35:07.370 --> 03:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
use depending on what stage of invasion
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
you are by a plant pest some of them we
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
do throughout we're going to license
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
plant dealers regardless of whether or
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
not they there are plant pests in the
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
area we're going to do inspections to
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that plants being offered for
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
sale are apparently free of plant pests
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
and we're going to do certification and
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
compliance activity so that if they want
 
03:35:26.570 --> 03:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
to ship to another state even though we
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
have Japanese beetle in New Hampshire we
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
can certify and comply your plant
 
03:35:31.790 --> 03:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
shipment so we can go to Oregon where
 
03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
they don't want Japanese beetle so we do
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
that regardless of the stage of the
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
infestation then there are some
 
03:35:39.170 --> 03:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
activities that we don't do once a pest
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
becomes established once a pest is
 
03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
established my division does not survey
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
once a pest is established my division
 
03:35:47.690 --> 03:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
really kind of backs off a lot on the
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
Outreach and education that we do that
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
gets taken over by other entities that's
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
going to be your extension your division
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
of forests and lands and then quarantine
 
03:35:58.010 --> 03:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
is a tool in the toolbox that is used
 
03:36:00.650 --> 03:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes exterior quarantines are those
 
03:36:00.660 --> 03:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
sometimes exterior quarantines are those
that

03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
work to reduce the likelihood of a pest
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
coming into the state so we're going to
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
use an exterior quarantine when there's
 
03:36:09.769 --> 03:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
a pest nearby that we don't want an
 
03:36:11.929 --> 03:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
interior quarantine is where you're
 
03:36:13.490 --> 03:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
trying to either control the movement of
 
03:36:16.370 --> 03:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
the pest within the state or if there is
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
a commercial and economic reason to
 
03:36:20.690 --> 03:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
continue maintaining a quarantine in
 
03:36:22.969 --> 03:36:22.979 align:start position:0%
order to ship to other places we'll use
 
03:36:25.130 --> 03:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
an internal quarantine
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
so plant dealers this is I always
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
describe this as kind of our bread and
 
03:36:31.250 --> 03:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
butter there's nothing like a live plant
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
for moving a live plant pest their food
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
source is moving with them so we do a
 
03:36:38.690 --> 03:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
lot of regulations of of plant dealers
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
and so we work with the green industry
 
03:36:42.290 --> 03:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
to facilitate trade and protect the
 
03:36:44.170 --> 03:36:44.180 align:start position:0%
public through surveys and inspection
 
03:36:47.809 --> 03:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
beekeeping we have a part-time apiary
 
03:36:50.929 --> 03:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
inspector and we maintain an apiary and
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
provide assistance to New Hampshire's
 
03:36:54.050 --> 03:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
beekeeping industry this is a very small
 
03:36:54.060 --> 03:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
beekeeping industry this is a very small
program

03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:36:56.690 --> 03:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
and then the wood products industry
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
since the 1970s there's been a big
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of introduced
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
pests into this country that have moved
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
in Wood Products
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and so depending on the past we will
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
work with the producers of firewood logs
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
Lumber chips
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
um all sorts of crazy things end up in
 
03:37:14.929 --> 03:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
this wood products
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of commodity stream there
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
including like rabbit chew toys little
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
things in pet stores will end up
 
03:37:23.809 --> 03:37:23.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to deal with because
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's found a plant past in them
 
03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
so some of these activities we have 917
 
03:37:32.929 --> 03:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
licensed plant dealers in 2022 and 660
 
03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
different entities have registered their
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
Apiaries at some point we do not have a
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism for removing Apiaries from
 
03:37:41.690 --> 03:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
that list so this is up to date this is
 
03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
how many have have asked to be
 
03:37:43.380 --> 03:37:44.990 align:start position:0%
how many have have asked to be
registered

03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
registered
 
03:37:46.849 --> 03:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
um last year we did 580 Nursery
 
03:37:50.330 --> 03:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
inspections we did 33 apiary inspector
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
consults where they call on the phone
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the apiary inspector can actually
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
resolve a lot of these through emails
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
photos phone calls eight of them
 
03:38:01.370 --> 03:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
required him to go to the location to to
 
03:38:04.570 --> 03:38:04.580 align:start position:0%
do a further inspection and the USDA
 
03:38:09.050 --> 03:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
issues permits for various insects or
 
03:38:11.450 --> 03:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
soils that come into the come into the
 
03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
state and I have to approve those so we
 
03:38:16.450 --> 03:38:16.460 align:start position:0%
did 142 of those
 
03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
we issued 20 compliance agreements for
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
for producers to say that they meet
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
certain requirements to facilitate
 
03:38:25.570 --> 03:38:25.580 align:start position:0%
shipping to other locations we issued
 
03:38:28.729 --> 03:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
183 phytosanitary certificates to move
 
03:38:31.969 --> 03:38:31.979 align:start position:0%
mostly plants to other states that have
 
03:38:33.410 --> 03:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
a requirement for that level of
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
certification we issued 14 phytosanitary
 
03:38:38.929 --> 03:38:38.939 align:start position:0%
certificates to ship plans to Belgium
 
03:38:41.210 --> 03:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
Canada France Netherlands Poland and the
 
03:38:44.210 --> 03:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
UK and all of that comes with a suite of
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have to review and
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
then specific activities that we have to
 
03:38:50.090 --> 03:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
do to make sure that those plants are in
 
03:38:51.469 --> 03:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
compliance with their import
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
requirements Diaz Cole Growers is the
 
03:38:56.690 --> 03:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
only Greenhouse in the country that is
 
03:38:59.389 --> 03:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
dually certified under the greenhouse
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
certification program which is a trade
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
agreement between Canada and the U.S as
 
03:39:06.349 --> 03:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
well as the voluntary sank systems
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
approach to Nursery certification
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
program they've really led the way on
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
that I believe that we got DS coal
 
03:39:15.889 --> 03:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
Growers finally certified under the gcp
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
at the start third of 2020 and since
 
03:39:20.330 --> 03:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
that time they've had a 63 percent
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of shipments that
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
they've sent to Canada I don't want to
 
03:39:25.250 --> 03:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
say that that's solely because of being
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
in the gcp there's probably a lot of
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
other factors also that have led to that
 
03:39:31.130 --> 03:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
but it certainly has made it easier for
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
them to certify their own shipments to
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
Canada under that program we certify
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
firewood kelens seven of them in the
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
state that are shipping their firewood
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
to states with a regulatory strategy so
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
if the state says we need firewood
 
03:39:46.250 --> 03:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
certified to this heat treatment level
 
03:39:48.170 --> 03:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
to enter our state we have certified
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
those Kilns to do so this is our
 
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
actually our certification period for
 
03:39:54.110 --> 03:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
firewood uh kiln's right now so we just
 
03:39:56.090 --> 03:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
got our probes yesterday and are
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
starting to go around the state today to
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
to certify those Kilns which is an
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
annual activity we partner with Growers
 
03:40:07.090 --> 03:40:07.100 align:start position:0%
for pest survey and Export certification
 
03:40:10.250 --> 03:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
we reach a diverse audience via many
 
03:40:12.170 --> 03:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
means and often partner with extension
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
on events the more eyes that are out
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
there looking for insects and other
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
plant pests the easier our jobs are so
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
we see this as a core function
 
03:40:23.450 --> 03:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
our invasive species program so in
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
addition to our rules we provide
 
03:40:27.290 --> 03:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
trainings and information on eradicating
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
invasive plants we cooperate on
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
management and demonstration projects
 
03:40:35.330 --> 03:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so last year as I mentioned there was
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the Upland invasive
 
03:40:39.530 --> 03:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
species remediation Fund in the creation
 
03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the Upland invasive species
 
03:40:42.410 --> 03:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
coordinator position those were
 
03:40:45.530 --> 03:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
highlights to date with these
 
03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
demonstration projects that we're
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
involved with we've treated 161 Acres of
 
03:40:53.290 --> 03:40:53.300 align:start position:0%
Japanese knotweed and right-of-ways
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
26.5 Acres done with Woody foliar
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
treatments about 38 000 spot treatments
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
of Woody invasive plants and we've been
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
managed about just under 5 000 tree of
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
heaven so just a moment here to to point
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
out a couple of things that on our
 
03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
website we have this New Hampshire guide
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
to Upland invasive species as well as
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
the manual preventing the spread of
 
03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
Japanese knotweed these are both really
 
03:41:19.969 --> 03:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
popular for people they like to they
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
like to look at these the Japanese
 
03:41:24.410 --> 03:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
knotweed manual has been distributed to
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
all of the dot districts for use as well
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
as every municipality received one for
 
03:41:30.670 --> 03:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
when they're doing land moving projects
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire guide to Upland
 
03:41:35.210 --> 03:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
invasive species gets distributed
 
03:41:36.769 --> 03:41:36.779 align:start position:0%
everywhere people request it pretty
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
regularly tree of Heaven is a preferred
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
host for spotted lanternfly which is a
 
03:41:45.410 --> 03:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
pest which is uh kills grapes and and is
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
likely to cause some regulatory concerns
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
if it becomes established in New
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it doesn't need tree of Heaven
 
03:41:54.170 --> 03:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
to survive but it grows faster and
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
leaves more offspring if it can feed on
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
tree of heaven so reducing tree of
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
Heaven does reduce the likelihood of
 
03:42:03.530 --> 03:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
establishment of spotted lanternfly
 
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
we surveyed for 26 different pests that
 
03:42:08.450 --> 03:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
are considered of risk to New Hampshire
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and the environment which
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
are not established in the state last
 
03:42:13.790 --> 03:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
year this year we're on task to survey
 
03:42:16.969 --> 03:42:16.979 align:start position:0%
for 32. we did 31 tick identifications
 
03:42:19.330 --> 03:42:19.340 align:start position:0%
where folks sent in ticks for us to ID
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
28 identifications of insects and
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
spiders and then we had two likely
 
03:42:26.889 --> 03:42:26.899 align:start position:0%
delusional parasitosis
 
03:42:28.969 --> 03:42:28.979 align:start position:0%
situations which I'm not going to go
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
into in too much detail but if you want
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
to talk to me about it at some point I'd
 
03:42:33.469 --> 03:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to describe what that
 
03:42:33.479 --> 03:42:34.370 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to describe what that
is

03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:42:36.530 --> 03:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
so our challenge is always our budget
 
03:42:38.889 --> 03:42:38.899 align:start position:0%
Personnel we do a lot for four people
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
online retailers is kind of the Wild
 
03:42:43.610 --> 03:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
Wild West in terms of what's happening
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of people moving plants around
 
03:42:47.090 --> 03:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
and whether people are in compliance or
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
not that's um true in every single state
 
03:42:51.650 --> 03:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
and we're all struggling to understand
 
03:42:53.150 --> 03:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
how to really fit them into the
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
framework and then anytime we have
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
impacts to our federal Partners that's a
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
line of protection that isn't there
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
anymore that we then kind of take up the
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
slack on and so so what's happening to
 
03:43:04.729 --> 03:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
our federal Partners is important to us
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have a variety of different websites
 
03:43:09.710 --> 03:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
our division website nhbugs which is a
 
03:43:12.410 --> 03:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
multi-agency cooperation has a lot of
 
03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
information primarily about Forest pests
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
there's an active Facebook page with
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
that and I think that's it happy to
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.130 --> 03:43:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.170 --> 03:43:41.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:44.330 --> 03:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my name is Cheryl air I'm
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
the director of weights and measures
 
03:43:48.530 --> 03:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I am one of the new ones that has not
 
03:43:51.010 --> 03:43:51.020 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee thus far
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
I became the director in 2019 but I have
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
been with the division since 2006.
 
03:44:00.370 --> 03:44:00.380 align:start position:0%
um the Division of Weights and measures
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
is a really really important division
 
03:44:05.450 --> 03:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people don't even know
 
03:44:08.570 --> 03:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
about John Quincy Adams said weights and
 
03:44:10.010 --> 03:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
measures may be ranked among the
 
03:44:11.809 --> 03:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
necessaries of life to every individual
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
of human society and I 100 percent
 
03:44:16.969 --> 03:44:16.979 align:start position:0%
believe this statement weights and
 
03:44:16.979 --> 03:44:17.809 align:start position:0%
believe this statement weights and
measures

03:44:17.809 --> 03:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
measures
 
03:44:20.330 --> 03:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
affects each one of you every single day
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
whether you're driving your car buying
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
fuel whether you're buying food whether
 
03:44:26.929 --> 03:44:26.939 align:start position:0%
you're buying packages from the grocery
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
store for your dog food or buying your
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
pesticides all of those have a weight or
 
03:44:35.150 --> 03:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
measure on them as a declaration of what
 
03:44:38.570 --> 03:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
you are purchasing so we do
 
03:44:38.580 --> 03:44:41.269 align:start position:0%
you are purchasing so we do
um

03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.490 --> 03:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
we do touch everybody's life every
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
single day
 
03:44:47.090 --> 03:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
the Division of Weights and measures
 
03:44:49.190 --> 03:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
mission statement
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
um is not necessarily just about
 
03:44:53.450 --> 03:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
consumer protection it is about equity
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace because those
 
03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
businesses where we are buying products
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
from those business owners are consumers
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
as well but they're also
 
03:45:05.929 --> 03:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
um in direct competition to the other
 
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
businesses just like them and so as we
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
look at equity in the market we are
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
looking to make sure that we as
 
03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:16.279 align:start position:0%
individuals are getting
 
03:45:16.279 --> 03:45:17.830 align:start position:0%
individuals are getting
fairly

03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
03:45:17.840 --> 03:45:19.450 align:start position:0%
fairly
fair

03:45:19.450 --> 03:45:19.460 align:start position:0%
fair
 
03:45:23.690 --> 03:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
prices and product given to us but also
 
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that the businesses are are
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
successful because they are competing
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
with each other as well and so we want
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are abiding by
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
the laws and regulations so that it is
 
03:45:38.450 --> 03:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
in our um our staff we have seven
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
full-time staff members and we have one
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
part-time staff member
 
03:45:48.530 --> 03:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I oversee the whole weights and
 
03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
measures program a lot of it is
 
03:45:50.279 --> 03:45:52.010 align:start position:0%
measures program a lot of it is
Administrative

03:45:52.010 --> 03:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
Administrative
 
03:45:52.020 --> 03:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
Administrative
um

03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
communicating with different individuals
 
03:45:58.849 --> 03:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
and businesses when violations are
 
03:45:58.859 --> 03:46:01.309 align:start position:0%
and businesses when violations are
um

03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.190 --> 03:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
are had we have a program specialist who
 
03:46:05.929 --> 03:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
oversees all of our service technicians
 
03:46:08.090 --> 03:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
and way Masters she's the one that
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
answers the general line and takes
 
03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints which we get a fair
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
amount of we have a program assistant
 
03:46:16.370 --> 03:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
who oversees all the businesses that are
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
licensed and those businesses are ones
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
that have weighing and measuring devices
 
03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
that they use commercially we have a
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
metrologist now
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
um our Metrology lab houses all of our
 
03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'll show another slide about the
 
03:46:32.330 --> 03:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
Metrology lab in a little bit but
 
03:46:34.610 --> 03:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
um he's been with us since the beginning
 
03:46:36.650 --> 03:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
03:46:39.410 --> 03:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
um our he has been studying and getting
 
03:46:41.330 --> 03:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
the lab in a position where we can
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
actually open it up for use which is a
 
03:46:45.889 --> 03:46:45.899 align:start position:0%
great accomplishment because it takes a
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
um Manpower and know-how to get that up
 
03:46:52.969 --> 03:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
and running our lab went down in 2015
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
because the pers the person that was in
 
03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
that position was actually
 
03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:00.849 align:start position:0%
that position was actually
um

03:47:00.849 --> 03:47:00.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
asked to come work for the National
 
03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
Institute of Standards and technology
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
and he took that position
 
03:47:11.210 --> 03:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
which left us without a metrologist and
 
03:47:13.250 --> 03:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
we did look for quite some time for
 
03:47:16.490 --> 03:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
someone to fill in that position but it
 
03:47:19.070 --> 03:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
is a very very difficult position to
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
fill and it takes a unique type of
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
person to fill that and so it's been a
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
struggle but we finally got one in 2020
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
he's been working very hard to get our
 
03:47:32.990 --> 03:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
our lab up and running and
 
03:47:34.370 --> 03:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
um the good news is is that it's going
 
03:47:36.889 --> 03:47:36.899 align:start position:0%
to happen very soon so we're happy about
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
that in 2020 our our office
 
03:47:41.279 --> 03:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
that in 2020 our our office
um

03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
oh let me finish going through these we
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
have one part-time metrologist who
 
03:47:48.769 --> 03:47:48.779 align:start position:0%
actually was the director of weights and
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
measures when I came on board in 2006.
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
he has come back to help us get our lab
 
03:47:56.690 --> 03:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
up and running and then we have Three
 
03:47:58.969 --> 03:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
Investigators our state is
 
03:47:58.979 --> 03:47:59.690 align:start position:0%
Investigators our state is
um

03:47:59.690 --> 03:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:02.929 --> 03:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
divided up into six different areas and
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
each of our investigators has two of
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:48:09.120 --> 03:48:10.190 align:start position:0%
with that
um

03:48:10.190 --> 03:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:11.809 --> 03:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
a big part of our role and
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to make sure that we
 
03:48:16.010 --> 03:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
know where those devices are that are
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
being used commercially
 
03:48:21.170 --> 03:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
the state also has allowed service
 
03:48:23.809 --> 03:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
companies to have licensed service
 
03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
technicians who are generally the ones
 
03:48:29.150 --> 03:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
who are going out and state certifying
 
03:48:32.050 --> 03:48:32.060 align:start position:0%
so we don't we do some in-house
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
certifying but the majority of all the
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
certification that is done
 
03:48:40.849 --> 03:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
um by these licensed service technicians
 
03:48:40.859 --> 03:48:41.929 align:start position:0%
um by these licensed service technicians
um

03:48:41.929 --> 03:48:41.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
it comes with its challenges because we
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't have Hands-On for all of those
 
03:48:50.090 --> 03:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
devices ourselves to make sure that
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing the proper examination
 
03:48:55.130 --> 03:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
procedures on those devices every year
 
03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
because they need to be certified every
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
year and so
 
03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
um we have two thousand I mean 210
 
03:49:03.769 --> 03:49:03.779 align:start position:0%
service technicians we have a thousand
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
twenty five way Masters that are
 
03:49:06.769 --> 03:49:06.779 align:start position:0%
licensed with us and those are the
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
individuals who are given the authority
 
03:49:13.070 --> 03:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
to produce weight tickets when a vehicle
 
03:49:16.370 --> 03:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
scale is being used so we're it's when
 
03:49:19.490 --> 03:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
they're moving large commodities
 
03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
um we also licensed 20 000 commercial
 
03:49:24.170 --> 03:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
weighing and measuring devices that are
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.050 --> 03:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
so we also have an enforcement piece and
 
03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
this is a huge piece because of all
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
those 20 000 plus the people that we
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
license so the weighing devices as you
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
may well guess you know it's anywhere
 
03:49:46.250 --> 03:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
from jewelry scales Deli scales all the
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
way up to Big vehicle scales we have
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
measuring devices you know your gas
 
03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:52.910 align:start position:0%
measuring devices you know your gas
pumps

03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
pumps
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
um oil and propane delivery meters that
 
03:49:58.370 --> 03:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
furnish us with home heating fuel
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
checking the net content and volume
 
03:50:05.090 --> 03:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
of packages
 
03:50:07.190 --> 03:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
we have price verification making sure
 
03:50:09.170 --> 03:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
that the price on the Shelf is what
 
03:50:11.570 --> 03:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
you're getting at the register we have
 
03:50:14.210 --> 03:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
unit price verification which
 
03:50:16.690 --> 03:50:16.700 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people don't
 
03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
May pay attention to but it's used in
 
03:50:22.370 --> 03:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
order to do value comparison between one
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
product and another that are of similar
 
03:50:24.479 --> 03:50:26.090 align:start position:0%
product and another that are of similar
type

03:50:26.090 --> 03:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
type
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
we have packaging labeling compliance
 
03:50:30.290 --> 03:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
this is where
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
um you know different agencies
 
03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the state have packaging and
 
03:50:37.849 --> 03:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements but we also do too
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
and so some of the challenges that we
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
Face are making sure that people
 
03:50:44.570 --> 03:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
understand that they don't just have to
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of one agency but
 
03:50:49.250 --> 03:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
there are several agencies that may be
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
involved in packaging and labeling
 
03:50:53.929 --> 03:50:53.939 align:start position:0%
requirements we also get a lot of
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
complaints regarding the sale of
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
firewood so we we partner with plant
 
03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
industry with forestry we've done
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
presentations to help people understand
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
how to actually measure the amount of
 
03:51:07.849 --> 03:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
firewood that they are getting and how
 
03:51:10.130 --> 03:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
to determine if they were fairly dealt
 
03:51:10.140 --> 03:51:11.090 align:start position:0%
to determine if they were fairly dealt
with

03:51:11.090 --> 03:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
we also do audits of businesses those
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
service technicians because they're the
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
ones out there doing the state
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
certifying and I want them to be doing
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
it the correct way
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
and also way Masters
 
03:51:27.170 --> 03:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is just one of our investigators
 
03:51:28.969 --> 03:51:28.979 align:start position:0%
that was out using some of our equipment
 
03:51:32.150 --> 03:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
to test the measure of fuel at a
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:40.610 --> 03:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
we also do educational Outreach
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um to the regulated Community because we
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
think the most one of the most important
 
03:51:46.849 --> 03:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
things is to educate people if people
 
03:51:49.250 --> 03:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't know how to
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
um abide by the regulations then it's
 
03:51:53.090 --> 03:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
not going to do any good for us to
 
03:51:55.370 --> 03:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
expect it of them if they don't know
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
about it so we do a lot of of Outreach
 
03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
just one small example is the New
 
03:52:03.650 --> 03:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm forest and garden expo we
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
do scale clinics for New Hampshire
 
03:52:07.250 --> 03:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
agricultural businesses which has been
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
very successful we used to have people
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
going out to the individual Farms to do
 
03:52:13.610 --> 03:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
all the farm scales but we found that it
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
was not a very good use of our time so
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
we have devised a way to have 11 or 12
 
03:52:22.910 --> 03:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
scale clinics throughout the year so
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
that farmers and those who are in the
 
03:52:27.769 --> 03:52:27.779 align:start position:0%
agriculture Community can come to us and
 
03:52:30.050 --> 03:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
we will certify their scales for free so
 
03:52:32.090 --> 03:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
that is a great benefit to our
 
03:52:35.210 --> 03:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community we also partner
 
03:52:36.530 --> 03:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
in some things with the New Hampshire
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
grows Grocers Association so that they
 
03:52:42.889 --> 03:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
have information on how how best
 
03:52:45.410 --> 03:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
practices are when selling commodities
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
and then science technology engineering
 
03:52:51.290 --> 03:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
and math is really important it's one of
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
the stem programs and weights and
 
03:52:54.410 --> 03:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
measures Falls right in line with that
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
especially with our Metrology lab just
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
recently we went to the Nashua School of
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
Science and design and taught six
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
classes to 12 and 13 year olds so that
 
03:53:06.110 --> 03:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
they could understand what weights and
 
03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
measures was all about because I would
 
03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
dare say that um there's a a lot of
 
03:53:13.790 --> 03:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
individuals adults out there that have
 
03:53:16.610 --> 03:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
no idea what weights and measures is and
 
03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:26.450 --> 03:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
the Metrology lab we do maintain the
 
03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:27.590 align:start position:0%
the Metrology lab we do maintain the
state's

03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
state's
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
um standards these standards are used
 
03:53:32.570 --> 03:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
when they are doing calibration work in
 
03:53:34.210 --> 03:53:34.220 align:start position:0%
the lab
 
03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
every state was provided by the federal
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
government a set of standards and so we
 
03:53:44.570 --> 03:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
we highly prize these we have
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
thousands hundreds of thousands of
 
03:53:48.290 --> 03:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
dollars of equipment in our Metrology
 
03:53:51.490 --> 03:53:51.500 align:start position:0%
lab so it's really important for us to
 
03:53:53.809 --> 03:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is a successful
 
03:53:55.969 --> 03:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
Endeavor there aren't very many Labs
 
03:53:58.250 --> 03:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and when our lab
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
went down it was a huge
 
03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:01.429 align:start position:0%
went down it was a huge
um

03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:04.010 --> 03:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
it like it hurt
 
03:54:05.929 --> 03:54:05.939 align:start position:0%
um not only just our state but other
 
03:54:08.050 --> 03:54:08.060 align:start position:0%
states because sometimes other states
 
03:54:10.250 --> 03:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
send their equipment to us for
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
calibration and so it's really important
 
03:54:14.030 --> 03:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
for us to get that up and running as
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
soon as we possibly can because
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
um not only are they certifying the
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
equipment that we use out for our field
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
standards but it's also the the field
 
03:54:24.290 --> 03:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
standards that our service technicians
 
03:54:26.929 --> 03:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
are using to test the equipment that's
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
um we also in partnership with a
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
different few different organizations
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
this is not an exhaustive list but we
 
03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
work a hundred percent in conjunction
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
with the National Conference on weights
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
and measures
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a professional non-for-profit
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
Association of state and local weights
 
03:54:52.750 --> 03:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
and measures officials federal agencies
 
03:54:56.150 --> 03:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers retailers and consumers so
 
03:54:58.610 --> 03:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
you as an individual could be a member
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
of that conference as well they what we
 
03:55:03.530 --> 03:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
do is we work to develop national
 
03:55:05.330 --> 03:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
weights and measure standards and that
 
03:55:07.849 --> 03:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
has been happening since 1905. the
 
03:55:09.650 --> 03:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
organization brings the right interests
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
together to keep Pace with Innovative
 
03:55:13.729 --> 03:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
advancements in the marketplace and
 
03:55:16.969 --> 03:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
right now we are really focusing on
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging stations
 
03:55:21.170 --> 03:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
because they're just becoming so more
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
prevalent currently we are we have no
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
equipment to test those devices there is
 
03:55:30.290 --> 03:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
some test equipment that has come about
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
that we are are very interested in
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
utilizing but we one do not have the
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
funding for it and we don't have the the
 
03:55:40.849 --> 03:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
manpower to do that so somehow we're
 
03:55:43.130 --> 03:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
going to have to come up with a means of
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
keeping up with technology and the
 
03:55:47.330 --> 03:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
advancements in the market
 
03:55:49.010 --> 03:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
we also partner with the National
 
03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
Institute of Standards and Technology
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
their office promotes uniformity equity

and sius and traceability in weights and
 
03:55:58.130 --> 03:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
measures by advancing National and
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
international legal Metrology standards

test procedures capabilities and
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
training the individuals with nist they
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
are our subject matter experts because
 
03:56:09.889 --> 03:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
there are so many devices in the market
 
03:56:11.929 --> 03:56:11.939 align:start position:0%
right now we can't possibly know
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
everything about every single individual
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
device and so
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
we have them as our resource and we
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
utilize them they probably hear from us
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
more often than they would like but they
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
are also always so
 
03:56:27.769 --> 03:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
um gracious in answering our questions
 
03:56:29.630 --> 03:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
and helping us to figure out the right
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
way to do something
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
we also work with local law enforcement
 
03:56:38.090 --> 03:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
when when it's necessary we work with
 
03:56:41.150 --> 03:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
UNH Cooperative Extension Office they
 
03:56:43.150 --> 03:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
are a great race resource for
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
information and they are the ones that
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
help us to have helped us in the past to
 
03:56:50.809 --> 03:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
get places that we can hold our scale
 
03:56:54.769 --> 03:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
clinics des and Dot have also
 
03:56:56.450 --> 03:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
collaborated with us on a few important
 
03:56:58.729 --> 03:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
topics such as refueling issues and
 
03:57:04.130 --> 03:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that we have
 
03:57:07.199 --> 03:57:08.150 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that we have
um

03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
paying employees a competitive salary
 
03:57:13.250 --> 03:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
resources to purchase needed equipment
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
software programs that are up to date we
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
have had a software program that has not
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
been supported since 2007 it was
 
03:57:24.050 --> 03:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually initially started in the the
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
program itself was developed in the 80s
 
03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
the early 80s and we have been working
 
03:57:31.689 --> 03:57:31.699 align:start position:0%
on another
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
venture since 2 May of 2016 when a
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
contract was signed we still do not have
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
a product so may have this year we still
 
03:57:44.170 --> 03:57:44.180 align:start position:0%
do not have a usable product
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
to replace what we currently have and so
 
03:57:48.840 --> 03:57:49.849 align:start position:0%
to replace what we currently have and so
um

03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
I know that the commissioner is very
 
03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:53.330 align:start position:0%
I know that the commissioner is very
um

03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
supportive of us getting the needed help
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
but it's it's things such as technology
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
and keeping up with the times we still
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
can't take credit cards and so there are
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
things that we are lacking that would
 
03:58:10.250 --> 03:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
help us to advance so much more if we
 
03:58:10.260 --> 03:58:11.269 align:start position:0%
help us to advance so much more if we
had

03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:58:14.210 --> 03:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
um the support of proper software and
 
03:58:14.220 --> 03:58:16.010 align:start position:0%
um the support of proper software and
such

03:58:16.010 --> 03:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
such
 
03:58:16.020 --> 03:58:16.729 align:start position:0%
such
um

03:58:16.729 --> 03:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
we have a declining service technician
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
pool you saw that we have 210 service
 
03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
technicians back in 2017 when the last
 
03:58:28.250 --> 03:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
person gave this presentation we had
 
03:58:28.260 --> 03:58:30.170 align:start position:0%
person gave this presentation we had
280.

03:58:30.170 --> 03:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
280.
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
um and we have we have inquired about
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
that it's a declining it's an aging
 
03:58:36.239 --> 03:58:38.330 align:start position:0%
that it's a declining it's an aging
um

03:58:38.330 --> 03:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
service technician pool
 
03:58:43.490 --> 03:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's harder to get young people to want
 
03:58:45.290 --> 03:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
to go into the trade
 
03:58:48.490 --> 03:58:48.500 align:start position:0%
and with that some of that will end up
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
relying on us and our investigators in
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
order to do some of that work but it is
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
very difficult to
 
03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
um our laws and rules are very old
 
03:59:08.030 --> 03:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
um it's some of the challenges that we
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
have is that it's a slow process and
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
I personally would actually love to have
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
some guidance and in cleaning them up
 
03:59:20.150 --> 03:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
both the laws and roles because some of
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
them are no longer applicable some of
 
03:59:24.290 --> 03:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
them need to be updated so that it
 
03:59:25.370 --> 03:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
includes some of these newer
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
Technologies and such
 
03:59:31.130 --> 03:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
that is all I have so I look forward to
 
03:59:35.570 --> 03:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for such an interesting
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
presentation on such a weighty prod
 
03:59:39.359 --> 03:59:41.090 align:start position:0%
presentation on such a weighty prod
issue

03:59:41.090 --> 03:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:43.319 --> 03:59:47.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
great

03:59:47.710 --> 03:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:02.269 --> 04:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.610 --> 04:00:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.809 --> 04:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
what's being passed out now is
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
approximately uh is is a copy of
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 slides I do not intend
 
04:00:27.530 --> 04:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
to go through all 30 slides but what you
 
04:00:29.210 --> 04:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
have there is information necessary to
 
04:00:30.530 --> 04:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
get into the depths of some of the
 
04:00:32.809 --> 04:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
programs that I or we offer in the
 
04:00:35.330 --> 04:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
division and Regulatory Services
 
04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
um with with references URLs so you
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
could really get in if you really want
 
04:00:41.689 --> 04:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
to understand it that information is
 
04:00:41.699 --> 04:00:42.769 align:start position:0%
to understand it that information is
there

04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:00:42.779 --> 04:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
there
um

04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good opportunity to
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
sort of summarize some of the stuff I've
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
heard already and really if you're going
 
04:00:51.650 --> 04:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
to walk out of here
 
04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't oh I'm sorry
 
04:00:56.330 --> 04:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm out Wyman I'm a division director
 
04:00:58.490 --> 04:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
regulatory services
 
04:00:58.500 --> 04:01:01.309 align:start position:0%
regulatory services
um

04:01:01.309 --> 04:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
you could see here
 
04:01:03.120 --> 04:01:04.910 align:start position:0%
you could see here
the

04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
the primary objective of regulatory
 
04:01:09.530 --> 04:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
Services is is according to what is
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
written is marketing right so a lot of
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
people might think that's labels and and
 
04:01:16.010 --> 04:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
so forth but really the focus that we
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
have in this is is associated with
 
04:01:19.010 --> 04:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
safety it's it's safety for human
 
04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
consumption safety for pet consumption
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's safety for commercial feed
 
04:01:23.760 --> 04:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
it's safety for commercial feed
um

04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:24.960 --> 04:01:27.469 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:30.530 --> 04:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know I have 12
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
programs in this division that I oversee
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh fisma really belongs here but to
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
honestly just cannot handle it we're
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
trying to handle 12 programs with six
 
04:01:42.769 --> 04:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
staff I only have five right now we're
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
trying to fill an open position it's
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
difficult uh but but we do I think have
 
04:01:48.769 --> 04:01:48.779 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in
 
04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and and before I get into this though
 
04:01:51.889 --> 04:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
I really want to re-emphasize because
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
you guys are getting a lot of
 
04:01:54.170 --> 04:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
information I'm just going to hit you
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
with a lot more right and I think the
 
04:01:58.849 --> 04:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
biggest concern I see I've been in this
 
04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
position for a little over a year I came
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
out of the private sector thing that
 
04:02:04.729 --> 04:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
hits me hard and it hits me the most is
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
the I.T like I I worked a lot with with
 
04:02:11.210 --> 04:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
with the you know some of the Des stuff
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
and and all that and I've worked in in
 
04:02:16.010 --> 04:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
the Commonwealth of mass
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
we're using systems from the like like
 
04:02:20.330 --> 04:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
it was said a fox Pro is developed in
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
84. we can't even find people to to
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
maintain it and and we're still putting
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
things I have 20 000 plus registrations
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
that I put in by hand and I have
 
04:02:31.490 --> 04:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
somebody who does all day all they do is
 
04:02:35.090 --> 04:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
separate out checks it that is from my
 
04:02:36.250 --> 04:02:36.260 align:start position:0%
perspective that's the biggest
 
04:02:38.450 --> 04:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
bottleneck right there so regardless of
 
04:02:41.090 --> 04:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
what I say here and what you've heard my
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
point is to try to re-emphasize that
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
it's important I think we have a good
 
04:02:47.570 --> 04:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
um relationship here hopefully running
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
into the future where we can assist each
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
other you guys can help push that and we
 
04:02:54.530 --> 04:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
can help uh realize efficiencies across
 
04:02:56.030 --> 04:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
the whole department not just animal
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
industry who has an RFP out there and
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
you should know in the back of the end
 
04:03:02.929 --> 04:03:02.939 align:start position:0%
of that RFP are also requests for costs
 
04:03:04.250 --> 04:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
and information associated with
 
04:03:07.250 --> 04:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
upgrading other division I.T programs
 
04:03:09.769 --> 04:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
which is a necessity so I just wanted to
 
04:03:12.050 --> 04:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
push that and and I also wanted to say
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
in in this Division I have 12 programs
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
right it's overwhelming it's it's more
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
more than really what should be in one
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
Division and and I see working with Sean
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
and into the future whether we can break
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
these down into bureaus but the primary
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
thing I want to push here is that these
 
04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
I I kind of break these down into three
 
04:03:30.889 --> 04:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
sections because I think there's a
 
04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding uh from from my
 
04:03:36.290 --> 04:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
experience to date and and what exactly
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
um what regulatory Authority we have as
 
04:03:41.689 --> 04:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
a division so we have these three
 
04:03:44.689 --> 04:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
programs and if you include fisma our
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
federal programs for which we're sort of
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
a federal agents we act as federal
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
agents on on the fed's behalf so you'll
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
see in this uh in this slide here we'll
 
04:03:56.830 --> 04:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
take the organic program as an example
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
they register us as a certifying agent
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
they license us we make decisions we
 
04:04:04.250 --> 04:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
certify Farms we report directly back to
 
04:04:06.170 --> 04:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
the USDA we don't report back to the
 
04:04:06.180 --> 04:04:07.250 align:start position:0%
the USDA we don't report back to the
commissioner

04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
um we don't report back to legislature
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
right we have an agreement with USDA who
 
04:04:14.809 --> 04:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
authorizes us to do the work on their
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
behalf and so there's been a lot of
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
confusion on that when the when the feds
 
04:04:20.630 --> 04:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
say we can and cannot do things
 
04:04:22.610 --> 04:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
if by law I have to follow the federal
 
04:04:25.969 --> 04:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
uh statements on that and that's that's
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
true of uh of the gap program it's true
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
of the country of origin program in fact
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
they tell us who to go inspect right the
 
04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
feds tell us and then the food safety
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
modernization act I can't say a lot
 
04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
about it's not in my Division I don't
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
understand it fully but I do understand
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
that it falls under those same sets
 
04:04:49.610 --> 04:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
where again it's a federal programs
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out because I know
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
you guys deal with legislative bills
 
04:04:56.150 --> 04:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
that come through here and and one of
 
04:04:57.410 --> 04:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
the things I also want to push aside
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
from the I.T if I haven't said it again
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
the it is that uh
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
um when you guys make legislative uh
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
mandates it's great if you come to us
 
04:05:09.769 --> 04:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
and ask us I'm noticing that because
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
um things get put I've noticed that
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
things have gotten put in the state rsas
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
that don't match other states right so
 
04:05:20.330 --> 04:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
we may be one of all the states that
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
require something and and I get phone
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
calls from Purina let's say and say Al
 
04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
what's going on here you guys have this
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
in your RSA I'm like yeah I know I said
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
well I can't change my whole
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing line just to meet your
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
mandate hey man I so if you guys come
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
and talk to us before you make these
 
04:05:38.330 --> 04:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
rsas it's extraordinarily helpful
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
because we can help you say okay this is
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
maybe the best way to achieve your
 
04:05:43.370 --> 04:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
objective these are your objectives
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
we're mandated to do what you tell us
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
but it's easier for us to to do that if
 
04:05:51.050 --> 04:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
if we're in communication before these
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
things you know are finalized and and I
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
say that because these National programs
 
04:05:56.929 --> 04:05:56.939 align:start position:0%
um and I know you guys have been dealing
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
with some fertilizer issues we have
 
04:06:00.889 --> 04:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
commercial feed commercial seed I think
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
might be coming through Horticulture
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
grade one biostimulants you know
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
um these are all all these programs in
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
the middle here are are based on
 
04:06:09.420 --> 04:06:10.910 align:start position:0%
the middle here are are based on
National

04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
National
 
04:06:14.330 --> 04:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
um legislative model bills that have
 
04:06:16.849 --> 04:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
been presented from places like AFCO
 
04:06:16.859 --> 04:06:18.170 align:start position:0%
been presented from places like AFCO
ASCO

04:06:18.170 --> 04:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
ASCO
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
um you know what those organ in others
 
04:06:23.650 --> 04:06:23.660 align:start position:0%
what those organizations are actually a
 
04:06:25.370 --> 04:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
conglomeration if that's the right word
 
04:06:28.130 --> 04:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
of state legislators uh division
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
directors all over the country
 
04:06:32.450 --> 04:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
um technical experts I mean people
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's all they do risk characterization
 
04:06:38.110 --> 04:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
of animals pet feed laboratory analyzes
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
the best in the country get together and
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
they they develop model plans that then
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
they give to all the states and they say
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
look this is the best we can come up
 
04:06:49.490 --> 04:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
with and generally all the states that
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
degree in in the legislator uh
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
committees or bodies will adopt that but
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
if you throw something in there that
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been adopted on a national
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
level yet it can create a problem so I
 
04:07:02.689 --> 04:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
just want to emphasize that we don't
 
04:07:04.250 --> 04:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
want to make things more difficult for
 
04:07:07.610 --> 04:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
our stakeholders that's you know
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
now the third section here is actually
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
the state the state rsas that you guys
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
have complete control over right and uh
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
the biggest one I think for us is to is
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
the seal equality program where and
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
these are voluntary a lot of these are
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary too so keep in mind if we go
 
04:07:26.210 --> 04:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
out for instance and do an organic
 
04:07:27.769 --> 04:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
inspection it's because somebody's asked
 
04:07:29.330 --> 04:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
to come out and they want that Organic
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
certification it's completely voluntary
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
if they won't let us on their Farm or
 
04:07:35.929 --> 04:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
they won't let us see something
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
that's their right but we can't give
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
them that certification it's you know so
 
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
so a lot of that stuff is is voluntary a
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
lot of this stuff like steel equality on
 
04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
the state side is voluntary and what
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
that entails let's take Maple for
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
instance hey I want you to certify that
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
my maple product meets a certain
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
standard great we're going to have to go
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
through all your stuff you're gonna have
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
to be comfortable with us going through
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
your business plans things like that you
 
04:07:59.809 --> 04:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
know some of this stuff gets
 
04:08:01.969 --> 04:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily in depth
 
04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
um some people aren't comfortable with
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
that and rightfully so maybe again
 
04:08:05.640 --> 04:08:07.370 align:start position:0%
that and rightfully so maybe again
voluntary

04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
04:08:09.290 --> 04:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that's of Interest too
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
if I'm straight three or four of these
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
programs take all our time and and we're
 
04:08:19.250 --> 04:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
reactionary to the rest of them all
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
right I'm dealing with five I have five
 
04:08:22.969 --> 04:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
people anytime somebody goes out and
 
04:08:24.110 --> 04:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
gives and does a higher level
 
04:08:27.650 --> 04:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement I'm busy right three people
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
come in and say ah we just went out we
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
went to a local and this is what we
 
04:08:31.080 --> 04:08:32.330 align:start position:0%
went to a local and this is what we
found

04:08:32.330 --> 04:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
found
 
04:08:35.090 --> 04:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
that takes up all my time and so it's so
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very difficult thing to to
 
04:08:40.670 --> 04:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
maintain these programs and then jump to
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
the level of enforcement right where
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's necessary and on the federal level
 
04:08:46.729 --> 04:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
I'm required to so somebody comes and
 
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
gives me that that's going to take my
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
time I'm gonna have to take time away
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
from some of these State programs and I
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
think you're going to find out with all
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
all of us where the staff issues where
 
04:08:57.769 --> 04:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
we we try to integrate our programs as
 
04:09:00.410 --> 04:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
best we can to meet the the what you
 
04:09:02.450 --> 04:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
guys require us to do
 
04:09:04.610 --> 04:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's a difficult thing to do
 
04:09:07.250 --> 04:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna say it again the greatest
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
way of efficiency I think for this
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
department is through it upgrades and
 
04:09:14.809 --> 04:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
that's a real real thing and we need to
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
have uh legislative backing and money to
 
04:09:20.450 --> 04:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
do that right we we can't
 
04:09:20.460 --> 04:09:22.370 align:start position:0%
do that right we we can't
um

04:09:22.370 --> 04:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:24.110 --> 04:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
I just put this up here at department
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
environmental services because you know
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
you can see how their divisions kind of
 
04:09:29.330 --> 04:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
broken up and they have bureaus and I
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
think certainly in my division would be
 
04:09:32.450 --> 04:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
so it would be helpful if we were broken
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
up in into bureaus now the federal
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
program uh national account program I
 
04:09:40.130 --> 04:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
kind of put some numbers here you could
 
04:09:42.290 --> 04:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
see 80 producers what does that mean
 
04:09:44.570 --> 04:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
well do you go out and visit 80 Farms
 
04:09:47.389 --> 04:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
you spend 80 Days that's anybody wants
 
04:09:48.769 --> 04:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
to go into that program again voluntary
 
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
we're going through their business plans
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
or going through their their um other
 
04:09:55.130 --> 04:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
Horticultural plans where it's a very
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
in-depth uh view of of their business
 
04:10:01.130 --> 04:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
right so it takes a lot of time takes a
 
04:10:03.530 --> 04:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
lot of effort and then if we get uh as I
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
said before if we had some higher level
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues it really chews up a
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
um good agricultural practices country
 
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
of origin labeling
 
04:10:12.300 --> 04:10:12.950 align:start position:0%
of origin labeling
um

04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:15.410 --> 04:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
oh this is interesting so and and I
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
bring up organic because of the recent
 
04:10:20.150 --> 04:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
issues that that I've I've uh uh you
 
04:10:22.010 --> 04:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
know associated with with the dropping
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
of livestock and so forth
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
um I have five people right now that
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
includes me this is this is what our
 
04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
surrounding uh agents have it's 13 12 16
 
04:10:34.250 --> 04:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
19 25 and that's really what it takes to
 
04:10:35.929 --> 04:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
run a program like that
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
um we're down to crops and we'll see how
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.520 --> 04:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:45.410 --> 04:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
we had an audit where the feds came in
 
04:10:46.969 --> 04:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
and said you guys are way understaffed
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't going to change so
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh the gap program again this is
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
microbial food safety is really what it
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
focuses on I I want to bring your
 
04:10:56.929 --> 04:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
attention to that because because again
 
04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's a marketing or marketing is our
 
04:11:01.490 --> 04:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
directive but really a lot of what we do
 
04:11:02.929 --> 04:11:02.939 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what we focus is on on
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
safety safety for for human consumption
 
04:11:07.849 --> 04:11:07.859 align:start position:0%
safety for pet food safety for across
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
the board commercial feed
 
04:11:10.969 --> 04:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
you certainly don't want to be getting
 
04:11:13.370 --> 04:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
something to your your 100 cows and then
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then come home the next day and find
 
04:11:17.689 --> 04:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
there's a problem right
 
04:11:17.699 --> 04:11:18.710 align:start position:0%
there's a problem right
um

04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
you know some of the checklists that we
 
04:11:21.410 --> 04:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
have to go through when we're doing
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
these inspections we have to do a couple
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
of a couple of inspections not just one
 
04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
you know very time consuming I have one
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
person who is licensed by the federal
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
government to do this or just got a
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
second person license and he quit
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
because honestly the pay is better
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and that's that's a fair you
 
04:11:42.769 --> 04:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
know I can't you can't blame anybody for
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
that we just got an authorization to
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
train a second person that's a 18 to 24
 
04:11:48.410 --> 04:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
months is what's going to take to train
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
a second person uh but we'll we'll
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
manage it
 
04:11:54.050 --> 04:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
you know I beat that one to death
 
04:11:55.729 --> 04:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
National programs
 
04:11:58.610 --> 04:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh feed fertilizer seed
 
04:12:00.889 --> 04:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
what I want to point out here is is in
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
the feed in pet food program when that
 
04:12:05.110 --> 04:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
started off I think I think I was told
 
04:12:08.410 --> 04:12:08.420 align:start position:0%
of I think in
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
200456 fluctuated between four and five
 
04:12:13.490 --> 04:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
thousand hey great we're gonna put this
 
04:12:15.650 --> 04:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
in Excel at the time that was
 
04:12:19.070 --> 04:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
now we're off to almost 20 000 and we're
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
still doing it by hand and and we it's
 
04:12:23.330 --> 04:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
unsustainable and every time we make a
 
04:12:24.830 --> 04:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
mistake and when we separate a check
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
right because we have to separate it
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
between two different funds the general
 
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
fund and a scale fund the two and the
 
04:12:33.410 --> 04:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
five are right next to each other on the
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
computer now you hit one by accident
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
you've done a thousand of these in a day
 
04:12:40.490 --> 04:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh trying to find that mistake going
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
back uh in in uh at the Comptroller's
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
office is is a nightmare right so all
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
this can be avoided Again by that up I.T
 
04:12:48.120 --> 04:12:49.130 align:start position:0%
this can be avoided Again by that up I.T
upgrade

04:12:49.130 --> 04:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
04:12:49.140 --> 04:12:50.870 align:start position:0%
upgrade
uh

04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:54.889 --> 04:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
uh oh this is cool so
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
another thing we get a lot of phone
 
04:12:59.210 --> 04:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
calls from small producers of pet food
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
products that don't want to pay the
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
registration fee like ah you know that's
 
04:13:05.090 --> 04:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
not my call that's legislative call I
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
can't legally say you can't pay it when
 
04:13:09.170 --> 04:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
somebody else has to right trying to
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
explain that but I want to explain to
 
04:13:11.330 --> 04:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of the time it takes us to review
 
04:13:16.370 --> 04:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
these is because of mistakes made from
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
the smaller manufacturers because they
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't have what Purina has experts
 
04:13:22.250 --> 04:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's all they do right a small
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer here in New Hampshire
 
04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're trying to wing it you know
 
04:13:26.809 --> 04:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
they're going through the rags they have
 
04:13:28.370 --> 04:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
questions we help them as best we can
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
but um it takes a lot of time to review
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
that stuff that the people don't want to
 
04:13:35.929 --> 04:13:35.939 align:start position:0%
pay for and the reality is
 
04:13:37.490 --> 04:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
we have people trying to put stuff into
 
04:13:39.729 --> 04:13:39.739 align:start position:0%
pet food all the time that is not
 
04:13:42.170 --> 04:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be feeding a dog or a cat
 
04:13:45.290 --> 04:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form dangerous but
 
04:13:48.170 --> 04:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
they're there and then we get we get the
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
car well I I I can eat it it's fine oh
 
04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
my goodness well and so there's a lot of
 
04:13:56.570 --> 04:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
time wasted in that as well where we
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
have to interact a lot with people
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not just that we're going out
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
there looking at labels going to retail
 
04:14:06.370 --> 04:14:06.380 align:start position:0%
facilities we're actually doing a lot
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
that act alone generates a lot of
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
additional work and effort
 
04:14:11.279 --> 04:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
additional work and effort
um

04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.130 --> 04:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
some examples of registration of the
 
04:14:17.450 --> 04:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
registration process what we're looking
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
at when somebody comes in they pay that
 
04:14:21.050 --> 04:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
75 bucks and they they want that one pet
 
04:14:22.490 --> 04:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
food label review this is what we're
 
04:14:24.290 --> 04:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
reviewing we have medical claims we're
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking for unsafe ingredients the
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
nutritional values and the guaranteed
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
analysis have to be proven out we're
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking for misleading terms the label
 
04:14:34.130 --> 04:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
formats the last thing we really that's
 
04:14:35.809 --> 04:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
of importance to us although legally
 
04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
because you've mandated it there's
 
04:14:39.530 --> 04:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
certain things label formats we have to
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
follow through with and we do
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh the fertilizer sampling program came
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
online recently after being off for a
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
while because of you know staffing
 
04:14:50.689 --> 04:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
issues and I just want to know when when
 
04:14:52.729 --> 04:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
if if we get a lot of calls for people
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
who want sampling of fertilizer it's a
 
04:14:57.650 --> 04:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
massive it it once one set of samples
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
results in a a long effort right so uh
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
every action has a reaction
 
04:15:08.210 --> 04:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
these are some of the typical questions
 
04:15:10.010 --> 04:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're looking at and this is what makes
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
it difficult to fill a position like
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
this is we need risk characterization
 
04:15:14.570 --> 04:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
Specialists right we need people to
 
04:15:15.889 --> 04:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
understand what chemicals are how they
 
04:15:17.330 --> 04:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
interact in the body how they interact
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the past all that kind of stuff and
 
04:15:21.530 --> 04:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
and we're starting them off at 40
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
something thousand so you know we deal
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
with it it's not uh it's not a point
 
04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
here it's just not looking at labels
 
04:15:31.849 --> 04:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's really getting into the safety of
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
the product that's being fed to your
 
04:15:33.359 --> 04:15:34.610 align:start position:0%
the product that's being fed to your
animals

04:15:34.610 --> 04:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:15:34.620 --> 04:15:35.269 align:start position:0%
animals
um

04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:36.769 --> 04:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
these are the state programs the
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
programs that you guys have complete
 
04:15:40.729 --> 04:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
control over uh nutrient Management's a
 
04:15:43.130 --> 04:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
great one we just got a complaint where
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
somebody jumped to an estimated five
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
tons of pumpkins right so we work with
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
the nhds on stuff like that because our
 
04:15:53.150 --> 04:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
Authority uh we're authorized to go out
 
04:15:56.689 --> 04:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
and do inspections uh at farms as the
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
first means so that we dealing we're
 
04:16:00.170 --> 04:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
dealing with the pharmacy I think the es
 
04:16:01.969 --> 04:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
but if sometimes it gets to a point
 
04:16:03.290 --> 04:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
where it's beyond us we'll go straight
 
04:16:06.290 --> 04:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
to Des or we don't get the response from
 
04:16:07.610 --> 04:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
the farmer that's
 
04:16:11.030 --> 04:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
required to fix the issue and then it's
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
a des regulations so we have to go
 
04:16:15.889 --> 04:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
through them uh Farm commodities
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh oh the agricultural land protection
 
04:16:20.450 --> 04:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good one it's it's uh we
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
go out and do inspections to make sure
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
that people are staying within the uh um
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
deed restrictions that are put on that
 
04:16:28.010 --> 04:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
property that you guys paid for or the
 
04:16:30.889 --> 04:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paid for uh and again when we
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
find a problem there it just results in
 
04:16:34.130 --> 04:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
a whole nother thing of higher level
 
04:16:36.889 --> 04:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues up time
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
the uh certified native Lumber you want
 
04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
to actually extraordinary they do most
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
of that work we just sent out the
 
04:16:45.290 --> 04:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
certificates God bless them
 
04:16:45.300 --> 04:16:45.950 align:start position:0%
certificates God bless them
um

04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:48.769 --> 04:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
some of the uh if you
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
down here the procedures for our new
 
04:16:53.330 --> 04:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
treatment management complaints in in
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
how one complaint can result in really
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes weeks if not months of
 
04:16:58.260 --> 04:16:59.570 align:start position:0%
sometimes weeks if not months of
follow-up

04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
um months
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
some of the farm Commodities that we we
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
do theoretically do inspections on
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh we do get we do get to
 
04:17:10.439 --> 04:17:11.389 align:start position:0%
uh we do get we do get to
um

04:17:11.389 --> 04:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
oh that's pretty neat
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
one of these things and what I've what
 
04:17:18.050 --> 04:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
I've sort of uh emphasized already is a
 
04:17:21.170 --> 04:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
lot of these things are voluntary so if
 
04:17:22.729 --> 04:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
you're getting complaints from your
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
constituents you know before you come to
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
us it's it's important that you
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of the stuff you know I
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
don't want them coming onto my farm and
 
04:17:33.170 --> 04:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
doing this as well it's a voluntary
 
04:17:35.570 --> 04:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
program we don't have to that's your
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
choice but if you want that
 
04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
certification this is what we have to do
 
04:17:41.689 --> 04:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
to do it we never go
 
04:17:45.410 --> 04:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
and do on it with gap on the federal we
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
have to do an unannounced inspections
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that's been agreed to beforehand but
 
04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
I won't send my staff out to do
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
unannounced inspections anywhere at any
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
time uh it's just not safe people get
 
04:17:57.050 --> 04:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
upset you know people don't want you on
 
04:17:58.490 --> 04:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
their land and that's you know that's
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
their choice so we make phone calls now
 
04:18:03.050 --> 04:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
and we make sure that they're you know
 
04:18:04.610 --> 04:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
they know we're coming they're willing
 
04:18:07.490 --> 04:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things we look for when
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing a seal of quality or
 
04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
inspections it's it's it's not just
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
going out and looking at a piece of
 
04:18:19.130 --> 04:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
fruit we're actually uh taking
 
04:18:21.290 --> 04:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
measurements and doing all the stuff
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
and then on top of all that stuff we do
 
04:18:27.050 --> 04:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh we judge agricultural Affairs we uh
 
04:18:27.060 --> 04:18:29.330 align:start position:0%
uh we judge agricultural Affairs we uh
well

04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe I spoke to some of this
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
already the local labeling's interesting
 
04:18:36.110 --> 04:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
UNH extension
 
04:18:36.120 --> 04:18:39.710 align:start position:0%
UNH extension
uh

04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
so we also have to get out all these
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
pamphlets signs uh we do we also do uh
 
04:18:49.250 --> 04:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
clinics for hydrometer that that people
 
04:18:52.130 --> 04:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
use for for Maple production uh we
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
produce guidelines there's a lot my
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
staff is never bored and there's there's
 
04:19:01.090 --> 04:19:01.100 align:start position:0%
never need hey Al I need something to do
 
04:19:03.290 --> 04:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
like Sean said we have exceptional
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
people working for us it's great and
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.969 --> 04:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh I highlighted in red safety here
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
because although our dictate is
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
marketing really everything we're doing
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
is associated with safety
 
04:19:23.279 --> 04:19:24.710 align:start position:0%
is associated with safety
um

04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:27.650 --> 04:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
each of those 12 programs hats is its
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
own sets of laws rules state federal
 
04:19:32.450 --> 04:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're getting into local law
 
04:19:35.689 --> 04:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
as well and takes an amazing amount of
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
technical expertise that is specific to
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
each individual program so the people we
 
04:19:43.250 --> 04:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
hire really have to know a lot and they
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
really have to absorb a lot all right
 
04:19:47.150 --> 04:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm giving you the hook because before
 
04:19:50.090 --> 04:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
Josh won't have any time left all right
 
04:19:50.100 --> 04:19:51.229 align:start position:0%
Josh won't have any time left all right
um

04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's it see you later that's the last
 
04:19:53.040 --> 04:19:55.250 align:start position:0%
that's it see you later that's the last
one

04:19:55.250 --> 04:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
those are us
 
04:19:57.359 --> 04:19:59.090 align:start position:0%
those are us
thanks

04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:19:59.100 --> 04:20:04.969 align:start position:0%
thanks
I.T

04:20:04.969 --> 04:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody thanks for
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.490 --> 04:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I will be brief for time and um
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
because I just started in July I joined
 
04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
the Department in July so for you
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
freshman Representatives I feel like
 
04:20:27.410 --> 04:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
maybe a freshman State worker but so the
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
division of agricultural development is
 
04:20:31.010 --> 04:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
a little different than what you've
 
04:20:32.450 --> 04:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
heard previously from the other
 
04:20:35.090 --> 04:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
departments where uh divisions where
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
they have a heavy regulatory or uh you
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
know on the safety end making sure that
 
04:20:42.650 --> 04:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
the products are actually safe for use
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
our job is really to promote
 
04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
um the farmers themselves and the
 
04:20:51.530 --> 04:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
products to the consumers so we have a
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
two-fold mission
 
04:20:55.849 --> 04:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
to help develop opportunities for the
 
04:20:57.530 --> 04:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire producers Agricultural
 
04:21:00.110 --> 04:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
Product producers to increase the
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
competitiveness competitiveness of them
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
economically and also to you know uh
 
04:21:10.729 --> 04:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
get the value of Agriculture out to the
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
public to make sure that the consumers
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire know how valuable and
 
04:21:18.410 --> 04:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
what impact the food and products that
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
we create have in the state
 
04:21:23.689 --> 04:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
um how do we do this
 
04:21:25.790 --> 04:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's sort of two paths and and I'm
 
04:21:27.650 --> 04:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm glossing over there's a lot more
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we do but I wanted to focus on a
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
couple of issues today the grant
 
04:21:31.920 --> 04:21:33.170 align:start position:0%
couple of issues today the grant
programs

04:21:33.170 --> 04:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
um have a pretty huge impact and that's
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
mostly federal funds
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
um The Big E is um in West Springfield
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the New Hampshire building
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
our division runs that and there's uh
 
04:21:47.689 --> 04:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
that picture in the lower left is the
 
04:21:50.929 --> 04:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
Big E this past September there's a 1.5
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
million attendees go through there in 17
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
days and they get to see 16 sorry 14
 
04:21:59.090 --> 04:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
exhibitors that are New Hampshire made
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
products New Hampshire grown food and
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's always a line at the front door
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's amazing what people want and
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
our exhibitors then get calls later on
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
that say you know hey I was down at the
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
Big E I'm from Connecticut can you send
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
me some of that Maple brittle or
 
04:22:18.290 --> 04:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
whatever so it exposes our producers to
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
new um
 
04:22:24.170 --> 04:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
new new forms of uh income uh 17
 
04:22:26.150 --> 04:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrators or entertainers that show
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
uniquely New Hampshire products or
 
04:22:28.199 --> 04:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
uniquely New Hampshire products or
musicians

04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
musicians
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
um and then the photo on the right there
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
speaks to some of our informing the
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
public column the weekly Market Bulletin
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
our website and our directories and
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
marketing campaigns that's actually a
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
photo from an influencer who we worked
 
04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
with travel and tourism to get a
 
04:22:47.929 --> 04:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
Instagram campaign this year and there
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
was an influencer you know somebody who
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
has a ton of followers on Instagram that
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
can generate more uh you know Insight
 
04:22:56.809 --> 04:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
than than we could
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh and they went around to three
 
04:23:00.889 --> 04:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
or four different New Hampshire Farms
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
took pictures showed the products that
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
they had and shared them on our page as
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
well as their own which which kind of
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
double dipped for our our impact there
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to focus on the grants so
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
annually the things that we do every
 
04:23:18.410 --> 04:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
year uh specialty crop block grant
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's a USDA program
 
04:23:24.050 --> 04:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
the state Departments of Agriculture
 
04:23:26.150 --> 04:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
receive money through these programs we
 
04:23:27.469 --> 04:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
typically get between two and three
 
04:23:29.570 --> 04:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year for this
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
we have a project that we partner with
 
04:23:33.290 --> 04:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism every year and then
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money is allocated to
 
04:23:38.929 --> 04:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
other projects it's usually research or
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
promotion so a couple of examples you
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
can see there we just got done with
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
identifying cold hardy hydrangea
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
cultivars for Cut Flower production the
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
nursery industry is one of our biggest
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
industries money makers in the state so
 
04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
identifying ways that New Hampshire
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
farmers can produce something that's
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
unique or you know more competitive than
 
04:24:01.610 --> 04:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
say some you know their neighbors is
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
going to help us in the long run and
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
since 2019 we've got just under 1.5
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars in funding through that
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that we then disperse
 
04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
back out into the community the
 
04:24:14.809 --> 04:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
agricultural mini grants is something
 
04:24:16.610 --> 04:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's within house up to a thousand
 
04:24:19.269 --> 04:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
dollar matching Grant as funds allow
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's for promotion for New Hampshire
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
organizations like nonprofits Apple
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
Association Fruit Growers Association
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
maybe the Farm Bureau things like that
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and then we get into the one-time
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
grants these are new projects that have
 
04:24:35.570 --> 04:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
developed over the last couple of years
 
04:24:37.969 --> 04:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
that we're overseeing the farm and ranch
 
04:24:40.330 --> 04:24:40.340 align:start position:0%
stress assistance Network
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
522 thousand dollars awarded to us
 
04:24:45.490 --> 04:24:45.500 align:start position:0%
through USDA nifa which is the National
 
04:24:48.170 --> 04:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
Institute of food and agriculture to
 
04:24:49.969 --> 04:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
address the root causes of farmer stress
 
04:24:52.010 --> 04:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
mental health and suicide we signed an
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
mou with UNH which obviously you've
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
heard through all of the divisions
 
04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
they're a huge partner with us and they
 
04:25:00.650 --> 04:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
really are that counter side with the
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
education and the Outreach that we don't
 
04:25:06.250 --> 04:25:06.260 align:start position:0%
have as more of a regulatory department
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
and and they are funding Direct Services
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
which are really impressive
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
um you know individual family marriage
 
04:25:15.290 --> 04:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
counseling Farm transition or estate
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
planning Tax Services things like that
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
you can learn a lot about that from the
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
UNH site and if you read some of our
 
04:25:23.809 --> 04:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
Publications the local food purchase
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
assistance program nine hundred thousand
 
04:25:27.889 --> 04:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
dollars that we partnered with the food
 
04:25:31.250 --> 04:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
bank for a program that they give money
 
04:25:33.889 --> 04:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
out to their 400 partner agencies they
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
also do some contract buying and some
 
04:25:38.330 --> 04:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
bulk buying of food directly from New
 
04:25:40.370 --> 04:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire producers so that food you
 
04:25:42.410 --> 04:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
know that the the whole Trail of the
 
04:25:44.330 --> 04:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
receipts and the invoices and all that
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
stuff comes through to make sure that
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
that was purchased directly from a New
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farmer and it's kind of um you
 
04:25:52.010 --> 04:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
know we get a double uh bang for our
 
04:25:53.389 --> 04:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
buck where it goes to help the
 
04:25:53.399 --> 04:25:54.530 align:start position:0%
buck where it goes to help the
underserved

04:25:54.530 --> 04:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
04:25:57.050 --> 04:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
um the on the the folks that are hungry
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
in in the state but it also that money
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
goes into Farmers Pockets you can see
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
some of the statistics there
 
04:26:06.410 --> 04:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
we just got a local food for schools
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement another almost 600
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
000 again for purchasing directly from
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
Farmers but this is through school
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
districts so there are 44 school
 
04:26:17.210 --> 04:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
districts that meet the threshold for a
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
certain amount of low and reduced lunch
 
04:26:20.159 --> 04:26:22.130 align:start position:0%
certain amount of low and reduced lunch
um

04:26:22.130 --> 04:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
folks that that subscribe to that
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
program they're going to get served
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
through this uh 25 000 students 300
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
small farms that are expected to benefit
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
and then one that we're really excited
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
about is the meat processing
 
04:26:36.050 --> 04:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure program this comes
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
through arpa funds it's a little over a
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars broken into two
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
different Pro projects uh 260
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
000 is going to develop a certificate
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
program we don't currently have one in
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is so that the
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
workforce can have some education before
 
04:26:53.929 --> 04:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
they jump right into working at a meat
 
04:26:56.330 --> 04:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
processing facility and that's going
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
through UNH and then we have 750 000 for
 
04:27:01.450 --> 04:27:01.460 align:start position:0%
a grant program
 
04:27:05.929 --> 04:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
for building capacity labor saving and
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
value added to those meat processing
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
facilities we expect that that will be
 
04:27:13.809 --> 04:27:13.819 align:start position:0%
over subscribed there are four USDA
 
04:27:16.250 --> 04:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
inspected meat processing facilities in
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
the state if they each ask for the
 
04:27:19.729 --> 04:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
maximum award we're already over
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
subscribed and that's not talking about
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
third part already exempt in custom
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
butchers so if we can find some more
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
money for that that would be great and
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
you can see at the bottom that's a
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
little over uh four and a half million
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
dollars in funding that we've gotten
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
mostly from the federal government that
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get back into the
 
04:27:37.729 --> 04:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
hands of farmers and producers and the
 
04:27:40.130 --> 04:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
AG service providers that support them
 
04:27:42.290 --> 04:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
real quick on the informing the public
 
04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
part uh weekly Market Bulletin our
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
division puts that out started as market
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
news in 1917 and since 1923 it's been
 
04:27:52.250 --> 04:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
published weekly ever since this is
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
where farmers get news
 
04:27:57.889 --> 04:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
and the classifieds which they love
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a little dip in
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
subscriptions because there are more
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
places to get that whether it be
 
04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist or
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
things like that but we're certainly
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
looking at how we can build back our
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
subscription base we have a website
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
building on that I.T need we're redoing
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
the website right now we've talked to
 
04:28:18.290 --> 04:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
some the folks over at doit some of the
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
other departments had had budgets to
 
04:28:22.849 --> 04:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
have third parties come in and help them
 
04:28:24.769 --> 04:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
rebuild their website we're taking this
 
04:28:26.570 --> 04:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
on our own because we don't have that in
 
04:28:29.090 --> 04:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
our budget and then we do social media
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
television radio marketing
 
04:28:33.290 --> 04:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
um happy to speak to more of those
 
04:28:33.300 --> 04:28:35.450 align:start position:0%
um happy to speak to more of those
details

04:28:35.450 --> 04:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
details
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
another another time
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we've got myself the division
 
04:28:42.110 --> 04:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
director an information representative
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
who's part-time
 
04:28:47.450 --> 04:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
um word word processors uh although I'd
 
04:28:49.250 --> 04:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
like to get those titles changed one's
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
vacant there also our department
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
receptionist the other one works uh
 
04:28:54.290 --> 04:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
extremely hard on the weekly Market
 
04:28:56.210 --> 04:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
Bulletin publication design and right
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
now is currently updating our website
 
04:29:01.010 --> 04:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
because the old website platform is no
 
04:29:02.570 --> 04:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
longer supported and I cannot get a
 
04:29:05.330 --> 04:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
license so you know that's those are
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
building on those I.T things that that
 
04:29:09.649 --> 04:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
we really need to get fixed because we
 
04:29:12.649 --> 04:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
can't carry out some of our duties and
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
those are those challenges is funding
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
and then staff if if we had a couple
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
other people somebody who focused solely
 
04:29:20.929 --> 04:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
on grants
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
um you know another another program
 
04:29:25.729 --> 04:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
assistant I think all of our divisions
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
could use help but we're still
 
04:29:29.450 --> 04:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
accomplishing the things that you ask us
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
to do and and that's what I think is
 
04:29:33.410 --> 04:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
really great about this department
 
04:29:35.570 --> 04:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
and that's what I got
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate your uh
 
04:29:37.859 --> 04:29:39.530 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate your uh
presentation

04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:29:41.330 --> 04:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper
 
04:29:42.889 --> 04:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
04:29:44.689 --> 04:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
I finished right on on time but
 
04:29:46.490 --> 04:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't leave any time
 
04:29:48.410 --> 04:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
in the schedule for questions we're here
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
with your your pleasure
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
um if you want to take additional Time
 
04:29:55.250 --> 04:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
Dr Crawford had an emergency had to to
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
leave for but um you know hopefully you
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
see the enthusiasm that the directors
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
all have that we all have for our
 
04:30:03.600 --> 04:30:04.849 align:start position:0%
all have that we all have for our
mission

04:30:04.849 --> 04:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
mission
 
04:30:06.349 --> 04:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
um serving the people of the State of
 
04:30:08.090 --> 04:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so
 
04:30:10.969 --> 04:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
hard to keep the that enthusiasm down to
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
10 minutes uh that's what I was trying
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
to do but some of the directors are a
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
little bit more enthusiastic and and I
 
04:30:20.809 --> 04:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
know they gave you a tremendous amount
 
04:30:22.849 --> 04:30:22.859 align:start position:0%
of information and you know you've got
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
the handouts there we're all available
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
um to serve you of course you're our
 
04:30:31.969 --> 04:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
primary committee and we want to uh to
 
04:30:33.769 --> 04:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
be here to to help you better understand
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
what what we do and help you make sure
 
04:30:38.450 --> 04:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
that you make the best decisions the
 
04:30:40.490 --> 04:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
most informed decisions for the people
 
04:30:41.929 --> 04:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire well we
 
04:30:44.809 --> 04:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much for your time
 
04:30:46.550 --> 04:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I know there are a few hands up so
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
we've got uh maybe a minute or two
 
04:30:51.889 --> 04:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
go right ahead
 
04:30:54.530 --> 04:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
um representative Sophie caitis
 
04:30:58.490 --> 04:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh this is hard on the the dairy farm
 
04:31:00.290 --> 04:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
support and I was just wondering how
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
04:31:05.210 --> 04:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
not terribly well for the most part and
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
you know I I was just looking at some
 
04:31:07.380 --> 04:31:09.010 align:start position:0%
you know I I was just looking at some
information

04:31:09.010 --> 04:31:09.020 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide again
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
that the number the production keeps
 
04:31:17.929 --> 04:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
increasing Nationwide which pushes
 
04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
the price of milk down because there is
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
an overproduction Nationwide
 
04:31:26.330 --> 04:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
many of our farmers and I think if you
 
04:31:26.340 --> 04:31:27.349 align:start position:0%
many of our farmers and I think if you
take

04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:31:31.010 --> 04:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
the four com the four governmental herds
 
04:31:33.050 --> 04:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
out of it there's there are two herds at
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
UNH Grafton county is the last County
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
with a herd and Alvar in high school my
 
04:31:42.110 --> 04:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
high school still has a small herd we're
 
04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
right around 65 commercial Dairy herds
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
um many of them are facing
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
challenges with aging out
 
04:31:56.689 --> 04:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
and there's no Next Generation the Farms
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
that are doing well and will survive are
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
the ones that have been Innovative and I
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
have been saying this long before I was
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner people have got to figure
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
out a way to Market directly
 
04:32:11.210 --> 04:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
to the consumers and you've got a few
 
04:32:14.090 --> 04:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
that are doing extremely well but
 
04:32:14.100 --> 04:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
that are doing extremely well but
um

04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:17.809 --> 04:32:17.819 align:start position:0%
I've said this for probably
 
04:32:20.210 --> 04:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
40 years Dairy Farmers are their own
 
04:32:22.090 --> 04:32:22.100 align:start position:0%
worst enemies
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
because they every time when the milk
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
prices go down well we have to produce
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
more milk when the milk prices are up
 
04:32:31.969 --> 04:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
well we have to produce more milk and
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
there isn't any type of
 
04:32:37.130 --> 04:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
ability to really control that but our
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
challenges are a little bit different
 
04:32:41.210 --> 04:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
because we have so few and so many next
 
04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
Generations we will always have dairy
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
farms I suspect but they'll be the ones
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
that are bottling their own milk and and
 
04:32:47.640 --> 04:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
that are bottling their own milk and and
selling

04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
selling
 
04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um directly and I and I hope some others
 
04:32:53.450 --> 04:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
start figuring out a way to do that I
 
04:32:55.250 --> 04:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
will continue to try to work to do that
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not I've not given up on New
 
04:32:59.649 --> 04:32:59.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's own idea but the pandemic
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
put a real crimp into that and other
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
things have interceded but we will get
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
back to working on that idea and see if
 
04:33:09.410 --> 04:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
we can do something to help thank you
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
question representative Bixby yes um so
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
a number of your department heads
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned things like we don't have the
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
resources for new measuring equipment or
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
new this or the new that I'm wondering
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
if that stuff has made it into your
 
04:33:28.131 --> 04:33:28.141 align:start position:0%
budget request and if there's a way that
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
we as a committee can help push the
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
finance committee to um well and that's
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
quite frankly representative Bixby and
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's why we
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
were given Direction by the governor as
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
to what we could request with the
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
parameters and that's why you know for
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.420 --> 04:33:52.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:52.609 --> 04:33:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:56.570 --> 04:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know our our actual needs without
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
being terribly greedy were
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
8.8 million but with the efficiency
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
budget it's 7.8 so there's a million
 
04:34:07.369 --> 04:34:07.379 align:start position:0%
dollars of need there that hopefully we
 
04:34:08.929 --> 04:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
will get
 
04:34:12.051 --> 04:34:12.061 align:start position:0%
um and the same is is true going forth
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
into uh fiscal uh 25. so
 
04:34:19.730 --> 04:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
you know certainly we're hopeful that
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
you can help us on that I'm also as I
 
04:34:24.730 --> 04:34:24.740 align:start position:0%
say trying to be
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
realistic about what we can request the
 
04:34:31.490 --> 04:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
way we develop the animal database is to
 
04:34:34.010 --> 04:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm not an I.T guy so I'm just
 
04:34:36.410 --> 04:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
saying we're leaving these doors open
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
so that eventually we can build the
 
04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
rooms on where the doors are
 
04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
without a great deal of additional
 
04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
um cost these are the things we're
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do and I will tell you quite
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
honestly you know while I know we have
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
more person I'll need we're not going to
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
be adequately able to assess exactly
 
04:34:56.529 --> 04:34:56.539 align:start position:0%
what those needs are until we get the it
 
04:34:58.849 --> 04:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
systems that we need and I appreciate
 
04:35:00.410 --> 04:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
your help
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
um in that in that process and we are we
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
are getting there oh
 
04:35:09.769 --> 04:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
so um I'm so with the I.T I I put the
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill in I'm hoping that the amount that
 
04:35:14.510 --> 04:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
you said you needed was actually as much
 
04:35:16.970 --> 04:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
as you really needed
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
um and uh I don't know if that's coming
 
04:35:21.051 --> 04:35:21.061 align:start position:0%
to this committee or if it's going to
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means or Finance it's that's
 
04:35:25.260 --> 04:35:26.269 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means or Finance it's that's
um

04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
that one is they haven't sent the bill
 
04:35:30.289 --> 04:35:30.299 align:start position:0%
out yet
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if there are other
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh items that
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
you are not able to fit into the budget
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
where some sort of legislation from this
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
committee May in fact uh help uh bridge
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
the gap or get things moving and I'm
 
04:35:50.330 --> 04:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
hoping that it's obviously too late to
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
get new bills in this year but I'm
 
04:35:54.051 --> 04:35:54.061 align:start position:0%
hoping that if something if things like
 
04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
that come up that you will be able to
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
touch base with us and make sure that we
 
04:36:00.650 --> 04:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
put in those requests for you I
 
04:36:02.330 --> 04:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and we are working with
 
04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
a number of house members and Senate
 
04:36:07.490 --> 04:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
members on some of the statutory changes
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
we need and would like to see but there
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
are you know those challenges and
 
04:36:14.570 --> 04:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
frankly one of the challenges we're
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
we're facing is space challenges Where
 
04:36:19.609 --> 04:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.890 --> 04:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
and if we get the Personnel we're going
 
04:36:26.570 --> 04:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
to be chock-a-block full however uh Des
 
04:36:29.529 --> 04:36:29.539 align:start position:0%
tells us we're going to be moving in May
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
within the same building but to a
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
temporary space and then someplace else
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable and I've informed
 
04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
the governor that the idea of
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
departments having to move twice
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
possibly three times is unacceptable
 
04:36:47.449 --> 04:36:47.459 align:start position:0%
which shut us down for weeks at a time
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to look at the possibility
 
04:36:52.849 --> 04:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
of us moving over to the insurance
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
complex there is a lot of space there
 
04:36:59.810 --> 04:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
where doj is going to I love being right
 
04:37:02.570 --> 04:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
here but the reality is if they expect
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
us if we're expected to move several
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
times they're going to put us in a in a
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
hole that's going to take us a long time
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
to get out of we've the last time I
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
think the department moved was sometime
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s and I have been trying
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
to utilize the space as best at best we
 
04:37:22.730 --> 04:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
can but we are bursting it at the seams
 
04:37:22.740 --> 04:37:24.289 align:start position:0%
can but we are bursting it at the seams
where

04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:37:26.449 --> 04:37:26.459 align:start position:0%
we are and so that's another thing that
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
I've had to be mindful of is how many
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
people can we put in this box that we're
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're currently in so
 
04:37:36.170 --> 04:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
we're making great I'm proud of the
 
04:37:38.510 --> 04:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
strides that we have have made and I
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
think we have been able to make the ones
 
04:37:41.890 --> 04:37:41.900 align:start position:0%
that we have because we have been
 
04:37:44.929 --> 04:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
realistic in what we've asked for I was
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
told on my first day on the job that the
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
department was constantly in triage I
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
really don't think we are in triage mode
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
all the time we're stressed but at least
 
04:38:00.250 --> 04:38:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh one second I know that we had
 
04:38:08.929 --> 04:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
scheduled uh Des to come in at 2 30. is
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:21.650 --> 04:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
um you can have them come in we'll have
 
04:38:25.849 --> 04:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
one last quick question and I think we
 
04:38:27.890 --> 04:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
got to wrap it up quick
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to come back anyway thank
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh we heard about a
 
04:38:34.189 --> 04:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
04:38:37.250 --> 04:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
um one-time Grant funded programs that
 
04:38:39.289 --> 04:38:39.299 align:start position:0%
sounded really great local food purchase
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
assistance program that obviously is a
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
win-win the local food for schools
 
04:38:45.051 --> 04:38:45.061 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement program so those
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
are one-time grants is are we looking is
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
there are there possible future federal
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
funds coming down the line are these
 
04:38:55.490 --> 04:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
programs simply going to go away what
 
04:38:57.170 --> 04:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
what are our hopes for the future of
 
04:38:59.150 --> 04:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
these programs those are excellent
 
04:39:01.609 --> 04:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
questions one of the things that I
 
04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
talked to director Marshall about in
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
this and some of them do a go for a
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
couple of years and we never know what
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
the feds are going to put out there for
 
04:39:08.760 --> 04:39:10.730 align:start position:0%
the feds are going to put out there for
funding

04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
but I I think it would be a real tragedy
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
if we developed these relationships and
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
then cut them off at the end of the
 
04:39:20.090 --> 04:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
funding so we will be looking at ways
 
04:39:22.730 --> 04:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
that we can can make these agreements
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
work going Beyond here because the food
 
04:39:27.529 --> 04:39:27.539 align:start position:0%
is still going to be needed so what can
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
we do to make sure that even if there
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
isn't a large degree of a large amount
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
of federal money or maybe even you know
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we get to get some State money but
 
04:39:40.270 --> 04:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do we want to see those
 
04:39:43.130 --> 04:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
relationships continue because
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know it could be devastating if the
 
04:39:47.208 --> 04:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
if Farmers have relied on those for a
 
04:39:48.830 --> 04:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years and then we cut them off
 
04:39:50.810 --> 04:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
like that that would could be the worst
 
04:39:53.330 --> 04:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
thing that we could do so my goal is to
 
04:39:55.788 --> 04:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to make them long-term
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.770 --> 04:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner Jasper I really
 
04:40:03.410 --> 04:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate you and your staff for coming
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%

your your educating us and keeping us
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
apprised of all the programs and work
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
and diligence that you have all put
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
through so we we look forward to seeing

for your presence thank you we
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being our audience today
 
04:40:29.690 --> 04:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
we get to tell our story and we don't
 
04:40:31.850 --> 04:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
get to do that I think often enough and
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
I think we have a great story to tell so
 
04:40:36.650 --> 04:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:40:41.330 --> 04:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
so next up um we have the Department of
 
04:40:45.050 --> 04:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I believe Ms
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
Sarah U.S Kern is here oh there you are
 
04:40:47.878 --> 04:40:49.788 align:start position:0%

door in a few minutes unless somebody
 
04:47:23.208 --> 04:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
wants to talk to me but I'm available
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
anytime if anybody would like to talk
 
04:47:28.430 --> 04:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll say generally for the agency
 
04:47:28.440 --> 04:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll say generally for the agency
are

04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
some of the things that are taking up a
 
04:47:34.730 --> 04:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
lot of our time right now are moving we
 
04:47:37.730 --> 04:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
have a lot of funding between arpa funds
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
for the state we had 185 million dollars
 
04:47:43.010 --> 04:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
moved to us for uh water Wastewater and
 
04:47:47.690 --> 04:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
Dam projects uh the bill infrastructure
 
04:47:51.288 --> 04:47:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh law moved a lot of money to us over
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
the next five years so we have
 
04:47:56.448 --> 04:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
unprecedented amounts of uh work and the
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
good news is money for the local
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
communities for water and wastewater
 
04:48:01.368 --> 04:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
systems that that takes a lot of our
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
time and will as we move forward uh and
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
obviously uh nobody can read the
 
04:48:08.448 --> 04:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
newspaper without hearing about
 
04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
different forms of water contamination
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
so those are really among the the normal
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
day-to-day things which you'll hear a
 
04:48:17.570 --> 04:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
lot about today those are things of late
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
taking up a lot of the agency's time and
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
and focus so with that unless there's
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions from me I will uh I'll leave
 
04:48:25.970 --> 04:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
you to the good hands of the waste
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
management division but uh Madam chair I
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if you had any anything for
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee no um well
 
04:48:33.480 --> 04:48:36.890 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee no um well
representative

04:48:36.890 --> 04:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you director
 
04:48:40.490 --> 04:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:48:41.810 --> 04:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that there was money
 
04:48:45.050 --> 04:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
for the uh for dams in the state I was
 
04:48:46.910 --> 04:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
wondering specifically about Silver Lake
 
04:48:49.368 --> 04:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
if you had any funding for that are you
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
working on that in conjunction with the
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners at Belknap sure we
 
04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
have been in contact with the County
 
04:48:56.330 --> 04:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I know for for Silver Lake
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
which is Downstream actually there's
 
04:48:59.448 --> 04:48:59.458 align:start position:0%
more than one Silver Lake in the state
 
04:49:02.448 --> 04:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
which I find interesting uh which is
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
Downstream of uh our Lakeport Dam uh
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is at the uh near Lake arabesaki
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's a an area where we've had some
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
issues with the property owners on the
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh on the
 
04:49:20.510 --> 04:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
the water body if you will and and it's
 
04:49:22.368 --> 04:49:22.378 align:start position:0%
somewhat hard to control depending on
 
04:49:25.128 --> 04:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
the with flooding so uh the County
 
04:49:26.810 --> 04:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have some money they were
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
they've been talking about moving uh to
 
04:49:31.850 --> 04:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
do a study uh there's been a there was a
 
04:49:33.770 --> 04:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
study done I think in the 1980s I think
 
04:49:35.330 --> 04:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
by the Army Corps of Engineers that
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
would all have to be redone so I'm not
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
sure where they are the last feel I got
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
from them is that they weren't inclined
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
to move ahead but that's the discussion
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
between you know the people there uh
 
04:49:46.500 --> 04:49:47.690 align:start position:0%
between you know the people there uh
ma'am

04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh yes
 
04:49:51.890 --> 04:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
um I know that there were discussions
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
with Des back as far as 2012 when the
 
04:49:58.368 --> 04:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
constituency of that uh late came to Des
 
04:50:01.970 --> 04:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
and that this has been an ongoing issue
 
04:50:05.090 --> 04:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and for the county to take it solely
 
04:50:05.100 --> 04:50:05.868 align:start position:0%
um and for the county to take it solely
on

04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:50:07.550 --> 04:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
um when like I said it's been going on
 
04:50:10.368 --> 04:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
for almost a decade uh with Des I'm just
 
04:50:14.090 --> 04:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
wondering uh if for some reason we don't
 
04:50:17.208 --> 04:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
do the study what will Des do
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh short answer is is nothing so so
 
04:50:21.770 --> 04:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
there's enabling enabling Bill allowing
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
for Dam to be built and money to be
 
04:50:25.550 --> 04:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated without appropriating money
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
as you're aware so the steps to be
 
04:50:29.570 --> 04:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
taking for this or any other Dam like
 
04:50:31.730 --> 04:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
that would be a study to be done and
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'll be very clear that it's not an easy
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
thing because in order for that Dam to
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
be built over a mile and a half for the
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River would have to be
 
04:50:41.570 --> 04:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
dredged and then periodically dredged as
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
it back you know the silts in and that
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
that in itself I'm not sure would be
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
approval but the Army Corps of Engineers
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
but assuming all that the study would
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
need to be put in place and then
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
to this body for the capital budget
 
04:50:56.690 --> 04:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
moving forward somebody has to put in
 
04:50:59.330 --> 04:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
for that money to be done for the the
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
capital project of building the dam
 
04:51:02.690 --> 04:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
doing the dredging so that would be a
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
multi-step process none of that will
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
happen without the first step of that
 
04:51:06.240 --> 04:51:07.730 align:start position:0%
happen without the first step of that
study

04:51:07.730 --> 04:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:51:09.530 --> 04:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it you're
 
04:51:09.540 --> 04:51:12.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it you're
welcome

04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%

Division and what I thought I would do
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
is give you a brief overview of how our
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
division is organized and our primary
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and then we'll have a
 
04:51:57.050 --> 04:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
presentation from each of our Bureau
 
04:51:59.150 --> 04:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
administrators and so that they can give
 
04:52:01.250 --> 04:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
you more details on the programs of
 
04:52:03.770 --> 04:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
their bureaus we also have another
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
colleague from Des here with us today
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
Anthony druin from the biosolids program
 
04:52:12.010 --> 04:52:12.020 align:start position:0%
Anthony could you wave
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
the biosolids program actually resides
 
04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
in our Water Division not the waste
 
04:52:18.650 --> 04:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
management division but we know that
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
bills from that program tend to come
 
04:52:23.448 --> 04:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
before your committee so we wanted to
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to meet Anthony as
 
04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
well he will does not have a
 
04:52:29.330 --> 04:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
presentation prepared for today but he
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
can certainly answer questions at the
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
end and also is happy to to meet
 
04:52:34.080 --> 04:52:36.250 align:start position:0%
end and also is happy to to meet
everyone

04:52:36.250 --> 04:52:36.260 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
we have worked in time for questions at
 
04:52:41.690 --> 04:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
the end of our presentation so if it
 
04:52:43.550 --> 04:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
would please the chair and the committee
 
04:52:45.890 --> 04:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
I suggest that we hold questions until
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
after all the bureau administrators have
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
spoken about their programs
 
04:52:52.730 --> 04:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so the waste management
 
04:52:55.490 --> 04:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
division is organized into five bureaus
 
04:52:57.890 --> 04:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
we have the oil remediation and
 
04:53:00.530 --> 04:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
compliance Bureau which focuses on
 
04:53:02.990 --> 04:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
proper management of petroleum products
 
04:53:04.850 --> 04:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
to prevent them from being released into
 
04:53:06.190 --> 04:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
04:53:09.288 --> 04:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
they do emergency response when spills
 
04:53:12.550 --> 04:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
occur and they oversee longer term
 
04:53:15.368 --> 04:53:15.378 align:start position:0%
investigation and Remediation of
 
04:53:17.690 --> 04:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
petroleum-contaminated sites where where
 
04:53:19.550 --> 04:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
larger or longer term spills have
 
04:53:19.560 --> 04:53:20.930 align:start position:0%
larger or longer term spills have
happened

04:53:20.930 --> 04:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:53:22.970 --> 04:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
they also have programs to provide
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
financial assistance for cleaning up
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
petroleum contamination
 
04:53:28.910 --> 04:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
we also have a hazardous waste
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau and they focus on
 
04:53:33.170 --> 04:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
cleaning up properties that have been
 
04:53:35.448 --> 04:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
contaminated with hazardous waste and
 
04:53:37.490 --> 04:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants and our
 
04:53:40.690 --> 04:53:40.700 align:start position:0%
brownfields program which revitalizes
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
underutilized contaminated properties to
 
04:53:45.650 --> 04:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
bring them back into productive use also
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
resides within our hazardous waste
 
04:53:49.250 --> 04:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
our hazardous waste management and Solid
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
Waste Management bureaus they do similar
 
04:53:58.250 --> 04:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
things they both help to ensure the
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
proper management of hazardous waste and
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
solid waste by providing training to the
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
folks who handle those types of waste by
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
providing technical assistance
 
04:54:11.150 --> 04:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
compliance assurance and permitting
 
04:54:14.690 --> 04:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
and our mtbe remediation Bureau is our
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
fifth Bureau and what they do is a lot
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
more than mtbe remediation actually the
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
mtbe remediation Bureau focuses on
 
04:54:25.490 --> 04:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
um providing remedies for contaminated
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
water supplies and specifically water
 
04:54:31.128 --> 04:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
supplies that are contaminated by mtbe
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
and perfluorinated contamination
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
and our drinking water and groundwater
 
04:54:39.530 --> 04:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
trust fund program and our pfas response
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
program both reside within the mtbe
 
04:54:44.810 --> 04:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
so all of the work that we do is all
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
about protecting human health and the
 
04:54:50.750 --> 04:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
environment through all the programs
 
04:54:52.850 --> 04:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
that I briefly described to you we
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to include a slide that shows our
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
primary responsibilities but I touched
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
on those already and our Bureau
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
administrators are going to be providing
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
more detail on them so I think we'll
 
04:55:03.770 --> 04:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
just get started with the bureau
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
administrators so first we have Bob
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
Bishop from the oil remediation and
 
04:55:13.550 --> 04:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Bob Bishop I'm
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the oil remediation
 
04:55:21.530 --> 04:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
and compliance Bureau and we are
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
everything petroleum within the state
 
04:55:25.730 --> 04:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
all right we have different sections
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
within the bureau that really worked
 
04:55:29.340 --> 04:55:30.288 align:start position:0%
within the bureau that really worked
together

04:55:30.288 --> 04:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:55:33.770 --> 04:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
the UST and AST permitting regulates the
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
storage of petroleum and for underground
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
storage tanks also other hazardous
 
04:55:39.120 --> 04:55:40.670 align:start position:0%
storage tanks also other hazardous
substances

04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
substances
 
04:55:44.530 --> 04:55:44.540 align:start position:0%
that strives to keep the the materials
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
in contained in good shape and really
 
04:55:52.010 --> 04:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
being a good Steward of the materials
 
04:55:54.530 --> 04:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
accidents happen they do get out at
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
times or they have in the past before we
 
04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
had a strong program to regulate the
 
04:56:01.490 --> 04:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
storage of of these items
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
and then our spill response program
 
04:56:07.128 --> 04:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
comes into play so we we have one
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
program designed to keep it locked up
 
04:56:14.208 --> 04:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
another program to react and to respond
 
04:56:17.208 --> 04:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
to the spills to ensure that we protect
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
human health and the environment and
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
have the get those spills cleaned up
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
we then have petroleum spill
 
04:56:27.770 --> 04:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
investigation and Remediation program
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
petroleum remediation section and so
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
when that spill does happen and if
 
04:56:34.850 --> 04:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
there's any residual that needs to be
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
addressed that program addresses those
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
residual petroleum contaminants
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the oil discharge
 
04:56:46.250 --> 04:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
and Disposal cleanup fund and this is an
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
excess Insurance Fund that assists those
 
04:56:52.250 --> 04:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
who have had spills with having them
 
04:56:54.288 --> 04:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
cleaned up appropriately
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'll go through each section
 
04:56:55.680 --> 04:56:57.230 align:start position:0%
I'll go through each section
individually

04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
individually
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
and starting here with our spoon
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
response and complaint investigation
 
04:57:04.730 --> 04:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
section we respond to about 300 spills
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
per year and these spills are from a
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
whole host of different categories
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
probably half of them are Transportation
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
related about 150 of them a year
 
04:57:22.128 --> 04:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
um 90 to 100 come from
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
tank systems uh the majority of those
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
are home heating oil tank systems so
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
those tank systems that are regulated
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
under our compliance program
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
we really don't see releases from those
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
our program is on call 24 hours a day
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
seven days a week 365 days a year they
 
04:57:51.288 --> 04:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
are called into action almost almost
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
every day to go respond to a spill
 
04:57:57.170 --> 04:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
primarily the spills are petroleum
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
spills but 95 then we have some other
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials or even uh
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
other materials that wouldn't be
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials like milk that can
 
04:58:08.930 --> 04:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
cause a big problem when a tanker truck
 
04:58:11.208 --> 04:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
rolls over and Spills its spills the
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
milk into a ditch and it turns into a
 
04:58:15.050 --> 04:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
yogurt and that's not very good for the
 
04:58:17.690 --> 04:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
environment either
 
04:58:19.730 --> 04:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
you can see in these photos here the
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
photo on the left is from a home heating
 
04:58:25.550 --> 04:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
oil spill it's dyed red that is home
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
heating oil and then on the right is a
 
04:58:31.550 --> 04:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
photo from one of our Coastal facilities
 
04:58:33.948 --> 04:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
and primarily what you're seeing there
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
is the eversource power plant facility
 
04:58:39.170 --> 04:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
but along the piscata core River the
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
scottoqua river we have over 100 million
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
gallons of petroleum petroleum storage
 
04:58:48.050 --> 04:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
so it's a real Focus for us in the
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
coastal region to respond to spills and
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
to be prepared in case the spill happens
 
04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
along the river and that leads into the
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
Great Bay Estuary which is is a very
 
04:59:01.610 --> 04:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
sensitive environmental resource and
 
04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
we're well aware of that and we take a
 
04:59:06.410 --> 04:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
lot of steps to protect that resource
 
04:59:10.850 --> 04:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
and to protect the River Community
 
04:59:13.490 --> 04:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh that involves partnering with other
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
agencies we partner with the Coast Guard
 
04:59:18.770 --> 04:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
we partner with Maine dep uh the the
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
Naval Yard we have numerous agreements
 
04:59:24.970 --> 04:59:24.980 align:start position:0%
with them in order to be able to respond
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
effectively and quickly to any emergency
 
04:59:31.010 --> 04:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
that happens in that region
 
04:59:33.110 --> 04:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
the section that does spill response
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
also investigates complaints and these
 
04:59:38.690 --> 04:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
are complaints of disposal of materials
 
04:59:41.690 --> 04:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
spilled materials whether they are
 
04:59:44.930 --> 04:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
hazardous material hazardous waste Solid
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
Waste or petroleum spills and they do
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
about 40 to 60 complaint investigations
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
a year
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
our hazardous waste management Bureau
 
04:59:56.090 --> 04:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
and our Solid Waste Management Bureau
 
04:59:58.128 --> 04:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
are primarily responsible
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
compliance at facilities that are
 
05:00:04.730 --> 05:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
designed to manage those materials so
 
05:00:07.010 --> 05:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
these complaints are at facilities that
 
05:00:09.890 --> 05:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
are not designed or at locations not
 
05:00:12.590 --> 05:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
designed to manage those materials
 
05:00:14.930 --> 05:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
kind of illegal dumping if you think of
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
or oil compliance section this is our
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
com our section that regulates storage
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
tanks above ground storage tanks and
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks for
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks we have a
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
specific statute that provides the
 
05:00:34.128 --> 05:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority and this is for
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous substances and petroleum
 
05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
we have about 40 million gallons of
 
05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
materials stored in underground storage
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
tanks in New Hampshire
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
above ground storage tanks that number
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
is about 156 million so we're looking at
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
close to 200 million gallons of
 
05:00:56.090 --> 05:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
petroleum primarily petroleum products
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
stored in regulated systems within New
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire earlier I mentioned the home
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
heating oil tanks we don't regulate
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
the work of the oil compliance section
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
for underground storage tanks it's
 
05:01:14.330 --> 05:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
petroleum and hazardous materials they
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
inspect those tanks every three years
 
05:01:21.050 --> 05:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
they also that section reviews designs
 
05:01:23.810 --> 05:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
of of new systems and systems that are
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
being upgraded or substantially modified
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
we did 44 design reviews in the last
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
05:01:32.930 --> 05:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
we also do construction inspection so
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
any facility that is going through that
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
design review process gets inspected
 
05:01:39.050 --> 05:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
before it
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
stores these materials
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
this program is what we call EPA
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
authorized so it actually works in lieu
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the EPA program and the EPA
 
05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
regulations they've authorized the state
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to regulate underground
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
storage tanks
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
we have an operator certification
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
program as well that is designed to
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
provide training to those operators of
 
05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks above ground
 
05:02:09.890 --> 05:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
storage tanks those are regulated under
 
05:02:12.050 --> 05:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
a different statute it's the same
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
statute that applies to our oil spills
 
05:02:20.330 --> 05:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
and this is a very similar system where
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
we do inspections of the above ground
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
storage tanks and we have design review
 
05:02:28.030 --> 05:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
that happens last year there were 18
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
plans for new installations that were
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
submitted and reviewed and with those
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
plans we also do construction
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
inspections before those go into into
 
05:02:36.480 --> 05:02:39.948 align:start position:0%
inspections before those go into into
operation

05:02:39.948 --> 05:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.250 --> 05:02:42.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned the
 
05:02:46.250 --> 05:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
section that addresses oil spills and
 
05:02:48.410 --> 05:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
these are for the more long term so this
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
is after emergency response has occurred
 
05:02:54.890 --> 05:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
and this section does investigation of
 
05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
spills the remediation and the long-term
 
05:03:00.770 --> 05:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
monitoring of groundwater that's been
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
impacted by those spills
 
05:03:07.970 --> 05:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
we have about 1100 active sites
 
05:03:10.970 --> 05:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
currently that we are managing looking
 
05:03:14.530 --> 05:03:14.540 align:start position:0%
and actively remediating cleaning up
 
05:03:17.208 --> 05:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
monitoring to see the natural decay of
 
05:03:19.550 --> 05:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
any contaminants that may be in that
 
05:03:23.208 --> 05:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
groundwater we really focus on human
 
05:03:25.970 --> 05:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
health and Water Resources so the
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
groundwater is is of particular concern
 
05:03:32.448 --> 05:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
within this program last year this
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
program at 131 sites that were closed
 
05:03:38.090 --> 05:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
there were 90 new sites that came in as
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
I mentioned before 84 of those were from
 
05:03:43.490 --> 05:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
those home heating oil tanks so those
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
tanks that we are actually regulating
 
05:03:47.628 --> 05:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
through our above ground and underground
 
05:03:50.570 --> 05:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
storage tank system or compliance
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
section those tanks we haven't been
 
05:03:56.690 --> 05:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
seeing releases from uh those tanks have
 
05:03:59.930 --> 05:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
been in good shape going back to the 80s
 
05:04:02.510 --> 05:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
when we required double walled system in
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
the early 90s when the piping had to be
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:10.730 --> 05:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
and then finally we have our fund
 
05:04:13.368 --> 05:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
management section and this section
 
05:04:16.490 --> 05:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
oversees the oil disposal and discharge
 
05:04:18.650 --> 05:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
fund I mentioned at the beginning this
 
05:04:21.050 --> 05:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
is an excess Insurance Fund so this fund
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
provides money Beyond Insurance when
 
05:04:25.368 --> 05:04:25.378 align:start position:0%
either insurance has run out or
 
05:04:28.368 --> 05:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
insurance is not in place to help pay
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the cleanup of these petroleum
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
contaminated sites
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
many of the sites are are older Legacy
 
05:04:36.890 --> 05:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
sites that we've been dealing with for a
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
while from that previous generation of
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
tank systems that was in place with
 
05:04:45.128 --> 05:04:45.138 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
this fund is available strictly for
 
05:04:51.410 --> 05:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
corrective action so that is the removal
 
05:04:53.930 --> 05:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
of soil removal of contaminants treating
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the groundwater and the continued
 
05:04:59.448 --> 05:04:59.458 align:start position:0%
monitoring of groundwater
 
05:05:03.890 --> 05:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
it has funded over 4 000 cleanups since
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
its Inception and over 3 300 of those
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
cleanups are complete at this time since
 
05:05:09.718 --> 05:05:11.628 align:start position:0%
cleanups are complete at this time since
1988.

05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
1988.
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
this also provides Financial Assurance
 
05:05:15.850 --> 05:05:15.860 align:start position:0%
which is part of the federal
 
05:05:18.170 --> 05:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
requirements for underground storage
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
tank systems that they have Financial
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
Assurance so that say your gas station
 
05:05:24.770 --> 05:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
that goes into the corner they have to
 
05:05:24.780 --> 05:05:26.030 align:start position:0%
that goes into the corner they have to
have

05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:05:26.040 --> 05:05:27.230 align:start position:0%
have
a

05:05:27.230 --> 05:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:05:29.930 --> 05:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
mechanism in order to be able to clean
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
up any spill that may happen
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
along with this it supports what we call
 
05:05:37.970 --> 05:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
our safe tank program this program
 
05:05:41.868 --> 05:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
provides home heating oil tanks to lower
 
05:05:41.878 --> 05:05:43.368 align:start position:0%
provides home heating oil tanks to lower
income

05:05:43.368 --> 05:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
citizens within New Hampshire it's a
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
method that we have to try to address
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
the home heating oil issue to get to
 
05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
those tanks before they release and
 
05:05:57.050 --> 05:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
replace them if with new tanks in
 
05:05:58.810 --> 05:05:58.820 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
individuals may not have the means to do
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.350 --> 05:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's my last slide and I'll
 
05:06:08.330 --> 05:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
take questions at the end of the full
 
05:06:11.868 --> 05:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you thanks Bob and
 
05:06:13.850 --> 05:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
next we have Jeffrey Martz the
 
05:06:16.010 --> 05:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Hazardous Waste
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
05:06:24.410 --> 05:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee for having us today uh as
 
05:06:25.970 --> 05:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
Sarah mentioned my name is Jeff Martz
 
05:06:27.530 --> 05:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator the Hazardous
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
Waste remediation Bureau and our Bureau
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
has uh oversight of investigation and
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
Remediation of hazardous waste sites so
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
that that mainly includes all of the
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
contamination besides petroleum that has
 
05:06:44.208 --> 05:06:44.218 align:start position:0%
gotten into soil and groundwater my
 
05:06:46.490 --> 05:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
Bureau is divided into two sections we
 
05:06:48.770 --> 05:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
have state site section in our federal
 
05:06:50.448 --> 05:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
sites section and the federal site
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
section has two subsections that include
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
super fund and Department of Defense
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
sites and our Bureau has about 24 staff
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
members most of which are engineers and
 
05:07:03.650 --> 05:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists many of whom have
 
05:07:05.570 --> 05:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
professional certifications in their
 
05:07:07.970 --> 05:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
respective fields
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
our state light our state lead section
 
05:07:13.010 --> 05:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
has 14 positions that manage
 
05:07:15.650 --> 05:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
collectively about 800 sites located
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
across the state and they're
 
05:07:20.050 --> 05:07:20.060 align:start position:0%
investigating uh
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
overseeing remedial action and
 
05:07:24.530 --> 05:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
monitoring long-term monitoring
 
05:07:26.208 --> 05:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
amenities sites where groundwater can
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
remains contaminated
 
05:07:30.910 --> 05:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of sites includes about
 
05:07:37.490 --> 05:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
612 hazardous waste sites 180 solid
 
05:07:41.208 --> 05:07:41.218 align:start position:0%
um closed landfills that are unlined and
 
05:07:43.610 --> 05:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
then there are six Active landfills in
 
05:07:45.650 --> 05:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
the state that are managed by the state
 
05:07:49.368 --> 05:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
site section and our section is divided
 
05:07:51.890 --> 05:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
up into three subsections which include
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
the emerging contaminant group and five
 
05:07:57.730 --> 05:07:57.740 align:start position:0%
staff in this group mainly focus on
 
05:08:01.128 --> 05:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants such as pfas so
 
05:08:02.930 --> 05:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
for example the saint Cobain site
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
investigation is managed by one of the
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
staff members in the emerging
 
05:08:06.360 --> 05:08:07.810 align:start position:0%
staff members in the emerging
contaminant

05:08:07.810 --> 05:08:07.820 align:start position:0%
contaminant
 
05:08:11.090 --> 05:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
group now it's important to note that a
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
lot of our sites cross over between
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
these groups so we have sort of some
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
fluid lines between them but the
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminant group has expertise
 
05:08:22.730 --> 05:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
and continual professional development
 
05:08:24.530 --> 05:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
in the field of emerging contaminants
 
05:08:25.550 --> 05:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of new science
 
05:08:28.730 --> 05:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
constantly coming out on this topic
 
05:08:30.530 --> 05:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
next we have our brownfields program
 
05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
consisting of three staff and the main
 
05:08:36.128 --> 05:08:36.138 align:start position:0%
goal there is to obtain funding to
 
05:08:38.690 --> 05:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
transform underutilized properties back
 
05:08:40.250 --> 05:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
into beneficial use and I'll talk a
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
little more about that on the next slide
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
and then we have our groundwater
 
05:08:45.650 --> 05:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
remediation and permanent Group which
 
05:08:47.448 --> 05:08:47.458 align:start position:0%
consists of five staff that primarily
 
05:08:50.650 --> 05:08:50.660 align:start position:0%
focus on landfills both the active and
 
05:08:53.448 --> 05:08:53.458 align:start position:0%
inactive as well as the release
 
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
detection monitoring so if you had a
 
05:08:58.850 --> 05:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
lined Lagoon we require certain
 
05:09:00.530 --> 05:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
monitoring activities to make sure that
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
that liner is operating properly and not
 
05:09:05.810 --> 05:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
contaminating groundwater
 
05:09:07.310 --> 05:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
so I just want to highlight some of the
 
05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
recent activity in our brownfields
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
program so our brownfields cleanup Grant
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
competition is about to award two
 
05:09:16.670 --> 05:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to the Bri
 
05:09:19.368 --> 05:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
Development LLC for cleanup work at the
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
Sinclair Hotel Site in Bethlehem and
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
then we have a two hundred thousand
 
05:09:25.850 --> 05:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
dollar award for the city of Franklin
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
for cleanup work at the Stanley Mill
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
site in Franklin
 
05:09:33.410 --> 05:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
and HDs was recently awarded 2 million
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
EPA Brownfield assessment grant for a
 
05:09:39.170 --> 05:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
five-year period so that's a significant
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
influx of money for brownfields and
 
05:09:45.530 --> 05:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
we're also awaiting final word on a 790
 
05:09:48.170 --> 05:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
000 EPA Brownfield State response
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
program grant for 2023 pursuant to the
 
05:09:54.770 --> 05:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:56.330 --> 05:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
so now I'm switching from our state
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
sites to the federal state section and
 
05:10:01.610 --> 05:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
specifically in Superfund we have five
 
05:10:04.970 --> 05:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
staff members that work on 22 New
 
05:10:07.310 --> 05:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Superfund sites these sites
 
05:10:09.050 --> 05:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
are managed in conjunction with the U.S
 
05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
EPA and they're divided into two groups
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
we have uh fund lead sites which receive
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
funding primarily from either the EPA or
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
the state and then there are PRP or
 
05:10:22.670 --> 05:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
potentially responsible party-led sites
 
05:10:24.410 --> 05:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
where the polluter is paying directly
 
05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
for investigation and cleanup of those
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
types of sites so by the Numbers we have
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
eight fund lead sites in the state 11
 
05:10:34.368 --> 05:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
PRP or potentially responsible party
 
05:10:37.570 --> 05:10:37.580 align:start position:0%
sites one combination PRP and fund lead
 
05:10:41.208 --> 05:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
which is the Savage well 1D listed site
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
which is the Londonderry Town garage and
 
05:10:45.288 --> 05:10:45.298 align:start position:0%
one proposed for listing which is the
 
05:10:49.368 --> 05:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:52.610 --> 05:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
also in our federal sites section is the
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense sites where we
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
have two positions that address six DOD
 
05:11:00.530 --> 05:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
or Department of Defense sites but don't
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
let the numbers fool you uh one of those
 
05:11:05.090 --> 05:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
sites includes the peas trade Port that
 
05:11:08.090 --> 05:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
has over 100 individual uh areas of
 
05:11:10.128 --> 05:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
concern that are being addressed so
 
05:11:12.410 --> 05:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
essentially 100 individual sites at peas
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and some of those sites are are
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
quite significant
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
and finally there are 25 thuds or
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
formally used defense sites so these
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
could include everything from the peas
 
05:11:25.368 --> 05:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
trade port to Revolutionary War musket
 
05:11:28.010 --> 05:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
Fields where musket drills were held so
 
05:11:29.570 --> 05:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
it really kind of spans the gamut in a
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
lot of interesting history
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
but just want to include those uh for
 
05:11:33.600 --> 05:11:34.970 align:start position:0%
but just want to include those uh for
reference

05:11:34.970 --> 05:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
reference
 
05:11:36.770 --> 05:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll pass it on to Matt
 
05:11:36.780 --> 05:11:39.170 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll pass it on to Matt
Taylor

05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:41.208 --> 05:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
Matt Taylor's the administrator of our
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:47.810 --> 05:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes my name is Matt
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
Taylor and I am the minister of the MTB
 
05:11:53.208 --> 05:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau we have three basic
 
05:11:55.788 --> 05:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
main uh sections within the group we
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
have what is our uh MTB settlement funds
 
05:12:00.288 --> 05:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
our drinking water
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the drinking water and groundwater
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund and then our pfas response
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
under our MTB of settlement funds we do
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh sampling of drinking water within the
 
05:12:13.970 --> 05:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
state since 2014 we have sampled over 12
 
05:12:16.788 --> 05:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
000 private residents homes
 
05:12:16.798 --> 05:12:17.810 align:start position:0%
000 private residents homes
um

05:12:17.810 --> 05:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:19.730 --> 05:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
well we also do site investigation and
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
Remediation primarily that has been
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
Source removal and water line extensions
 
05:12:27.288 --> 05:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
fund Administration is uh separate from
 
05:12:31.730 --> 05:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
the MTB settlement funds
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
that concentrates on the protection
 
05:12:34.970 --> 05:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
preservation enhancement of drinking
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater resources in the
 
05:12:39.050 --> 05:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
state there is a 19-member advisory
 
05:12:41.330 --> 05:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
commission where we take old proposals
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
to them for decision making in 2022 we
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
funded 23 drinking water infrastructure
 
05:12:49.970 --> 05:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
projects totaling about 8.8 million in
 
05:12:52.970 --> 05:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
Grants 9.7 million in loans
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
we also had six Source water protection
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
projects Source water protection is when
 
05:12:59.570 --> 05:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
we provide funding so they can purchase
 
05:13:02.208 --> 05:13:02.218 align:start position:0%
land that is around a Wellhead to
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
provide a buffer so there was 1.5
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
million in Grants protecting 370 acres
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
of land
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
and finally we have our pfas response
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
which is coordinated by Amy Russo this
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh is the study investigation and
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
testing for contamination caused by the
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
plural ordinated chemicals Miss Riso is
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
the point of contact much of this study
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
and research is done by other divisions
 
05:13:28.128 --> 05:13:28.138 align:start position:0%
bureaus and so forth but she Remains the
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
point of contact for the Department
 
05:13:32.810 --> 05:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
also uh within that section we have the
 
05:13:35.570 --> 05:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
pfas rebate program this is a rebate
 
05:13:37.250 --> 05:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
program for private homeowners this
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
provides five thousand dollars for a
 
05:13:40.490 --> 05:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
treatment system at the home or ten
 
05:13:42.050 --> 05:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a connection to an
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
existing water line the perfect
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
reference is to have a water line so we
 
05:13:48.110 --> 05:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
also have the pfas loan and grant
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
program which provides funding for the
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Matt
 
05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
and next we have Leah McKenna the
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
administrator of our Solid Waste
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.750 --> 05:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
05:14:10.430 --> 05:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Leah McKenna
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
and I am the administrator of the solid
 
05:14:13.550 --> 05:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
waste management Bureau and excited to
 
05:14:14.690 --> 05:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
spend just a couple of minutes with you
 
05:14:16.430 --> 05:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
today to talk about what our program
 
05:14:16.440 --> 05:14:17.330 align:start position:0%
today to talk about what our program
does

05:14:17.330 --> 05:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:14:20.330 --> 05:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
so on the first slide well let me back
 
05:14:22.368 --> 05:14:22.378 align:start position:0%
up in the last couple of years
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
um we've probably picked up a paper or
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
read one of the online articles dealing
 
05:14:29.090 --> 05:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
with Solid Waste Management the topic is
 
05:14:31.490 --> 05:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
definitely been on the in the Forefront
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
of news media and the general public and
 
05:14:36.890 --> 05:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature so after a prolonged
 
05:14:38.930 --> 05:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
period of time where the program was
 
05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
very very very resource deficient we
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
were able to achieve a bit of a
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
reorganization of the program and the
 
05:14:49.490 --> 05:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
addition of two uh new positions
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the last year we have mostly filled
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
the positions in the bureau we're proud
 
05:14:57.530 --> 05:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
to say that we have uh 16 16 folks in
 
05:15:00.770 --> 05:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
our Bureau and I'll go into uh sort of
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
how our Bureau is is laid out so we have
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
four sections within the bureau our
 
05:15:06.890 --> 05:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
first listed is the engineering and
 
05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
permitting section and they are
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for permitting Solid Waste
 
05:15:11.520 --> 05:15:12.610 align:start position:0%
responsible for permitting Solid Waste
facilities

05:15:12.610 --> 05:15:12.620 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
they deal with compliance of active
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
facilities ensuring that they are
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
submitting all the reports on time that
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
they need to submit and they work with
 
05:15:23.208 --> 05:15:23.218 align:start position:0%
applicants to ensure that the submittals
 
05:15:26.050 --> 05:15:26.060 align:start position:0%
for applications for for new facilities
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
contain all the information that are
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
required in order for our department to
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
make decisions on permitting those
 
05:15:32.400 --> 05:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
make decisions on permitting those
facilities

05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:15:35.090 --> 05:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
next we have the compliance Assurance
 
05:15:35.100 --> 05:15:36.110 align:start position:0%
next we have the compliance Assurance
section

05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
so the engineering and permitting
 
05:15:39.410 --> 05:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
section we have five staff in compliance
 
05:15:42.170 --> 05:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
Assurance also has five staff we are
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
currently building a uh an inspection
 
05:15:47.690 --> 05:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
program whereby we enter and inspect
 
05:15:49.368 --> 05:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste facilities and ensure
 
05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
compliance with the multitude of rules
 
05:15:55.150 --> 05:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
in the statute that oversees our program
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
they we also an arm of that section
 
05:16:03.770 --> 05:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
assists Us in rule writing and conducts
 
05:16:06.590 --> 05:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions when warranted
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
next we have the reporting information
 
05:16:10.368 --> 05:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
financial management section a strong
 
05:16:13.010 --> 05:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
section of one and a half and they are
 
05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing a small number
 
05:16:18.170 --> 05:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
of grants that are
 
05:16:21.170 --> 05:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
um are doled out to a couple of uh
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
landfills and incinerators that are
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
going through closure activities
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
um lastly and and uh and newestly we
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
have the materials management education
 
05:16:33.288 --> 05:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
and planning section and as I mentioned
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
during the reorg the reorganization of
 
05:16:37.850 --> 05:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
the program we added a couple of new
 
05:16:39.288 --> 05:16:39.298 align:start position:0%
staff but we also added a new program
 
05:16:42.410 --> 05:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
and it's our planning program the solid
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
waste management Bureau has not had a
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
planning arm in well over a decade and
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
so we're very pleased to um to have
 
05:16:51.288 --> 05:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
three folks in that in that section and
 
05:16:53.090 --> 05:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
we have Mike Nork here with us and he is
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator of that materials
 
05:16:56.448 --> 05:16:56.458 align:start position:0%
management education and planning
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
section and we thought there might be
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions for for him so so he's here
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
so we are um our program is duly
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
authorized under the RSA 149m the solid
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
waste management statute
 
05:17:13.440 --> 05:17:14.090 align:start position:0%
waste management statute
um

05:17:14.090 --> 05:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:15.830 --> 05:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to just sort of lay the
 
05:17:18.050 --> 05:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
groundwork of what solid waste is and
 
05:17:19.850 --> 05:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
some of the the definition of solid
 
05:17:21.890 --> 05:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
waste is just as important of what it
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
isn't as what it is
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and so the definition of Statute of
 
05:17:28.730 --> 05:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
of solid waste does not include
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste or yard waste bodies of
 
05:17:34.128 --> 05:17:34.138 align:start position:0%
deceased persons nuclear and nuclear
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
waste and septage and all the items on
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:46.368 --> 05:17:46.378 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire there are 270 give
 
05:17:48.530 --> 05:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
or take operating facilities and we
 
05:17:50.170 --> 05:17:50.180 align:start position:0%
split those into three different
 
05:17:52.670 --> 05:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
categories we have collection storage
 
05:17:54.890 --> 05:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
and transfer facilities such as you know
 
05:17:57.050 --> 05:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
your town transfer station
 
05:17:58.250 --> 05:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
um we have processing and treatment
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
facilities composting facilities and
 
05:18:03.530 --> 05:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
incinerators would be examples of those
 
05:18:07.250 --> 05:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
and then we have landfills which Jeff
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
alluded to there are six major landfills
 
05:18:11.090 --> 05:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I'll go into a little
 
05:18:13.250 --> 05:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
bit of detail on those in an upcoming
 
05:18:13.260 --> 05:18:14.150 align:start position:0%
bit of detail on those in an upcoming
slide

05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
slide
 
05:18:16.250 --> 05:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
so in addition we have a total of about
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
600 inactive or closed facilities in New
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fairly evenly split between
 
05:18:23.208 --> 05:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
asbestos disposal sites and those are
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
sites known to have been contaminated by
 
05:18:29.090 --> 05:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
asbestos material that stemmed from the
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
Johns Manville site in Nashua so those
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
are between the cities of Nashua and
 
05:18:34.320 --> 05:18:35.448 align:start position:0%
are between the cities of Nashua and
Hudson

05:18:35.448 --> 05:18:35.458 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
Town Hudson and um 300 Town dumps we
 
05:18:44.330 --> 05:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
would call your your Old Town Town dumps
 
05:18:44.340 --> 05:18:46.850 align:start position:0%
would call your your Old Town Town dumps
um

05:18:46.850 --> 05:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:49.310 --> 05:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
so last slide some of us are kind of
 
05:18:51.230 --> 05:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
numbers junkies so I wanted to provide
 
05:18:53.690 --> 05:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
some information regarding
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
um disposal of waste in New Hampshire
 
05:18:58.090 --> 05:18:58.100 align:start position:0%
and where that goes and and to whom
 
05:19:00.530 --> 05:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
these facilities are required to submit
 
05:19:02.110 --> 05:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
reports to us on an annual basis
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
detailing the solid waste that they take
 
05:19:04.560 --> 05:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
detailing the solid waste that they take
in

05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:19:07.788 --> 05:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
and the types of solid waste that
 
05:19:09.310 --> 05:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
they're permitted to
 
05:19:12.770 --> 05:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
this data is from the 2020 reports
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
and we've split that into limited
 
05:19:17.570 --> 05:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
service area landfills and unlimited
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
service area basically all that means is
 
05:19:21.650 --> 05:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
a limited service area they are only
 
05:19:23.930 --> 05:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
permitted to take waste from a limited
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
service area on unlimited they're
 
05:19:30.050 --> 05:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
allowed to to take waste from anywhere
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh we also have one waste energy
 
05:19:33.770 --> 05:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
facility and that would be Wheelabrator
 
05:19:36.170 --> 05:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
in Concord let me back up the three
 
05:19:38.090 --> 05:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
limited service area landfills would be
 
05:19:41.090 --> 05:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
Nashua Four Hills in Nashua the Lebanon
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
landfill and the lower Mount Washington
 
05:19:45.050 --> 05:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
Valley landfill in Conway
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
and then the unlimited service area
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
landfills are Mount Carberry in success
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
nces in Bethlehem and tlr3 TurnKey
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
landfill in Rochester
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time and we look
 
05:20:00.170 --> 05:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
forward to engaging with you in the
 
05:20:04.250 --> 05:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:06.050 --> 05:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
last but not least we have Todd
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
piskovitz the administrator of the
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairperson and members
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Todd
 
05:20:23.090 --> 05:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
piskovitz I'm the administrator of the
 
05:20:25.490 --> 05:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste Management Bureau so the
 
05:20:27.288 --> 05:20:27.298 align:start position:0%
resource conservation and Recovery Act
 
05:20:29.090 --> 05:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
or request establishes Federal
 
05:20:31.550 --> 05:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
requirements for the management of
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and provides for federal
 
05:20:36.288 --> 05:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
authorization of State programs that are
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
at least as stringent as the federal
 
05:20:38.040 --> 05:20:39.590 align:start position:0%
at least as stringent as the federal
program

05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
similar to the UST program Des has been
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
authorized by EPA to implement requ in
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we currently receive
 
05:20:50.570 --> 05:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
approximately 522 thousand dollars
 
05:20:52.970 --> 05:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
annually to implement the program
 
05:20:54.890 --> 05:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
the Hazardous Waste Management Bureau is
 
05:20:57.050 --> 05:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
the arm of Des designated to assure
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
compliance with request we do that
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
through compliance and enforcement
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
training and Outreach information
 
05:21:06.170 --> 05:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
management and technical assistance
 
05:21:09.368 --> 05:21:09.378 align:start position:0%
we're a 15-person bureau
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
divided into five sections thank you
 
05:21:14.810 --> 05:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
and it starts with drafting hazardous
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
waste rules that align with the epa's
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
regulations and oftentimes is is more
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
stringent and then shepherding those
 
05:21:23.090 --> 05:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
Draft rules through the rulemaking
 
05:21:25.730 --> 05:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
process we're also responsible for
 
05:21:28.250 --> 05:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
regulate regularly updating our EPA
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
authorization and once authorized the
 
05:21:33.050 --> 05:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
program the state program is enforceable
 
05:21:36.410 --> 05:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the federal program
 
05:21:38.810 --> 05:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
there are over 2 000 generators of
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste in the state and those
 
05:21:43.490 --> 05:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
that generate more than 220 pounds of
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste per month which is about
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
300 facilities are required to attend
 
05:21:50.930 --> 05:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
annual hazardous waste training and to
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
maintain at least one stat Des certified
 
05:21:53.520 --> 05:21:54.890 align:start position:0%
maintain at least one stat Des certified
staff

05:21:54.890 --> 05:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:21:57.770 --> 05:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
those that generate less than 220 pounds
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
of hazardous waste per month are
 
05:22:01.850 --> 05:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
required to self-certify every three
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
years that they're complying with the
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
regulations our staff provides about 25
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
one to two day hazardous waste training
 
05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
we also provide engineering support and
 
05:22:17.448 --> 05:22:17.458 align:start position:0%
we review and process applications for
 
05:22:19.610 --> 05:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
all hazardous waste permits there
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
currently aren't any tsdfs in New
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is one 10-day Transfer
 
05:22:26.810 --> 05:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
Facility that's in Newington but we also
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
issue 10 to 15 limited permits annually
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
these allow for The Limited treatment of
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste by generators at their
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
facility and their function is to reduce
 
05:22:39.170 --> 05:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
the volume of hazardous waste that
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
requires off-site disposal there are
 
05:22:43.730 --> 05:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
currently 63 facilities in New Hampshire
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
with active limited permits
 
05:22:49.490 --> 05:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
to assess compliance at facilities we
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
conduct inspections of hazardous waste
 
05:22:54.530 --> 05:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
and and compare what they're doing with
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
the Hazardous Waste or used oil
 
05:22:56.280 --> 05:22:57.708 align:start position:0%
the Hazardous Waste or used oil
regulations

05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:23:00.288 --> 05:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
we strive to enforce the rules in a
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
consistent manner this year we plan to
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
complete full compliance inspections of
 
05:23:07.550 --> 05:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
16 large quantity generators and 16
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
others that's with three inspectors the
 
05:23:13.010 --> 05:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
EPA also has inspection Authority and
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
they'll do a couple of inspections a
 
05:23:16.550 --> 05:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
year as well
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
finally a reporting and information
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
section tracks activity and
 
05:23:22.368 --> 05:23:22.378 align:start position:0%
transportation of hazardous waste last
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
year more than 2 000 facilities in New
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generated more than 11 and a
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
half million pounds of hazardous waste
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
that they shipped off site for treatment
 
05:23:33.170 --> 05:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
disposal and Recycling and our program
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
is there to help ensure that those 11
 
05:23:38.448 --> 05:23:38.458 align:start position:0%
million pounds are handled properly and
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't make their way into the
 
05:23:39.600 --> 05:23:41.150 align:start position:0%
don't make their way into the
environment

05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:44.590 --> 05:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
thanks Todd
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
that concludes the information that we
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
have prepared for you and we do have
 
05:23:51.650 --> 05:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
time for questions I can call up any one
 
05:23:55.490 --> 05:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it uh
 
05:24:01.390 --> 05:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
any questions from our committee
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative datsey
 
05:24:08.030 --> 05:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes can you tell us how you dispose
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
and where you dispose of contaminated
 
05:24:09.840 --> 05:24:11.448 align:start position:0%
and where you dispose of contaminated
soil

05:24:11.448 --> 05:24:11.458 align:start position:0%
soil
 
05:24:14.208 --> 05:24:14.218 align:start position:0%
sure uh Jack or Bob would you like to
 
05:24:14.218 --> 05:24:22.910 align:start position:0%
sure uh Jack or Bob would you like to
Jeff

05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
so contaminated soil generally has to be
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
characterized for transport to off-site
 
05:24:29.810 --> 05:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
disposal facilities
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
um so in some cases it's considered
 
05:24:33.170 --> 05:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
solid waste and it might be disposed of
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
as a in a landfill in other cases it may
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
be hazardous waste there might be
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
managed at a hazardous waste facility
 
05:24:41.930 --> 05:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
but you know characterizing that soil is
 
05:24:43.550 --> 05:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
kind of the key in understanding what
 
05:24:45.530 --> 05:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
contaminants are present and how that
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be managed
 
05:24:48.240 --> 05:24:50.470 align:start position:0%
needs to be managed
foreign

05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
05:24:55.490 --> 05:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
05:24:58.080 --> 05:24:58.090 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.090 --> 05:24:59.628 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:25:02.930 --> 05:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
Anthony Drew in but maybe not um my
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
question was around delisting of
 
05:25:07.788 --> 05:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
Superfund sites how does a d-listed how
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
does a Superfund Site become delisted
 
05:25:11.930 --> 05:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
good question and that's actually Jeff
 
05:25:16.850 --> 05:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
so basically it has to go through a
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
process of being determined to
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
substantially comply with des and EPA
 
05:25:24.120 --> 05:25:25.310 align:start position:0%
substantially comply with des and EPA
rules

05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
um the one that happened for the
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Town garage happened a
 
05:25:30.050 --> 05:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
number of years ago so you know frankly
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
I think our other sites are are not in a
 
05:25:33.288 --> 05:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
position to be delisted because they all
 
05:25:34.730 --> 05:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
have you know substantial environmental
 
05:25:36.470 --> 05:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
issues that are being worked through or
 
05:25:36.480 --> 05:25:37.730 align:start position:0%
issues that are being worked through or
managed

05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
managed
 
05:25:39.288 --> 05:25:39.298 align:start position:0%
um so you know as far as the nuts and
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
bolts it basically has to you know be
 
05:25:43.250 --> 05:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
substantially clean to uh to go through
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
that process
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:47.990 --> 05:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
so this question this question is for
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
Anthony drouin uh so
 
05:25:56.810 --> 05:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
um last term we did a bill in this
 
05:25:58.730 --> 05:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
committee that uh
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with establishing uh soil pfas
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
levels and uh
 
05:26:09.770 --> 05:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
the and I was wondering uh part of that
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
was contingent on the results of the
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
USGS study of
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
um pfas and
 
05:26:16.920 --> 05:26:17.810 align:start position:0%
um pfas and
um

05:26:17.810 --> 05:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:21.890 --> 05:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering uh what Pro where is
 
05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
that in
 
05:26:24.770 --> 05:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
what progress has been made on that
 
05:26:26.570 --> 05:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
where are we look what are we looking at
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh what the background pfas
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
levels are in soils and what would then
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
count as further contaminated
 
05:26:36.490 --> 05:26:36.500 align:start position:0%
so great I know uh Anthony
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
and I are both working on that project
 
05:26:42.050 --> 05:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
and involved several components so
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
um the USGS has been working with Des to
 
05:26:48.650 --> 05:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
study pfas occurrence in Shallow soil
 
05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
around the state so as part of that work
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
they collected approximately a hundred
 
05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh or samples from 100 locations around
 
05:26:59.570 --> 05:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
the state uh somewhat randomly selected
 
05:27:01.730 --> 05:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
based on areas that had limited
 
05:27:04.368 --> 05:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
disturbance so we're targeting forested
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
areas places that hadn't been developed
 
05:27:12.170 --> 05:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
and that data has been published and
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
made available to the public through a
 
05:27:16.310 --> 05:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
USGS data release site so that was our
 
05:27:19.850 --> 05:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
task one of this USGS study task two was
 
05:27:22.850 --> 05:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
a series of bench experiments to
 
05:27:26.208 --> 05:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
evaluate how pfas Leech from New
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific soil so we different
 
05:27:30.530 --> 05:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
we identified approximately five
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
different soil types that are
 
05:27:34.250 --> 05:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
characteristic of soils found around the
 
05:27:36.890 --> 05:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
State and we collected soil samples
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
they've been uh
 
05:27:41.448 --> 05:27:41.458 align:start position:0%
had various amounts of pfas added to
 
05:27:43.610 --> 05:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
them and a series of experiments have
 
05:27:46.490 --> 05:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
been done to evaluate what parameters
 
05:27:47.690 --> 05:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
affect leaching because there's
 
05:27:50.448 --> 05:27:50.458 align:start position:0%
different factors that can influence
 
05:27:53.330 --> 05:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
that leech ability such as pH we even
 
05:27:55.850 --> 05:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
looked at protein and essentially the
 
05:27:58.550 --> 05:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
results of that study are anticipated to
 
05:28:01.610 --> 05:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
be released about the end of January but
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just copy out that's dependent upon
 
05:28:04.850 --> 05:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
the last few samples getting through
 
05:28:07.250 --> 05:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
laboratory analysis our labs are very
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
backed up right now with the number of
 
05:28:10.730 --> 05:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
pfas samples so it it might be a little
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
bit later than the end of January but
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating that very soon and
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
then the third component was a field
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
study looking at two specific sites one
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
was an a triple F site where we have
 
05:28:23.090 --> 05:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
contamination and the USGS did some
 
05:28:25.550 --> 05:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
detailed soil evaluations groundwater
 
05:28:28.128 --> 05:28:28.138 align:start position:0%
evaluations and what we call poor water
 
05:28:30.170 --> 05:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
sampling using lysimeters so that's
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
measuring water as it percolates through
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
the soil column but hasn't quite reached
 
05:28:36.770 --> 05:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
the water table and that that data
 
05:28:38.690 --> 05:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
really should be happening about the end
 
05:28:40.970 --> 05:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
of January so sort of circling back to
 
05:28:42.770 --> 05:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
where we are on uh direct contact
 
05:28:45.410 --> 05:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
screening values we've assembled a
 
05:28:47.930 --> 05:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
committee in uh the Hazardous Waste
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau that has hired a
 
05:28:53.230 --> 05:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
outside contractor for technical support
 
05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
on uh modeling uh pfas leachability and
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
soil so we're going to be using that
 
05:29:00.890 --> 05:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
contractor to take the data that's going
 
05:29:03.288 --> 05:29:03.298 align:start position:0%
to be forthcoming from the USGS and
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the most appropriate models
 
05:29:07.970 --> 05:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
that are available this is an area of
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
again rapidly evolving science which is
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
why we've reached out to uh you know
 
05:29:14.090 --> 05:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
experts in in the field and we've
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
assembled our internal team of experts
 
05:29:19.310 --> 05:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
to evaluate that data and our our goal
 
05:29:21.288 --> 05:29:21.298 align:start position:0%
is to comply with the RSA that was
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
passed that requires initiation of rule
 
05:29:27.650 --> 05:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
making by November of this year
 
05:29:27.660 --> 05:29:29.810 align:start position:0%
making by November of this year
okay

05:29:29.810 --> 05:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:29:31.550 --> 05:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
um first I have a question too and I'll
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
get to you I
 
05:29:37.368 --> 05:29:37.378 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead I'm sorry yeah so
 
05:29:40.070 --> 05:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
um did it uh what in the those
 
05:29:42.410 --> 05:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
undisturbed sites what sort of presence
 
05:29:44.330 --> 05:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
of pfas were you finding in in those
 
05:29:44.340 --> 05:29:46.430 align:start position:0%
of pfas were you finding in in those
sites

05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
sites
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
so pfas was detected in every single one
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
of those sites there was some level of
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
pfas found
 
05:29:53.520 --> 05:29:54.470 align:start position:0%
pfas found
um

05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:56.390 --> 05:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know that there was generally less
 
05:29:58.850 --> 05:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
than about a part per billion and if
 
05:30:01.090 --> 05:30:01.100 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with pfas and analytical
 
05:30:03.708 --> 05:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
capabilities most Laboratories most
 
05:30:06.770 --> 05:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
commercial Laboratories can't detect
 
05:30:10.010 --> 05:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
below a part per billion so we worked
 
05:30:12.410 --> 05:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
with a laboratory to really sort of push
 
05:30:15.050 --> 05:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
the limits of analytical capabilities to
 
05:30:16.730 --> 05:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
get down below a part per building
 
05:30:18.410 --> 05:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
because there were studies uh from
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
across the country that that suggests
 
05:30:21.770 --> 05:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
there may be lower lower concentrations
 
05:30:23.690 --> 05:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
and indeed once we sent these samples
 
05:30:25.730 --> 05:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
off to Laboratories we were finding you
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
know generally less than a part per
 
05:30:30.110 --> 05:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
billion for individual pfas uh chemicals
 
05:30:32.690 --> 05:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
so so generally every single sample had
 
05:30:36.170 --> 05:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
at least one pfas detected and um
 
05:30:37.610 --> 05:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
another part of the story is we've gone
 
05:30:40.490 --> 05:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
back to to resample some of the ones uh
 
05:30:42.288 --> 05:30:42.298 align:start position:0%
some of the sites that had slightly
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
elevated uh pfas and I think by elevated
 
05:30:48.288 --> 05:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about maybe as high as six
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
parts per billion in contrast at some
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
waste sites we are seeing hundreds of
 
05:30:56.208 --> 05:30:56.218 align:start position:0%
parts per billion uh so just to put in
 
05:30:56.218 --> 05:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
parts per billion uh so just to put in
perspective

05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so the results of that resampling
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
should also be coming out uh end of
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
January time frame
 
05:31:06.410 --> 05:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay um I my question is do we ever have
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
any instances of contamination happening
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
from a bordering state or even Canada
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
well you know I think as we you know
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're starting to evaluate
 
05:31:17.760 --> 05:31:18.470 align:start position:0%
we're starting to evaluate
um

05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
these data in the context of Regional
 
05:31:23.208 --> 05:31:23.218 align:start position:0%
Air patterns uh because you know there
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
have been studies that that found pfas
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
in in polar bear blood so you know I
 
05:31:29.890 --> 05:31:29.900 align:start position:0%
think there is a component to
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
large-scale transport you know I've
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
talked to uh the folks in our air
 
05:31:37.070 --> 05:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
division who have looked at acid rain
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and sort of the Regional Air pattern
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
so you know that that's something I
 
05:31:43.368 --> 05:31:43.378 align:start position:0%
think we're going to consider but you
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
know I think there is a component of
 
05:31:46.788 --> 05:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
long-range transport exactly what that
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
is you know we're still in the very
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
early stages of you know considering I
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot to look at uh with
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
with these data thank you you have a
 
05:31:57.650 --> 05:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
question over here representative Howard
 
05:31:59.690 --> 05:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
05:32:01.610 --> 05:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
um I I noticed on I think this question
 
05:32:03.530 --> 05:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
is for Ms McKenna
 
05:32:05.930 --> 05:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that where it said what is
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste and solid waste equals
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and then in the next paragraph
 
05:32:13.190 --> 05:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
sideways does not equal
 
05:32:15.170 --> 05:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
um hazardous waste and yet in the
 
05:32:17.230 --> 05:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph above it lists asbestos
 
05:32:21.170 --> 05:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
infectious waste and bulky waste so how
 
05:32:22.850 --> 05:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
is it that those are broken out to be
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
not not um hazardous waste
 
05:32:29.270 --> 05:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
so by by definition those items so bulky
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
waste examples
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
um like appliances appliances well
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's white goods but potentially
 
05:32:38.208 --> 05:32:38.218 align:start position:0%
um and those would be free of of any
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
sort of refrigerants so so we aren't
 
05:32:41.570 --> 05:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
talking about white goods that would
 
05:32:43.730 --> 05:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
have a hazardous waste component to them
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
and how about Asbestos and infectious
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
waste is there is that broken out into a
 
05:32:48.480 --> 05:32:49.368 align:start position:0%
waste is there is that broken out into a
separate

05:32:49.368 --> 05:32:49.378 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:32:52.250 --> 05:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
place or they are solid waste there's
 
05:32:53.930 --> 05:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste without being hazardous
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
waste they are solid waste without being
 
05:32:58.368 --> 05:32:58.378 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste that's interesting yeah
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's yeah it's statutory definition of
 
05:33:02.930 --> 05:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
I see yeah I see okay thank you yeah
 
05:33:02.940 --> 05:33:05.390 align:start position:0%
I see yeah I see okay thank you yeah
sure

05:33:05.390 --> 05:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
Todd has a follow-up representative oh
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me so by statutory definition in
 
05:33:15.170 --> 05:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
order to be a hazardous waste it either
 
05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
has to have one of four category uh
 
05:33:20.890 --> 05:33:20.900 align:start position:0%
characteristics either ignitable toxic
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
and by toxic it has to fail a certain
 
05:33:24.840 --> 05:33:26.690 align:start position:0%
and by toxic it has to fail a certain
test

05:33:26.690 --> 05:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:33:26.700 --> 05:33:29.090 align:start position:0%
test
um

05:33:29.090 --> 05:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
corrosive it has to be corrosive
 
05:33:35.810 --> 05:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
why am I not
 
05:33:41.448 --> 05:33:41.458 align:start position:0%
and reactive so thank you thank you from
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
the audience
 
05:33:42.840 --> 05:33:43.850 align:start position:0%
the audience
um

05:33:43.850 --> 05:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:46.550 --> 05:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
or it has to be listed and there's a
 
05:33:48.890 --> 05:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
list of several hundred chemicals and
 
05:33:51.288 --> 05:33:51.298 align:start position:0%
asbestos is a separate category and
 
05:33:52.610 --> 05:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
those other things are separate
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
categories so there is a statutory
 
05:33:56.690 --> 05:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
definition of what has situation so are
 
05:33:58.970 --> 05:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
these things static in a way that those
 
05:34:00.128 --> 05:34:00.138 align:start position:0%
other it sounds like those other
 
05:34:02.750 --> 05:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
characters that are Dynamic and and
 
05:34:05.330 --> 05:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
interactive with things and and things
 
05:34:07.850 --> 05:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
like infectious waste and asbestos are
 
05:34:10.930 --> 05:34:10.940 align:start position:0%
static in the in the waste stream well
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's stat it's it's that
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
they don't they just don't meet the
 
05:34:17.208 --> 05:34:17.218 align:start position:0%
definition like for instance you you'd
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
probably think
 
05:34:21.288 --> 05:34:21.298 align:start position:0%
asbestos would be toxic but there isn't
 
05:34:24.410 --> 05:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of the toxicity definition but
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
there is not a a toxicity test for that
 
05:34:31.730 --> 05:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a separate category so in
 
05:34:33.650 --> 05:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
order to be considered toxic it has to
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
fail what's called a toxicity
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
characteristic leaching procedure test
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a a list of tests that EPA
 
05:34:44.030 --> 05:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
has developed that
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
that a chemical or a constituent has to
 
05:34:51.288 --> 05:34:51.298 align:start position:0%
fail in order to be considered toxic
 
05:34:53.868 --> 05:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
okay one more quick question from
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:10.610 --> 05:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Denzel you had a question
 
05:35:13.850 --> 05:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
so I think this is for
 
05:35:17.810 --> 05:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
um Cheryl Bondi it it's concerning MTB
 
05:35:21.410 --> 05:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
as well as pfas questions so
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
for several years I worked for a water
 
05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
water purification company as well as a
 
05:35:30.310 --> 05:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
well driller and then had my own
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
huge system at our home and so I I
 
05:35:34.910 --> 05:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
followed everything for a while from the
 
05:35:37.550 --> 05:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
time that Hassan was leaving office with
 
05:35:40.850 --> 05:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
that big huge settlement with Exxon and
 
05:35:42.650 --> 05:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
the state you know put together a
 
05:35:45.470 --> 05:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
website and and was um trying to be
 
05:35:47.930 --> 05:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
transparent as well as every I followed
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
everything that had to do with Saint
 
05:35:52.368 --> 05:35:52.378 align:start position:0%
Cobain many people were were literally
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
drinking poisoned water for a year and a
 
05:35:56.208 --> 05:35:56.218 align:start position:0%
half and still had nothing
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um done so where is all that and where's
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
all that money are there still those
 
05:36:04.368 --> 05:36:04.378 align:start position:0%
transparency websites and are we because
 
05:36:06.410 --> 05:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
last I knew there was still problems
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
going on at Saint gobane and they're
 
05:36:10.368 --> 05:36:10.378 align:start position:0%
still running operations as normal so
 
05:36:13.128 --> 05:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
this is a very big question but as much
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
as you could give me I'd really like to
 
05:36:14.638 --> 05:36:16.670 align:start position:0%
as you could give me I'd really like to
know

05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah so when we're talking about
 
05:36:19.490 --> 05:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
seeing go bam we have a responsible
 
05:36:21.410 --> 05:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
party so I'm actually going to let Jeff
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
take your question but to just back up
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
for a moment so people know so the MTV
 
05:36:27.410 --> 05:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
settlement we uh the state went in a
 
05:36:29.690 --> 05:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against 16 Distributors of fuel
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh 15 of them settled that was the 82
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
million that we have been spending that
 
05:36:37.128 --> 05:36:37.138 align:start position:0%
has to be only spent on MTB remedia sure
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
the one that didn't set up we went to
 
05:36:40.850 --> 05:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
court that was where we got the 276
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
million and that's the groundwater trust
 
05:36:42.360 --> 05:36:43.250 align:start position:0%
million and that's the groundwater trust
fund

05:36:43.250 --> 05:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:36:43.260 --> 05:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
fund
it's

05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so to give you a little bit of an
 
05:36:57.050 --> 05:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
update on on cincobain so uh cincobain
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
was and for those of you who might not
 
05:37:00.650 --> 05:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
be familiar was an air emissions
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
facility so they coded textiles with uh
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
pfas containing chemicals and those
 
05:37:08.030 --> 05:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
textiles as part of the process went
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
through a series of vertical dryers and
 
05:37:13.010 --> 05:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
the the pfas containing dispersion was
 
05:37:15.530 --> 05:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
essentially evaporated off dried off and
 
05:37:18.010 --> 05:37:18.020 align:start position:0%
pfas was emitted from the facilities
 
05:37:20.770 --> 05:37:20.780 align:start position:0%
stacks and transported through the air
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
deposited on the ground in several
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities where
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination ensued so this
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
was first discovered in 2016 when the
 
05:37:33.288 --> 05:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
facility sampled tap water that was
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
provided by the Merrimack Village
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
district and it was recognized that the
 
05:37:37.550 --> 05:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
tap water was contaminated and it
 
05:37:39.410 --> 05:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
started a huge investigation
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
so where we are today is that
 
05:37:45.530 --> 05:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
um cincobain has installed air emission
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
controls it was required by a change of
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
law in our air Resources Division
 
05:37:52.250 --> 05:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
oversaw the permitting of that uh
 
05:37:54.770 --> 05:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
emission control which essentially
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
um is a what is called a regenerative
 
05:37:59.330 --> 05:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
thermal oxidizer so they take natural
 
05:38:02.448 --> 05:38:02.458 align:start position:0%
gas heat up a chamber put the pfas air
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
emissions through this chamber and
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
effectively break the carbon fluorine
 
05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
bonds so that the emissions comply with
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
the permit
 
05:38:13.310 --> 05:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the groundwater
 
05:38:16.250 --> 05:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
investigation cincobain was required to
 
05:38:19.730 --> 05:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
investigate the area within what we call
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
the consent decree there was a 2018
 
05:38:23.448 --> 05:38:23.458 align:start position:0%
consent decree between the state of New
 
05:38:25.788 --> 05:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and cincobain and this area
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
was was part of that definition it's
 
05:38:30.770 --> 05:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
approximately 64 square miles involving
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
five or six towns and uh
 
05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
syncopene has been investigating a des
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
request groundwater quality within this
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
area and in 2019 the standard for pfoa
 
05:38:45.410 --> 05:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
which is the primary contaminant from
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
Saint Cobain that we're finding in
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
groundwater that standard was lowered
 
05:38:52.490 --> 05:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
from 70 parts per trillion to 19 to 12
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion which greatly
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
expanded the area under investigation
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
because the 70 part petroleum area had
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
frankly been pretty well characterized
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
prior to 2019 but with that lowering the
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
standard that an investigation expanded
 
05:39:07.200 --> 05:39:08.330 align:start position:0%
standard that an investigation expanded
outward

05:39:08.330 --> 05:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
outward
 
05:39:10.610 --> 05:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
and currently cincobain is now in the
 
05:39:13.250 --> 05:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
phase of um beginning to implement
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
permanent remedies so when they would
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
identify a property over standard they
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
would provide bottled water and
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately people have been on
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
bottled water for um in some cases since
 
05:39:24.410 --> 05:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
2019 so some residents been on for
 
05:39:27.050 --> 05:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
several years and uh
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
we're now at the point where they're
 
05:39:30.410 --> 05:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
beginning to install point of entry
 
05:39:32.810 --> 05:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
treatment systems for some residents and
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're evaluating water lines and
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
designing water lines for certain areas
 
05:39:40.550 --> 05:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
where water line feasibility is uh is an
 
05:39:40.560 --> 05:39:42.350 align:start position:0%
where water line feasibility is uh is an
option

05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
is there a component of your question
 
05:39:46.430 --> 05:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that just that just makes me angry
 
05:39:48.590 --> 05:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's just all I mean literally those
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
people three years I mean and we're just
 
05:39:52.610 --> 05:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
going to let them continue to operate
 
05:39:54.470 --> 05:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
bottled water I mean it's not just
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
bottled water it's it's exactly what
 
05:39:58.730 --> 05:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
you're in the shower and all of that
 
05:40:00.530 --> 05:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
you're I mean you're contaminated from
 
05:40:02.930 --> 05:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
all of those things and I just I can't I
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
just know from my friend that lives in
 
05:40:05.448 --> 05:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
Litchfield because this is Litchfield
 
05:40:07.850 --> 05:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
this is Bedford this is Merrimack this
 
05:40:10.850 --> 05:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
is Hudson I mean all of these towns
 
05:40:13.970 --> 05:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand a multi-billion
 
05:40:16.128 --> 05:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
dollar million dollar company that's
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
continuing to be a polluter and we've on
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
our watch have just let that happen
 
05:40:23.448 --> 05:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunately this has turned
 
05:40:26.090 --> 05:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
into a bit of a legal uh issue so Des
 
05:40:29.150 --> 05:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
has had to work with uh doj uh to enter
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
into legal negotiations on many aspects
 
05:40:32.868 --> 05:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:40:35.448 --> 05:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's taken taken longer

with our department for 35 years so has
 
05:42:55.250 --> 05:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
not only current knowledge about the
 
05:42:57.708 --> 05:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
dairy program but a lot of historical
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:03.650 --> 05:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
so thank you for allowing me the
 
05:43:04.850 --> 05:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about the food
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
protection section within the Department
 
05:43:08.930 --> 05:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services our mission
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
is to protect the Safety and Security of
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
the food supply in New Hampshire and we
 
05:43:15.410 --> 05:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
take this role very very seriously we
 
05:43:16.970 --> 05:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
know not only are we protecting the food
 
05:43:19.250 --> 05:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
supply of New Hampshire residents but we
 
05:43:20.448 --> 05:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
also know how important the food
 
05:43:22.490 --> 05:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
industry is to our tourists that visit
 
05:43:25.250 --> 05:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
the state so we are are inspecting not
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
only restaurants but also food that
 
05:43:30.770 --> 05:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
you'll find in grocery stores are dairy
 
05:43:34.250 --> 05:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
plants and we also have a shellfish
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
program which I'll talk more in detail
 
05:43:36.240 --> 05:43:38.448 align:start position:0%
program which I'll talk more in detail
about

05:43:38.448 --> 05:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:40.250 --> 05:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned we have four sub
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
programs within the food Protection
 
05:43:44.330 --> 05:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
Program we have 20 employees total and
 
05:43:46.970 --> 05:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
this is a photo of our of our group they
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of responsibility we have as
 
05:43:51.530 --> 05:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
I mentioned before our Dairy program a
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
beverage and bottled water program in
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
our food sanitation program which you'll
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
know as probably the any food that's
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
served immediately to Consumer at either
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
at a grocery store a deli a restaurant
 
05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
or also food that's manufactured food
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
and then finally our molluscan shellfish
 
05:44:09.420 --> 05:44:11.208 align:start position:0%
and then finally our molluscan shellfish
program

05:44:11.208 --> 05:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'll first talk about our food
 
05:44:14.690 --> 05:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
sanitation program that's our largest
 
05:44:17.628 --> 05:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
program we have nine and a half
 
05:44:20.930 --> 05:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
employees and when I say a half a time
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
employee we have a we have two part-time
 
05:44:25.850 --> 05:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
employees and we also have staff that
 
05:44:28.570 --> 05:44:28.580 align:start position:0%
are split between multiple programs
 
05:44:31.850 --> 05:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
they inspect grocery stores schools
 
05:44:34.730 --> 05:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
restaurants Mobile Food units or food
 
05:44:36.530 --> 05:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
trucks which have been growing in
 
05:44:39.170 --> 05:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
popularity over the last 10 years
 
05:44:42.410 --> 05:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
definitely we inspect food manufacturers
 
05:44:44.930 --> 05:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
and that could be anything from a large
 
05:44:47.810 --> 05:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
company producing food we have several
 
05:44:49.850 --> 05:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
of those in the state but it also could
 
05:44:52.910 --> 05:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
be very home could be home-based food
 
05:44:56.570 --> 05:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
producers or those making Jam jams or
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
jellies or pickles or relishes in a
 
05:45:00.470 --> 05:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen so really runs the
 
05:45:03.288 --> 05:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
gamut between a million dollar companies
 
05:45:06.470 --> 05:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
to to very small producers
 
05:45:08.570 --> 05:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
um bed and breakfast facilities bakeries
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
and bars and lounges all fall within
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:16.490 --> 05:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
our food inspectors they may have as
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
many as 600 to 700 establishments under
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
their purview we split the state
 
05:45:24.110 --> 05:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
regionally they're inspected every 12
 
05:45:27.048 --> 05:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
months or three years based on risk and
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
when we look at doing risk-based
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
inspections that means those that have
 
05:45:33.470 --> 05:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
more of a complex menu are inspected
 
05:45:36.288 --> 05:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
more frequently than maybe a store that
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
only is selling milk and eggs so that
 
05:45:40.970 --> 05:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
that would be a type of establishment
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would get inspected every three
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
years but your full service restaurants
 
05:45:46.490 --> 05:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
those have a higher frequency of
 
05:45:46.500 --> 05:45:48.890 align:start position:0%
those have a higher frequency of
inspection

05:45:48.890 --> 05:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:51.410 --> 05:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
and this is a map to show how our food
 
05:45:53.208 --> 05:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
inspectors are dispersed they they're
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
based out of their homes so they they
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
travel to their inspection District
 
05:45:59.570 --> 05:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
based on where they live it's a little
 
05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
bit hard to read on this map but those
 
05:46:03.048 --> 05:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that are identified in
 
05:46:05.570 --> 05:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
white we have 15 of them they're what
 
05:46:07.730 --> 05:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
are called self-inspecting cities and
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
towns and that means the local Health
 
05:46:12.650 --> 05:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
officer has responsibility for doing the
 
05:46:19.070 --> 05:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.368 --> 05:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
so that's an example of what's not under
 
05:46:26.090 --> 05:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of our section and I'll
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
be honest with you the the food the food
 
05:46:30.288 --> 05:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are very complex in the
 
05:46:31.368 --> 05:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
state as I mentioned we have
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting cities and towns some we
 
05:46:37.490 --> 05:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
do not at the state level uh inspect
 
05:46:39.410 --> 05:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
temporary food establishments so these
 
05:46:41.570 --> 05:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
would be food establishments that would
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
be serving food at for instance the New
 
05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Motor Speedway as a part of
 
05:46:48.250 --> 05:46:48.260 align:start position:0%
the the race there
 
05:46:51.170 --> 05:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
with one caveat we do do voluntary
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
inspections of those those pictures
 
05:46:54.650 --> 05:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
actually the picture on this slide is
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually one of our inspectors doing
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
those Inspections just to make sure
 
05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
everything is in order but we don't
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
license those types of facilities that
 
05:47:05.090 --> 05:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
are exempt from our license but there
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
are some high profile events such as New
 
05:47:08.570 --> 05:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Motor Speedway that we do do
 
05:47:10.490 --> 05:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
inspections of just because of the sheer
 
05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
volume of folks that they they serve in
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
those events but they don't they're not
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed that would also
 
05:47:20.448 --> 05:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
mean um like your Deerfield Fair those
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
the event the food trucks or food
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
establishments at that those venues
 
05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from our licensing and
 
05:47:26.760 --> 05:47:28.690 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from our licensing and
inspection

05:47:28.690 --> 05:47:28.700 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service establishments
 
05:47:33.288 --> 05:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
and what that is is any establishment
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's operating four days or less in a
 
05:47:37.970 --> 05:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
30-day period so that would be things
 
05:47:40.610 --> 05:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
like a church breakfast those because
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're only operating once a week
 
05:47:44.270 --> 05:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from our licensing and
 
05:47:44.280 --> 05:47:45.530 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from our licensing and
inspection

05:47:45.530 --> 05:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
our food pantries and soup kitchens are
 
05:47:50.810 --> 05:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
also exempt by Statute from from our
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
license and inspection and then Child
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
Care Centers use camps and nursing homes
 
05:47:57.948 --> 05:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
they're inspected by other agencies so
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're not inspected by by food
 
05:48:00.000 --> 05:48:03.110 align:start position:0%
they're not inspected by by food
protection

05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
and then to make things even more
 
05:48:07.250 --> 05:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
complicated we have certain Commodities
 
05:48:09.410 --> 05:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
which are regulated by the Department of
 
05:48:12.170 --> 05:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and that would be eggs maple
 
05:48:15.770 --> 05:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
syrup honey pet food and produce a
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
product that might have have maple syrup
 
05:48:19.610 --> 05:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
as an ingredient that would fall to us
 
05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
but just pure maple syrup that falls to
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.390 --> 05:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
our one of our other programs is our
 
05:48:31.490 --> 05:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
beverage and bottled water program so
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
any in-state manufacturers of bottled
 
05:48:37.610 --> 05:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
water or or soda or other other
 
05:48:39.530 --> 05:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
beverages they're part of this program
 
05:48:42.350 --> 05:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
we also register any out-of-state
 
05:48:44.570 --> 05:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of beverages in bottled
 
05:48:47.930 --> 05:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
water and one recent change in our
 
05:48:49.690 --> 05:48:49.700 align:start position:0%
regulation was
 
05:48:53.208 --> 05:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
requiring bottled water manufacturers to
 
05:48:55.730 --> 05:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
adhere to the same drinking water
 
05:48:57.970 --> 05:48:57.980 align:start position:0%
standards in our state so the pfas
 
05:49:00.048 --> 05:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
requirements that are for New Hampshire
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
drinking water they also now apply to
 
05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
any bottled water shipping to our state
 
05:49:06.350 --> 05:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
so we as part of their annual
 
05:49:08.208 --> 05:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
registration were asking for testing
 
05:49:10.730 --> 05:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
documentation to be sent to us so that's
 
05:49:12.730 --> 05:49:12.740 align:start position:0%
a an above and beyond the federal
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
regular regulations of bottled water
 
05:49:15.600 --> 05:49:19.548 align:start position:0%
regular regulations of bottled water
standards

05:49:19.548 --> 05:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:22.670 --> 05:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
our Dairy sanitation program so this is
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
a FDA Cooperative program
 
05:49:28.010 --> 05:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that any plants
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
are farms that are shipping milk
 
05:49:32.690 --> 05:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
products a grade A milk products or milk
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
across state lines they're required to
 
05:49:38.570 --> 05:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
be a part of this program and FDA gives
 
05:49:40.190 --> 05:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
the state no money but they have
 
05:49:42.288 --> 05:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
oversight over this program and that
 
05:49:44.690 --> 05:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's basically to ensure that all states
 
05:49:48.170 --> 05:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
are regulating milk and milk products to
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
the same level our inspectors have to be
 
05:49:53.530 --> 05:49:53.540 align:start position:0%
certified by FDA to do these inspections
 
05:49:55.910 --> 05:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
FDA requires us to inspect the
 
05:49:58.510 --> 05:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
facilities at certain frequencies
 
05:50:01.310 --> 05:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
which when they audit us to make sure
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we are compliant any if and it's
 
05:50:05.868 --> 05:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
something that we have very very have to
 
05:50:07.850 --> 05:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
take Monitor and keep very close
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
compliance because any violations of our
 
05:50:12.770 --> 05:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
program could be detrimental to
 
05:50:14.810 --> 05:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
um to our licensees who want to ship
 
05:50:17.390 --> 05:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
product across the state we have 90
 
05:50:21.230 --> 05:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
farms and it's Chuck Metcalf who I
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
introduced earlier he was showing me
 
05:50:24.770 --> 05:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
data about the number of farms that have
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
changed are our profile and dairy farms
 
05:50:30.350 --> 05:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
how that has changed over the last 50
 
05:50:33.230 --> 05:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
years we have actually this number just
 
05:50:35.570 --> 05:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
dropped from the time I made this slide
 
05:50:39.410 --> 05:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's now 89 we have 89 goat cow or sheep
 
05:50:42.170 --> 05:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
milk producing farms and 64 processing
 
05:50:42.180 --> 05:50:43.190 align:start position:0%
milk producing farms and 64 processing
plants

05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
plants
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
Although our processing plant numbers
 
05:50:47.330 --> 05:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
have have shifted to the upward our
 
05:50:50.208 --> 05:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
Farms have decreased over the last
 
05:50:52.430 --> 05:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
several years
 
05:50:55.368 --> 05:50:55.378 align:start position:0%
so we inspect Dairy Farms Dairy plants
 
05:50:57.770 --> 05:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
the milk collars those that are driving
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
the milk trucks milk plants those that
 
05:51:03.590 --> 05:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
are sampling milk at the plant level and
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
the dairy pasteurizers and they also our
 
05:51:07.850 --> 05:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
Dairy inspectors are also required to
 
05:51:10.250 --> 05:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
take water and milk products milk
 
05:51:12.890 --> 05:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
samples at the farm in our lab Public
 
05:51:14.570 --> 05:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
Health lab does that testing over a
 
05:51:19.368 --> 05:51:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:21.770 --> 05:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
our shellfish program so this is another
 
05:51:24.288 --> 05:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
one of those FDA Cooperative programs
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
where any of our molluscan shellfish
 
05:51:29.690 --> 05:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
dealers or Harvesters that want to
 
05:51:32.390 --> 05:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
engage in interstate commerce they um
 
05:51:35.330 --> 05:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
they have to be listed with the FDA and
 
05:51:37.128 --> 05:51:37.138 align:start position:0%
it's another one FDA provides us no
 
05:51:38.930 --> 05:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
resources but we're required to
 
05:51:40.910 --> 05:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
administer the program to their
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
standards to allow our industry to be
 
05:51:45.890 --> 05:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
able to ship across state lines this the
 
05:51:48.530 --> 05:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry has experienced a
 
05:51:50.090 --> 05:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of growth in the last
 
05:51:53.448 --> 05:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
10 years we had one Harvester licensed
 
05:51:57.650 --> 05:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and now we have 16. so that um
 
05:51:59.810 --> 05:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
that it's it's definitely an industry
 
05:52:02.330 --> 05:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
which has seen a lot of positive growth
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
and it's caught we basically have had to
 
05:52:07.730 --> 05:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
shift some resp of our staff resources
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
again because we there there has a
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of inspection frequency
 
05:52:14.868 --> 05:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
monitoring that FDA has over this
 
05:52:14.878 --> 05:52:18.948 align:start position:0%
monitoring that FDA has over this
program

05:52:18.948 --> 05:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:21.890 --> 05:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh we also respond to food emergencies
 
05:52:24.048 --> 05:52:24.058 align:start position:0%
that impact food establishment so this
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
could be power power outages fires
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
floods accidental or deliberate
 
05:52:32.990 --> 05:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
contamination of food outbreaks or we
 
05:52:35.150 --> 05:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
are we have a relationship that you know
 
05:52:37.490 --> 05:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
should there we are we do exercises in
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
case there was a an event associated
 
05:52:41.750 --> 05:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the Seabrook power plant to what
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
would happen to our food supply so those
 
05:52:49.190 --> 05:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
um certainly we don't we we work hard at
 
05:52:53.570 --> 05:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
preventing this through our licensing
 
05:52:56.628 --> 05:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
inspection process but in the event of a
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
foodborne outbreak associated with a
 
05:53:01.390 --> 05:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
food establishment we have the the
 
05:53:04.368 --> 05:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
environmental health assessment role to
 
05:53:06.350 --> 05:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
try to figure out the root cause of that
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
any foodborne outbreaks associated with
 
05:53:10.850 --> 05:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
our food establishments
 
05:53:12.590 --> 05:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
and then sure certainly if there's
 
05:53:14.930 --> 05:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
something that's in Commerce to make
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
sure that product is effectively removed
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
along those lines if there are we
 
05:53:24.530 --> 05:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
monitor FDA and USDA recalls and if we
 
05:53:25.970 --> 05:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
find that there's any products shipped
 
05:53:27.708 --> 05:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire we are trying to get
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
those distrib distribution lists and
 
05:53:31.730 --> 05:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
making sure that the stores have removed
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
those products from the shelves
 
05:53:37.070 --> 05:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
and we also um we also accept consumer
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
complaints we handle probably on average
 
05:53:41.390 --> 05:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
about a 300 consumer complaints a year
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
people either thinking that they became
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
ill from what they ate or we take many
 
05:53:48.470 --> 05:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
sanitation complaints they you know
 
05:53:48.480 --> 05:53:49.750 align:start position:0%
sanitation complaints they you know
observed

05:53:49.750 --> 05:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
observed
 
05:53:52.310 --> 05:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
poor Behavior poor sanitation behaviors
 
05:53:57.128 --> 05:53:57.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:59.208 --> 05:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
and then finally I just want to
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
highlight our our new redesigned website
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
we have tried to make it more
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
user-friendly knowing that our food
 
05:54:08.090 --> 05:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
regulations are very complex we've spent
 
05:54:10.010 --> 05:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of time trying to make things
 
05:54:12.048 --> 05:54:12.058 align:start position:0%
easier for folks to follow and get the
 
05:54:14.690 --> 05:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
answers to their questions and so I just
 
05:54:16.310 --> 05:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight that that there's
 
05:54:18.530 --> 05:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
that information and we've also worked
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
on some food safety training videos in
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
the the last year or two hopefully make
 
05:54:25.128 --> 05:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
things easier and help folks navigate
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
the not only the licensing process but
 
05:54:31.128 --> 05:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
also giving some coaching on food safety
 
05:54:31.138 --> 05:54:33.288 align:start position:0%
also giving some coaching on food safety
behaviors

05:54:33.288 --> 05:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
05:54:36.350 --> 05:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
and that um that this is this is my
 
05:54:38.990 --> 05:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
contact information I'm happy to answer
 
05:54:42.770 --> 05:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have
 
05:54:45.288 --> 05:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
no flurry of hands okay uh
 
05:54:47.570 --> 05:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby please
 
05:54:50.810 --> 05:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
yes so a couple a couple terms ago I
 
05:54:53.690 --> 05:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
think it started uh we uh had a mushroom
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
harvesting Bill come through this
 
05:54:57.770 --> 05:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
committee and uh I believe it actually
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
went finally made it through gel car in
 
05:55:02.930 --> 05:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
July and I was wondering if the classes
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
are now available for mushroom
 
05:55:08.208 --> 05:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
Harvesters great great question so we
 
05:55:10.368 --> 05:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
have we have done
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the the answer your question is no
 
05:55:15.890 --> 05:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
the class is not available I have been
 
05:55:19.128 --> 05:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
trying very very very working very very
 
05:55:21.170 --> 05:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
hard to try to get that up up and
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
running that wasn't our responsibility
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
to get the class up and running but we
 
05:55:27.410 --> 05:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
had some key stakeholders that were a
 
05:55:29.570 --> 05:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation process that had
 
05:55:31.788 --> 05:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
offered to work on putting that class
 
05:55:31.798 --> 05:55:33.110 align:start position:0%
offered to work on putting that class
together

05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
um we I'm it's one of my uh to do class
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
things in the next few months especially
 
05:55:40.750 --> 05:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
the the time for harvesting mushrooms
 
05:55:43.490 --> 05:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
right now is not so great so we're
 
05:55:45.170 --> 05:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
trying to get that stood up before the
 
05:55:48.288 --> 05:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
for the springtime so that those that
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
are looking to harvest mushrooms we do
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
have the the rural infrastructure all
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
set we have the application ready to go
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's just we need that course and if I
 
05:55:59.628 --> 05:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
can't get that our resources in state to
 
05:56:01.970 --> 05:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
um get help us get this up and running
 
05:56:04.670 --> 05:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
there are possibilities from either New
 
05:56:06.350 --> 05:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
York or Rhode Island that we can tap
 
05:56:09.048 --> 05:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
into to help hopefully get this stood up
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:13.670 --> 05:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the questions of Representative
 
05:56:13.680 --> 05:56:16.490 align:start position:0%
for the questions of Representative
Murray

05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
05:56:17.930 --> 05:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
hi it's nice to
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
nice um thanks for taking my question so
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
one question I did have was around
 
05:56:24.288 --> 05:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
aquaculture and your oversight over it
 
05:56:27.350 --> 05:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's just regarding molluscum or
 
05:56:28.850 --> 05:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
if it's an integrated aquaculture and
 
05:56:31.128 --> 05:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with things like seaweeds
 
05:56:33.410 --> 05:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
and Kelps is that also something your
 
05:56:35.330 --> 05:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
heart harvesting of those types of
 
05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
things where does that fall
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't have anyone
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
currently we've had we don't have any
 
05:56:44.030 --> 05:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
concurrently harvesting seaweed or kelp
 
05:56:47.090 --> 05:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
for for food we have had some interest
 
05:56:49.910 --> 05:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
in doing that I don't I think it was
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
they were looking at other applications
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
like cosmetics and maybe even like a
 
05:56:57.170 --> 05:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
brewery that was looking into it but
 
05:57:00.650 --> 05:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
currently it's it's it and if we were to
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
have seaweed or calpe would fall more
 
05:57:04.190 --> 05:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
into our food program versus that
 
05:57:06.770 --> 05:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
aquaculture that's purely molluscan
 
05:57:06.780 --> 05:57:08.270 align:start position:0%
aquaculture that's purely molluscan
shellfish

05:57:08.270 --> 05:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
shellfish
 
05:57:11.090 --> 05:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:13.128 --> 05:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:57:13.138 --> 05:57:14.810 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
pecenza

05:57:14.810 --> 05:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
pecenza
 
05:57:16.910 --> 05:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
so just a quick question I think it was
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
about three years ago or so it was um a
 
05:57:22.510 --> 05:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
very well-known 100 year old restaurant
 
05:57:26.208 --> 05:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and they had like a
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
foodborne illness that actually caused a
 
05:57:29.930 --> 05:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
death through their
 
05:57:29.940 --> 05:57:30.670 align:start position:0%
death through their
um

05:57:30.670 --> 05:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:33.048 --> 05:57:33.058 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in the restaurant it was like
 
05:57:35.930 --> 05:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
in their banquet portion
 
05:57:38.570 --> 05:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
the back room the Puritan I'm sure so is
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
that does that get reported to you guys
 
05:57:43.730 --> 05:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
or how does I was just wondering so
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
so yes we weren't directly involved in
 
05:57:49.010 --> 05:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
that investigation because it happened
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
in one of the the self-inspecting cities
 
05:57:54.048 --> 05:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
so when a a foodborne outbreak happens
 
05:57:56.750 --> 05:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
they take the lead in that instance we
 
05:57:59.390 --> 05:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
support them certainly our Infectious
 
05:58:01.610 --> 05:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
Disease Control folks those that are
 
05:58:03.470 --> 05:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
doing the disease surveillance and our
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
nurses were more directly involved than
 
05:58:08.448 --> 05:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
than our section but it was the man was
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester and that's took the lead on
 
05:58:12.410 --> 05:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
doing that environmental investigation
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:58:17.510 --> 05:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
