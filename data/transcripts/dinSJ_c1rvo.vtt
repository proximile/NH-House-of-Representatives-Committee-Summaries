was retained on a 10 to 10
 
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.630 align:start position:0%

earlier this year
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the request originating in Goffstown
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
to allow additional background checks to
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
be done on a periodic basis
 
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.250 align:start position:0%
be done on a periodic basis
and

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.170 align:start position:0%

uh I guess open it up for discussion
 
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
first if uh anyone wants to comment on
 
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.070 align:start position:0%
first if uh anyone wants to comment on
um

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
their recollection of the hearings and
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh the focus of the bill
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
if anyone want to start the uh
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
conversations and I see we also have the
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
uh Prime sponsor here
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you thank
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
you um I I understand
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
um and sympathize with the discussion
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
that came in the hearing where some
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
people had not had back criminal history
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
checks for 10 years or so
 
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.810 align:start position:0%
checks for 10 years or so
um

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
but I also think that this is kind of
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
too loosey-goosey that um
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
that they may choose to require a
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
criminal history records check in any
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
group of employees on a more frequent
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
occurring basis I think that
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
that whole statement needs to be
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
tightened up to be more prescriptive
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
than it is right now
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
um I I just can't support it the way it
 
00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:50.269 align:start position:0%
um I I just can't support it the way it
is

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else to represent Luna sure thank
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.440 --> 00:12:30.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay so I wouldn't so you're saying it
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
shouldn't include a whole group of
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I I rather than a group of
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
employees which is sort of uh
 
00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
employees which is sort of uh
um

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh I I think a squishy type of type
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
thing like I I don't know what that
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
group would be you know
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
um and um and do it on a do it on a
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
basis that and that you know this
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
employee has had not been subject to a
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
criminal background check when they were
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
hired and maybe it's that
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
um uh maybe that's the standard I don't
 
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
um uh maybe that's the standard I don't
know

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
I like the fact that it's a group that
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
sort of maintains the anonymity it's not
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily for someone who hasn't had
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
one but to more frequently do it and
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
overall this is just a permissive kind
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
of Bill it allows you to do it it's not
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
requiring anything so
 
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.530 align:start position:0%
requiring anything so
um

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
as it's worded I don't have
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
May May the employee the employing
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
school administrative Unit School May 2
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
may choose to require May that word may
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
instead of must require would I so
 
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's just my take on it so that's why
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
isn't this something that could be more
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
a local control that if a if a district
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
or it's a school department wants to
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate it with their employees they
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
could put it into negotiations that they
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
may require
 
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that it might require
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
something in statute to to allow that
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
also to enable that
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Noble anything
 
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.410 align:start position:0%
um representative Noble anything
uh

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
off the top I mean from what I remember
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
the group was included so that no one
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Alexander would you be
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
willing to come up and uh refresh our
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
memories on some of the background and
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the legislation the
 
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.310 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the legislation the
intent

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me the subcommittee
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Joe Alexander
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
I represent Goffstown so just to refresh
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
the memory of what this what the intent
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill is
 
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.689 align:start position:0%
of this bill is
um

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
my superintendent was concerned that he
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to or
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
during contract negotiations at some
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
time he may want more frequent
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
background checks than the one in law
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
that's required I Believe by the doe
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
when you obtain a license and the doe is
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
here so all he wants to do is have
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that would allow him to
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
during contract negotiations with a
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
union any union doesn't matter who it is
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to put in to have more frequent
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
background checks than just the one that
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
they get so that was really the intent
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
of it there's no requirement he just
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
wants to have that ability to include it
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
in the negotiations
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
and that is also doe is here I believe
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
as well to uh give some information if
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
you want to you know what the background
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
checks would include and things like
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
and all what and also the idea was to
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
not single out any one employee so yeah
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
like after a contract negotiate like
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
after a union contracts approved maybe
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
everybody goes and gets background
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
checks that we're not singling out any
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
one teacher because that's not what we
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
want to do sorry so that was the purpose
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
of adding group
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
and I think representative Luna I think
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
you you have a good point is that you
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
know you can put put a year on it if you
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
want I mean that that we just want the
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
intent of being able to have that
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
um Miss Fenton from the Department of um
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is Diana
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
Fenton I'm with the Department of
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
Education but um I was also asked by the
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety to fill in for them
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
because they're all at a conference this
 
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.049 align:start position:0%
because they're all at a conference this
week

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I usually hesitate to speak on behalf
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Safety but I'm
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
willing to do it today but the caveat is
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
I if I give any misinformation I
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
apologize ahead of time I also asked the
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
department of safety if I since I was
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
speaking on their behalf if I could have
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
a hat and a badge and a cruiser and I
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
was denied so I would just like to put
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
not even that I didn't even get the Hat
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
nothing so
 
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.130 align:start position:0%
nothing so
um

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:06.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
as the previous testimony was uh this is
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
not a bill brought on behalf of the
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we are aware of
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
it and I worked with the superintendent
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
from Goffstown
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding of his thought process
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
was just
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to negotiate with the Union
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of routine background
 
00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of routine background
check

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
the reason it has to be in statute is
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
because the FBI requires statutory
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
language in order to disseminate the
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
record to a school district
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason that it would have
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
to be in law and I I have anecdotally
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
over the years I've had superintendents
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
truly a handful no more than five
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
expressed to me the concern of you know
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
someone's employed in the school
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
district they are subject to one
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
background check and then that's it and
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
I would like the ability to do that on a
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
more routine frequent basis that's not a
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Education issue that's an
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
employment issue and that's kind of the
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
the reason it is before you I do recall
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
last year looking at the language
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and representative luno to your point
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
my concern looking at the language was
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
that this not become a weapon
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
that a superintendent can use to Target
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
one individual
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
I think in looking at the language it's
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
important to just make it applicable on
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
a on a consistent basis pick a number
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
three years five years ten years that's
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
that's up to this committee to decide
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
that it is applicable across the board
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
to a group
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
my concern in looking at the language
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
would just be that it could be used to
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
Target a certain individual which
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
certainly I think would go against the
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
intent of the underlying bill and the
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
intent of of this committee so I just
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
put that up there as as kind of food for
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
thought if you will
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair thanks very
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
much Miss Fenton
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
um yeah and and good point I and I and I
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
just to sort of clarify my my earlier
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
thoughts I wasn't thinking
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
um necessarily specific individual but
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
specific individuals that
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
have not had a criminal background check
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
in a certain number of years so rather
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
than all teachers or all support staff
 
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.430 align:start position:0%
than all teachers or all support staff
or

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
all select group that you know that that
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
has some other you know identifying
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
factor that the identifying factor or
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
the qualifying Factor would be have not
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
completed a criminal background check in
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years 20 years 30 years
 
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.100 align:start position:0%
whatever that um that that
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
qualifying Factor uh is uh but uh
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
question is what what are other states
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
doing with respect to this um
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
um type of situation
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to represent all states
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
I think that in New Hampshire the focus
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
was always heavily on employment the
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
background check historically was a
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
function of employment now is this
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee is well aware that is the
 
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
function that is shared with the
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
Department of Education upon licensure
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I think with Most states it is
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
divided there is the background check
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
upon licensure and then there is that
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
employment piece as well
 
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.430 align:start position:0%
employment piece as well
um

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
I think historically because we've had
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
so many changes in this area of the law
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
I mean RSA 189 13A was dormant for many
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
many years it was dormant and this
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
committee has undertaken a lot of time
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
in looking at it understanding it I know
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner has put a lot of
 
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
effort into that Statute in particular
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
and really trying to identify the weak
 
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.549 align:start position:0%
and really trying to identify the weak
areas

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
I think what this bill does and I don't
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
think the language is quite there yet I
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
think there are some really big concerns
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
with the language but the idea behind it
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
is empowering superintendents to have
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
that conversation with the Union to say
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate what does this look
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
like can we you know come to terms and
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the provisions is that
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
for individuals who did not have a
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
background check upon employment
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
and I think we can all agree that is
 
00:22:51.659 --> 00:22:52.909 align:start position:0%
and I think we can all agree that is
concerning

00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to it
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
and then you build in another provision
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
which allows superintendents to have a
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Union to say what
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
does this look like can we come up with
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
terms of three years five years
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
something something like that
 
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.810 align:start position:0%
something something like that
um

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to look at what other states
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
are doing in this area but I think
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that it is a split
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
it is a balance between credentialing or
 
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.250 align:start position:0%
it is a balance between credentialing or
licensure

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:26.810 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
so thanks Mr Mr chairs thank you very
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
much John
 
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.190 align:start position:0%
much John
um

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:35.539 align:start position:0%
and I and I appreciate the the
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
clarification you've made with between
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
employment and credentialing and that
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
this section is is related to employment
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
not absolutely not not credentialing
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and and but I want to I want to
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
direct a question to your comment about
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
the the language and um and I was
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
help interpret
 
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.810 align:start position:0%
help interpret
um

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
the the the language that's in in there
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
may choose to require
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
the that part may choose to require
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um on any group
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
School District to to put that
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirement in a into a collective
 
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:37.940 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement during negotiation
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
or it would enable a school district to
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
require criminal back criminal history
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
checks may choose to require criminal
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
history checks any group of employees
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
um uh outside of uh the collective
 
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement outside of the
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
terms agreed to in a collective
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think the bill as written is is too
 
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.549 align:start position:0%
I think the bill as written is is too
generalized

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
generalized
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
my concern as I expressed earlier is
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
that it would be misapplied throughout
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state and you need to have that
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
consistency it has to be a little bit
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
more explicit
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
as to what this legislature's intent is
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
so if the intent is to allow
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
superintendents to enter into
 
00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:44.330 align:start position:0%
superintendents to enter into
negotiations

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
to allow for more frequent background
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
checks then I think that's what needs to
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
be stated I think you have to have two
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
Provisions one that says if it is the
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
consensus of this committee the concern
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
to address individuals who were not
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
subject to a background check upon
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
employment that's concerning I think we
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
can all agree to that that might be one
 
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.690 align:start position:0%
can all agree to that that might be one
provision

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
and then the second provision and that's
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
I think few and far individuals right
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
this is going back a certain number of
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
years this is not thousands and
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
thousands of people
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
maybe hundreds
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people are going into
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
retirement so we can address that
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
concern and then there's a different
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
subsection that talks about allowing a
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent again employment
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
explicitly employment nothing to do with
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
having the superintendent have the
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
ability to enter into a negotiation with
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
a union to discuss
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
if background checks will be done on a
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
more frequent basis and put some time
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
frames in there right
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
three years five years ten years you can
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
give some structure to that
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
that will allow the dissemination of the
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
record from the Department of Safety to
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
the school district so you take care of
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
that piece of it and then you allow that
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
local control piece
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
as written I think this language is
 
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.450 align:start position:0%
as written I think this language is
concerning

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
that being said I'm sure there's someone
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
out there on the YouTube feed that is
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
saying to me yes but miss Fenton you
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
wrote it and that's probably true as
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
well and there are times where I look
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
back at my work and go well that's not
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
very good as I've said to my boss when
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like my work I'm not a robot
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
Frank sometimes I write bad things so I
 
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:33.740 align:start position:0%
think I did help with this language
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
honestly as I sit here today the
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
language concerns me I don't think it's
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time as this committee
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
has said
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
and I think my biggest concern is if you
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
give generic General language you get
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistent results throughout the
 
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.690 align:start position:0%
inconsistent results throughout the
state

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
and that's what we see at the department
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
level and that is hard to get ahead of
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to claw that back
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to to I mean obviously this
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee is more than just
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative luno but I'm happy to try
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
to try to craft some language which
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
would address the concerns
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
could I could I ask
 
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.769 align:start position:0%
could I could I ask
um

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the changes to the statute
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
over the past few years and I think one
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
of those uh changes if I'm not mistaken
 
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.990 align:start position:0%
of those uh changes if I'm not mistaken
was

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
um to allow
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
um looking and I'm not sure if that
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
covers the employment or the
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
credentialing side of things to look at
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
um offenses maybe where there was uh not
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
a conviction yes but
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
um and also a look at um uh maybe uh
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
um uh convictions that were pleaded down
 
00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.039 align:start position:0%
um to misdemeanor levels
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
many employees I'm sure had a background
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
check prior to those changes so I would
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
see maybe those circumstances also being
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
changed or incorporated into this so
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
that any new check was or checks could
 
00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:14.659 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.020 align:start position:0%
in line with the current statute
 
00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:21.860 align:start position:0%
so that we pick up those
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
individuals who maybe have had a longer
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
employment history
 
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.950 align:start position:0%
employment history
um

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
as well your thoughts on that
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that's a very valid point
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
to raise and I appreciate you reminding
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
me of it
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
um it is worth reminding this committee
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
that less than 10 years ago what was
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
released for employment purposes from
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety was simply a
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
letter and the letter simply stated the
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
candidate and I will just use Glenn
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
cordelli as an example Glenn cordelli
 
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
applied to be a teacher at SAU 39
 
00:30:03.529 --> 00:30:03.539 align:start position:0%
Mr cordelli does have a section 5
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
violation which is one of the
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offenses and cannot be
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
hired or he does not and he can be hired
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
but there was no information as to what
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
that offense might be or how long ago it
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
was or what
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
what it looked like I I really called
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
them the red light green light letter
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
because that what it that's what it was
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
it was the department of safety that
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
would call through an individual's
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
record and they would type out this
 
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.409 align:start position:0%
record and they would type out this
letter

00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
there was a case in which a gentleman
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
was charged with very serious sexual
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
offenses felony level for whatever
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
reason they were pled down to
 
00:30:41.399 --> 00:30:43.010 align:start position:0%
reason they were pled down to
misdemeanors

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
he applied at a school district
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety typed out the
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
letter that said he does not have a
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
section 5 violation and he didn't
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
he didn't
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
he had some concerning things on his
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
record but he did not have a section 5
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
violation he was hired he reoffended and
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's what was brought to this
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
committee's attention
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
and that is what prompted the change in
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
the law to shift that responsibility
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety to the
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
district itself because it is the
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
district that has the liability give
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
that responsibility to the district and
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
release more information
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
so you are correct what was done 10 15
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
20 years ago is in stark contrast to the
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
procedure we have in place today and so
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
what might have to be put in there is
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
some language about grandfathering in
 
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.690 align:start position:0%
some language about grandfathering in
individuals

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
who might have some of those offenses
 
00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:48.110 align:start position:0%
who might have some of those offenses
that

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
the depart the district
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
would look upon as troubling
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think that goes all the way
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
back there was a
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it was a study committee
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
or a commission chaired by Senator Ward
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
where we got into that that whole letter
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
um a number of different groups involved
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
in that and I I think that was really
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
the start of what has happened since
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
then in terms of tightening up the
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
background check process the criminal
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
records check process this committee has
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
put an enormous amount of time and
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
effort into that area and again
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner was did a lot of
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
work on that it's a difficult area
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps and I I throw this out
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
Simply as a suggestion
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps the
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
perhaps the permissive language of
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
allowing a superintendent to work with
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
the Union to say we're going to have a
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
background check every three years or
 
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:51.539 align:start position:0%
every five years and again I'm just
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
throwing out numbers
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
um that background check is just limited
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
which would prohibit employment anywhere
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
and that way you take away perhaps a bit
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
of that arbitrariness
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
that could could apply and again these
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
are just simply suggestions as we kind
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
of bat the ideas back and forth but you
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
want to put in some structure
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
if this committee were to allow this
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
bill to move forward
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing will be a different bill but
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
you want to have that structure in there
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't get weaponized in the
 
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.130 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't get weaponized in the
field

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Tanner
 
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.690 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Tanner
I

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
I am having a couple of issues with this
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
one is that at one point in my career
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
from the dinosaur age to now I had
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
several background checks because when
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
we renewed our license with the State
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh which was
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
every three or five years
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
um at one point a criminal
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
history checked was part of that that
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
requirement and it was done through the
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
with this bill I and you've mentioned it
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
too it could be hodgepodge across the
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
state number one number two
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
I also worked in with negotiations in my
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
own school district and I just can't
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
imagine negotiating criminal background
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
checks when they're required and when
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
they're not who's going to pay for them
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
who's not
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
um because it seems like the state
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
either has a compelling interest
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
to provide criminal history checks to
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that kids are safe as safe as
 
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.220 align:start position:0%
we can possibly make it in our schools
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
across the state uh very uniformly or
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
um you know rather than it be a a
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
semi-political football on a
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
negotiations thing
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like why should
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Goffstown all of a sudden have every
 
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:03.020 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
required Background Checks In
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
cure Sarge maybe 10 years and maybe you
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
know and if you switch schools if you
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
were to be hired by two schools where
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
where do you fit within that limit and
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
even though it is an employment issue
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sure at some point it would
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
um speak to credentialing if all of a
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
sudden they came up with a section five
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh that all of a sudden there would be a
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
flag down at the State Department of
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
Education as far as credentials are
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
concerned as well is that true
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
that is accurate yes and in fact the way
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
the law is currently written putting
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
aside this bill that's in in front of
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration my
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if if the
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
employing school district reviews an
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
individual's record upon employment and
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
they find a section 5 disqualifying
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
offense then yes they are required to
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
notify the Department of Education the
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
reason being is that the Department's
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
position is that the department does not
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
want to license or credential an
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
individual who is unemployable that that
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
doesn't support the field that doesn't
 
00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:12.650 align:start position:0%
doesn't support the field that doesn't
support

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
child safety so you are correct that the
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
law currently has written nothing to do
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
with this proposed Bill superintendents
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to notify the
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
department if there is an applicant with
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
a section 5 violation yes
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
um representative could I just ask you
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
if if you're
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
you're thinking along the lines that
 
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
um if we amend this with new language
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that language should specify
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
a required period for all school
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
districts to do follow-up background
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
checks outside of
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
the contract negotiation process
 
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.370 align:start position:0%
the contract negotiation process
um

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes the I was not opposed to
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
getting background checks criminal
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
background history checks when you
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
renewed your license
 
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.609 align:start position:0%
renewed your license
um

00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:06.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
the the big thing became the price of it
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
and the fact that particularly for a new
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
teacher that uh gets that early renewal
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it you know
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
just like us when we're
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
earning a hundred dollars a year you
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
know uh the cost of a computer or even a
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
tablet uh takes away from that so uh
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
considerably and teachers are
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
drastically underpaid so
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
um I would say that rather than leave it
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
up to negotiations and leave it up to
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
the superintendent
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
um if it in my opinion if it were going
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh something that the state really
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
thought was important that definitely
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
um Representatives who knows piece that
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody is employed and has not had
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
a criminal history Tech
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is that is like a red flag I think
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
and and definitely I think we can all
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
agree to that but as far as the other
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
ones are concerned I think it's um
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
consistency across the state I don't
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
know how that goes with the Department
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
of Safety or whatever
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
you'd have to do an awful lot
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh chairman LED
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and while Diane and Sierra I
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
have a question for her but first it
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
appears to me in the 267 as written
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
could be used to Target rather and and
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
do it through as we might compare to the
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
kids misbehaving on the play yard you
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
line them all up against the wall or
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
just the one that needs to be lined up
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
against the wall that's causing the
 
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:45.980 align:start position:0%
issue so are we going to get around
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
dealing directly with an individual
 
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.569 align:start position:0%
dealing directly with an individual
by

00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
putting forth legislation that
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
encompasses the whole state and all all
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
my my other uh issue is that there's if
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's a negotiated agreement issue and it
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
is negotiated that say every three years
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
or four years or two years whatever that
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
you put in it is the time in which an
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
employee criminal background check is
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
required but what about the new employee
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
that just came in the year before and
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
just had a criminal background check are
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
they going to have to have another one
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
the second year after employment if it's
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
not in conjunction we watch in the
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
timeline in the negotiating agreement
 
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:31.700 align:start position:0%
and who pays and who pays for this
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be a local issue
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the last thing
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
um Diana is there any
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
is this a
 
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:43.940 align:start position:0%
is this issue
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
identified or is there a path towards
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
um dealing with uh the issue of why
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
you're having a criminal background
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
check through the code of ethics uh does
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics for example we know
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
there's a number of disciplinary steps
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
there and we've also recommended in the
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
past are discussed the possibility of a
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
fourth step that's initial before all
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
those other three steps and Brian's here
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
and he knows what I'm talking about
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
so and and lastly
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it says coming forth from the
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
administrators Association or is this
 
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
then just a singular administrator in
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
this state saying here I need this in
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
order to get things done
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
the way I like to do it in my district
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
so those are all questions but I'd like
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
to know is there any relationship
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
between the code of ethics and and does
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics uh if there's
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
something going on is that going to be
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
caught by the code of ethics and and
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
something can be done that Avenue with
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
an investigation
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
so under the code of of conduct under
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct if an individual is
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
arrested for one of those disqualifying
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
offenses they have an obligation to
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
and that's the only overlap on the
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
criminal records piece and the code of
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
um this again this bill was not brought
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
forward on behalf of the Department of
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
Education it was brought forward by the
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
Goffstown superintendent and just
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotally as I testified before I've
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
had a handful a very small number less
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
than five superintendents over the
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
course of my tenure at the Department of
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
Education just Express
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
a an interest in the ability to conduct
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
a background check on a more frequent
 
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.069 align:start position:0%
a background check on a more frequent
basis

00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
um truly a small number of people I
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to over exaggerate that at
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
all but it is uh a discussion that that
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
is out there but this is not to my
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
understanding not brought on behalf of
 
00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:47.579 align:start position:0%
the Superintendent's Association it was
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
just a superintendent from Goffstown
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Miler I was wondering
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
if you had any um follow-up because I
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
think you were one of the first people
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the hearing to raise the subject of
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
excuse my sunglasses but I just had my
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
eyes dilated so I'm having a hard time
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
seeing and focusing at this point in
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
time I think the the issue of the
 
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.609 align:start position:0%
time I think the the issue of the
inconsistency

00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
clearly the issue of negotiating this at
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
the local level is all has always been
 
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.490 align:start position:0%
the local level is all has always been
there

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
and so my concern has been if we were to
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
negotiate this at the local level of the
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
the point that Ms Fenton mentioned the
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
inconsistency that would be across the
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
state I think would be a problem my
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
sense is particularly with the last
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
comment that the
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
Ms Fenton said this has not really been
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
that big of an issue other than within
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
this particular school district and So
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
based upon what the representative
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
laddin just said
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
I don't see any why we would pursue this
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
from a state standpoint and this should
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
be dealt with on an issue by issue basis
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
based upon whatever the behavior might
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
be of a particular employee particularly
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
dealing with the code of conduct and Etc
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of where I see
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
this thing going thank you
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes I I guess I just have a question
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
about cost
 
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:23.300 align:start position:0%
um and online four and five it says
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
applicant for employment in any position
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
so to me that is at any position as that
 
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:32.780 align:start position:0%
teachers Paris
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
cafeteria everything and if you're going
 
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
to require it are you requiring all
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
these people to pay for it themselves or
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
is the school district going to pay for
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
it because in Manchester if you're going
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
to require the school district to pay
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
for everybody to get uh
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
a criminal check every so many years
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's an awful lot of money with 2 000
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
Educators and then powers and then bus
 
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
drivers and cafeteria people and I'm not
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
going to vote for downshifting costs to
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
my school district for that amount of
 
00:44:06.599 --> 00:44:07.430 align:start position:0%
my school district for that amount of
money

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
or to to Paris who make 15 an hour to
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
have to get a criminal background track
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
um is there a general Sense on the
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.650 align:start position:0%
committee that
um

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
well I guess uh represent Miler even
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
raised it whether we need this
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
legislation or not or that's question
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
number one and two
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
um if we feel that something is needed
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
um do we want to work on some amending
 
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.250 align:start position:0%
um do we want to work on some amending
language

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:45.260 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
and come back to review amending
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
I would just have one more question that
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.030 align:start position:0%
I would just have one more question that
if

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
if a school district had found an
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
employee that had not had a criminal
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
background check uh without this without
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
this RSA would they be able to require
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
part of their employment at that
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
particular time to get a criminal
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they would the reason
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
being is that the law is clear that it's
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
upon employment and I think the second
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
layer to that is that the department of
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
not be able to disseminate the federal
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
record to the school district because
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
they have to follow
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
what the law says and the federal
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
background check can only be
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
disseminated to another governmental
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
entity in very limited circumstances
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
there has to be statutory language that
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
allows for that release I think so I
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be prohibited so so if if
 
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'm a superintendent and I'm hiring
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh let's say
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
um a custodial or cafeteria help that
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:04.849 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
um

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
and they have to get criminal background
 
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.750 align:start position:0%
and they have to get criminal background
checks

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
checks
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.630 align:start position:0%
yes yes
so

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.609 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
if somebody their their employment their
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
terms of employment are yearly I would
 
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
assume uh they're they don't go under
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
contract under for example like a
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
teacher's contract that would be two
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
three years I would assume maybe I'm
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
assuming wrongly that a person that's
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
employed by a school district is on a
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
yearly basis so they are technically uh
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
they don't get paid over the summer so
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
their employment ends at the end of the
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
school year or July 1st when the school
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
year ends and then their employment
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
picks up in September so technically
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
they're re-employed
 
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.190 align:start position:0%
they're re-employed
um

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
and at that point couldn't the
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
superintendent require that they take a
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
criminal background check rather than
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
write a law that
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
that requires it I mean isn't aren't
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
they hiring them and therefore as their
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
employer they could require the criminal
 
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
employer they could require the criminal
history

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
check I I will be honest with you
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I am not involved
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
in those contract negotiations in any
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
way shape or form it falls completely
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
out of the purview of my job I know very
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
little about employment law I know two
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
things I like being employed and I don't
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
like when I'm not employed please
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
forgive the double negative
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
um I I really am not the person to speak
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
to when it comes to employment law
 
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.550 align:start position:0%
to when it comes to employment law
um

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what a staff person's
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
contract looks like I've never seen one
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
but it's not what the department gets
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe that a custodian's
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
contract ends in June and picks up again
 
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
in September but honestly I really don't
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
know I've never heard of that I've never
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
received that inquiry from the field
 
00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.609 align:start position:0%
received that inquiry from the field
um

00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
I suppose that a superintendent could do
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
that to say well you're re-employed in
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
September and we're going to do a
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
background check I've never had that
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
fact pattern come before me I think
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
that particular fact pattern of an
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
individual who has been employed in the
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
district for 20 30 years prior to a
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
background check who was not subject
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
subject to a background check is a very
 
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.809 align:start position:0%
subject to a background check is a very
small

00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
piece of the population it's an
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
important piece of the population and I
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
believe that this committee could could
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
address it and solve that issue but it
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
has to be very narrowly tailored to that
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
particular issue and I don't think the
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
issue is with a custodian or a cafeteria
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
worker the concern as expressed from
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
these the sponsor and the superintendent
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
who is behind this is that that very
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
small group of Educators who have been
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
in the field for a long time who just
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
were employed before the background
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
there's a little
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
so so I you know I think what
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner brings up is is is
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
an important
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
um point though that that
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
could actually have some bearing on the
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
laws it's written right now I'm also not
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
quite sure why it wouldn't apply to
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
custodians and other other employees
 
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.250 align:start position:0%
custodians and other other employees
because

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:25.970 align:start position:0%
because
um

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
um we know that
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
students certainly get get get guidance
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
and support and it's not from you know
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
teachers but also you know Food Service
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
employees and custodians as well and it
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
should be applicable to them as well I
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that that is all
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
employment but I think the individual
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
who brought this law forward
 
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
his focus and again I don't want to
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
testify on his behalf but I think what
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
he expressed to this committee was his
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
concern was more about the the educator
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
who had been employed for that right so
 
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
not to say that it couldn't be right
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
right but going back to representative
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
Tanner's point on on that and and you
 
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
know again this is this is only you know
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
from school board experience not
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
um but you know I was chair for eight
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
years and I've signed a lot of contracts
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
and teacher contracts go year to year is
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
um so it's almost like your
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
you're I mean yeah you're you're
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
certainly compounding the number of
 
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
years on there but it's a year to year
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
right um you know um
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
contract and and how
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
at least it wasn't our district and and
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
how does that
 
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.690 align:start position:0%
how does that
um

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
if I can sort of find it how does it
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
comport with the law comport with the
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
with the with the current law
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
um uh when it when it talks about with
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
the final offer of employment subject to
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
successfully completed Chris
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
um criminal history records check if
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
that offer of employment is indeed that
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
contract that begins July 1st
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and ends June 30th begins July 1st if
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
they hadn't completed a criminal
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
background check in their history of of
 
00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:20.569 align:start position:0%
background check in their history of of
employment

00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
um could that could the existing law
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
provide the language that's necessary
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
for a school board to say hey you know
 
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.490 align:start position:0%
for a school board to say hey you know
what

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
um the you know these employees
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
were hired prior to the requirement
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting interpretation of
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
the law I don't think that's how
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
I only play one on TV
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I I think that it's an interesting
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
interpretation I don't think that's how
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
the field interprets it I'd be kind of
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
interested Brian
 
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.910 align:start position:0%
interested Brian
right

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
it had not been subject
 
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
understood understood again it's an
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
interesting interpretation I don't know
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
if the department of safety would feel
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable releasing the record based
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
upon that interpretation this is where
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'm limited as to how much I can speak
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Department of Safety
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
I've never heard that interpretation
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
from the field as seeing it as kind of a
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
year to year now we have to run the
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
record again
 
00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
record again
amazing

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.390 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
I again
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
I I'm here on behalf of Department of
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
Safety but not really
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that would pass
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
muster for the Federal Regulations
 
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.829 align:start position:0%
muster for the Federal Regulations
correct

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:48.500 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations
 
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
they're kind of the Department of Safety
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
works at their behest right and they're
 
00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.700 align:start position:0%
under very intense scrutiny from them
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
represent school districts starting to
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
have a number of employees which are on
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
stipend or coming in doing intramural
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
activities or through contracted
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
services with an agency of some kind
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
how would this change right here where
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
we put into a negotiated agreement for
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
example that every two three years we're
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to do this work with the
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
contracted employees
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
that are coming in those contracted
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
teachers through the agency
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
they would have to they would have to
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
address that in their contract
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
negotiations I I don't even know if it
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
would really affect those contractors
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
those kind of short-term contract
 
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.670 align:start position:0%
those kind of short-term contract
positions

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
so we're Contracting Services for
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
nursing in many school districts
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely contractors so this is for a
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
multitude of issues
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
so obviously within that contract the
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
school board the administrator is going
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
to say we want to make sure people come
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
in and have that criminal background
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
check yes however uh if we also have not
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
by uh negotiated agreement this issue
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it every two or three
 
00:54:01.319 --> 00:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it every two or three
years

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
is how do we ensure that that employee
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's coming or that person that's
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
employed by the contract and service is
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
I would think that that contracted
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
position would really fall outside of
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
the purview of what is before this
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee I think what is it before this
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
for those
 
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.089 align:start position:0%
for those
full-time

00:54:31.089 --> 00:54:31.099 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
long-term employees of the district and
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
the ability to negotiate with the Union
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
as to the opportunity to conduct a
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
background check on a more frequent
 
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.910 align:start position:0%
background check on a more frequent
basis

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I think a school nurse coming in on
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
a contract for
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
a specified period of time would fall
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
outside of that
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
and further questions for Miss Fenton
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah kind of for her and kind of a
 
00:54:59.770 --> 00:54:59.780 align:start position:0%
comment so I
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
started teaching in 69 and I had to have
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks and I'm you
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
know up there in the years I can't
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
imagine that anybody's still teaching
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
that didn't get a required background
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
check in the first place
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
um because it never stopped I mean it
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
was required a little bit more often for
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
a while but then it never stopped
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so I I find it hard number one to
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
believe that there are teachers
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
within the school district who are
 
00:55:38.049 --> 00:55:38.059 align:start position:0%
credentialed teachers
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
who have not had a criminal background
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
check okay number one and is that would
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
that be pretty
 
00:55:50.049 --> 00:55:50.059 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that reasoning
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
these based on what you just said yes I
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
would agree with that I'm I myself am
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that amount of History
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
I can just talk to about the past 10
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
years or so
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
um but based on what you just presented
 
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree with you and the other
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
thing is that it seems like from our
 
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
thing is that it seems like from our
discussion

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
that this bill is targeted only to those
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
people who have a negotiated contract
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
with the Union
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and from our discussion with uh
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
chairman lab about the contracted
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
Services outside talking about the
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
janitors or the
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
um you know cafeteria workers so really
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
the bill is targeted at people who are
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
under under uh negotiated contract and
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
in that case really you know putting
 
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
those two things together I feel as
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
though this bill is totally unnecessary
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:56:49.079 --> 00:56:50.690 align:start position:0%
at this point
so

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
quickly oh okay um
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
so I mean this was brought forth because
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
a superintendent felt the need for it I
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's likely it's not just that
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
this idea was brought forth there was
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
obviously someone in a leadership
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
position feeling some sort of need so I
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
I do see some purpose I always look for
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
that you know in legislation what is the
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
purpose now you you wrote this my
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
concern right now in voting for it is is
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
that there is a vagueness with this on a
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
more frequent
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
or recurring basis that that more
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
frequent like some sort of amending
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
language where it would ensure that it
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be you know weaponized or
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
targeting someone because more frequent
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
could mean every year you know you want
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of guard rails to it
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking it's a good idea but
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
with some sort of amendment mending
 
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.030 align:start position:0%
with some sort of amendment mending
language

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of getting the sense that
 
00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:52.579 align:start position:0%
um we're going to need a second
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
um getting sense there might be some new
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
language uh brought forward in terms of
 
00:58:02.569 --> 00:58:02.579 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
um uh but at the same time some feeling
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
that uh maybe
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
um uh the bill isn't required at all
 
00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:12.790 align:start position:0%
um uh the bill isn't required at all
um

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
would the committee uh be in agreement
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
that a second meeting is required
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
I I from what reptiana said if it
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
started when she started in 1969 that
 
00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
means people would have been working now
 
00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:32.540 align:start position:0%
for 54 years and I don't know how many
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
educators are still out there that have
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
been there for 54 years or more
 
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:39.770 align:start position:0%
been there for 54 years or more
um

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that this is that we
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
need to do this you know and
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
for a handful of there could have been a
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
teacher in Goffstown that the
 
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.010 align:start position:0%
teacher in Goffstown that the
superintendent

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
thinks but has been there more than 54
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
years they never or they somehow slipped
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
by without getting their criminal check
 
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.049 align:start position:0%
by without getting their criminal check
but

00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't seem like it's could
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
it maybe have a straw poll just those
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
who do not think that this bill is
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
needed uh versus those who think that
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
um uh there should be some amending
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
language and that we should look at that
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
um that option
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
um how many at this point think that the
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
bill is not needed at all
 
00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:28.750 align:start position:0%
bill is not needed at all
yeah

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
and those that think there should be
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
some amending language and there is a
 
00:59:33.359 --> 00:59:35.329 align:start position:0%
some amending language and there is a
need

00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:40.089 --> 00:59:40.099 align:start position:0%
so I guess we're
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
funny about that isn't it
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
um well that's um since it is uh uh the
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
first motion in the house floor is
 
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
always a positive one so let's
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
um uh have a second meeting and we can
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
further discuss
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the need and maybe someone will bring
 
01:00:02.329 --> 01:00:02.339 align:start position:0%
forth some uh um maybe we can work on
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
some amending language and we've had an
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
offer from uh Ms Fenton to to help in
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
that regard as well
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
and we find out the need for this bill
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
I mean can we actually maybe find it I I
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
so and and Mr chair in in addition to um
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
putting some
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
putting together some some proposed new
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
language as as attorney Fenton has
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
suggested that that that you know you
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
know put some some you know time frames
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
on this like whether it's every five
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
years or every 10 years or has not been
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
conducted in 10 years so you know
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily apply to every
 
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
employee if they had one conducted two
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
years ago when they were hired
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know some some something
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
something like that but also to make
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
that this is a provision that could be
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
negotiated into a collective bargaining
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
agreement and not applied unilaterally
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
by the school board outside of a
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
um as discussed there could be uh two or
 
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.970 align:start position:0%
um as discussed there could be uh two or
three

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.809 align:start position:0%
three
um

01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh points uh to be made in an amendment
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
as to the negotiations as you just said
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know I would just want to see you
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
know what that what that language you
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
know could look like the only criminal
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
backgrounds checked that can be
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
unilaterally applied by the school board
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
outside of uh uh collective bargaining
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
agreement uh is the initial
 
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
um application during the application
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
for hiring and that's obviously very
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
important because the the prospective
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
employee is not subject to a collective
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
bargaining uh uh agreement at that point
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
and that includes the superintendent on
 
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
on down so
 
01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.190 align:start position:0%
on down so
okay

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
um so we will chairman Ladd I would
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
encourage this subcommittee to come out
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
with something other than a 3-3 vote on
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
um it's there are issues to been brought
 
01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
up today we've had the department
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
indicate that the language as is stated
 
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
in this bill right now is not right
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
we need to get something corrected there
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that it is it targets
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
the way it is right now I'm also
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about a large District like a
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester might get into this business
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
what are those costs going to be for
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
every employee thrown on them or on the
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
individual so if it's on the individual
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
teachers we already have a teacher
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
shortage now we're going to just make it
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
a little more costly for these teachers
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
saying I don't want to get into this
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
business I have to take one the criminal
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
background check when I'm in school
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
become a teacher upon getting out of it
 
01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
and going student teaching I have to
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
take it when I get employed and now I'm
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
going to have to have another one here
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
that we're starting to chop the money up
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
here and I think we've got to be very
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
cautious in that regard and I'd also
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
like to have the subcommittee do a
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
thorough check with the school
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
administrators Association find out is
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
this a bill that's supported by them is
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
it supported by the school boards
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
Association and let's let's get a handle
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
on this thing before we start change
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
teaching state law to maybe impact a few
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
that there are ways which we can still
 
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
deal with the few rather than having to
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
put another Statute in place
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.289 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
so can we
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
um not on a 3-3 basis but uh can we
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
agree on a subsequent meeting
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
um to further discuss this and possible
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh amendments that might be brought
 
01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:12.049 align:start position:0%
uh amendments that might be brought
forward

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.059 --> 01:04:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll schedule another meeting
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I'll play into conjunction with some
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
of the other meetings that we have on
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
our calendar
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
um and we have one other bill that we
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
have to take a look at
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 628
 
01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:32.750 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 628
um

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
requiring certain non-public schools or
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
education service providers that accept
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
public funds to perform background
 
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
checks on all employees and volunteers
 
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.049 align:start position:0%
checks on all employees and volunteers
um

01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:45.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
this one also there was uh
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit of discussion and
 
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
testimony as I recall
 
01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:54.859 align:start position:0%
um and a number of
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
issues raised again relating to
 
01:04:58.319 --> 01:05:01.250 align:start position:0%
issues raised again relating to
employment

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and who has actually covered
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
um under the proposed uh legislation
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
someone like to start the conversations
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm the prime sponsor
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
um and when the bill was
 
01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:21.109 align:start position:0%
um and when the bill was
um

01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
offered uh I think one of the
 
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
things that that
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
came to me that I would like to work on
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
providing an amendment is that in no way
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
did I mean
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
or intend that a parent who homeschools
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
their child in their own home
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
would need to be
 
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.829 align:start position:0%
would need to be
um

01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
receive uh or do a criminal history
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
background check that was that was not
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
my intent and I would like to expressly
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
put that in the bill itself
 
01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
um but on the other hand
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that we're making we
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
have to start making distinct
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
distinctions about children that are
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
actually being educated under the EFA
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
law and the student scholarship
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
organization receiving
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayer resource funding through State
 
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.190 align:start position:0%
taxpayer resource funding through State
funding

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
that it is a compelling interest of the
 
01:06:24.119 --> 01:06:25.210 align:start position:0%
that it is a compelling interest of the
state

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:25.220 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
for the safety of children
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
that people dealing with those children
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
in a school setting
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
um be required to do criminal background
 
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh we had someone that came in from a
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
co-op that gave an example if if you
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
have six parents teaching in that Co-op
 
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
say there's 25 kids and just one of
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
those kids is getting an EFA
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
are you thinking that all they all need
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
to get background check now
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
if that Co-op
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
accepts EFA money as tuition
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
then yes they and and they do have
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
people hired or people that are
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers on a regular basis for the
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
children in that particular setting yes
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
I think so I mean it's it's
 
01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:27.829 align:start position:0%
I think so I mean it's it's
um

01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:29.809 --> 01:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's the compelling
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the state
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
I mean it's in in the interest of the
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
parents as well for them to be safe and
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
they're choosing to be part of that
 
01:07:42.119 --> 01:07:43.010 align:start position:0%
they're choosing to be part of that
Co-op

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
Co-op
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't see the issue of
 
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
needing a background check if there
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
they're choosing to be part of that
 
01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
Co-op these are people that they Trust
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's trust and then verify
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know I know people
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
um that I thought I knew
 
01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
um that I thought I knew
that

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
that we're not
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
um as trustworthy in the end that I
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
thought they were and
 
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
um to the detriment of children
 
01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.729 align:start position:0%
um to the detriment of children
so

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yeah you
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
know that we we um you know parents make
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
decisions to send their their children
 
01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.430 align:start position:0%
decisions to send their their children
to

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
um to you know private daycare and um
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
and and you know my understanding is
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there's there's um certain
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for licensed
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
daycare uh providers as well but and I'm
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
not at all equating
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
um uh homeschool education program to uh
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
to a licensed daycare I'm not equating
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
that at all but my question actually is
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
to representative Tanner
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
um in section five
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
um which modifies the EFA law are you
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
suggesting that um that all Amazon
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
employees uh also submit to criminal
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
I mean no no so all right so so um
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
because and and
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
um the reason I'm asking that is I think
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
the the term education service provider
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
is used broadly within 194 F to
 
01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.289 --> 01:09:47.299 align:start position:0%
organizations ranging from
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
home education programs
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
all the way to you know Amazon and
 
01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
Walmart so
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
you know you know companies that are
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
providing materials right may I respond
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
to that sure so
 
01:10:07.689 --> 01:10:07.699 align:start position:0%
my um thought on that
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
subparagraph five was that um it would
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
it was obviously Amazon and Walmart are
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
supplying Goods rather than services and
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
that but Prager University or prenda or
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
Kai actually provide services where an
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
individual is involved or several
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
individuals are involved or software is
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
involved that may collect data on
 
01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.370 align:start position:0%
involved that may collect data on
students

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:36.380 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
where there would be a need for a safety
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
net of some sort so so follow-up yes so
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
in order to line up with with with what
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
you just said and I agree with with what
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
you just said would
 
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
you just said would
would

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:08.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know paragraph D in section five
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
have to have some
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
language to qualify which Education
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
Service what types of Education Service
 
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.729 align:start position:0%
Service what types of Education Service
Providers

01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
Providers
 
01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:21.530 align:start position:0%
Providers
um

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
would be would be would need to be
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
um uh criminal history records check
 
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
yes so we we need some yeah let's change
 
01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
further uh discussion
 
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.950 align:start position:0%
further uh discussion
um

01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
point out that I think in some
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
regards this
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
legislation goes beyond what is required
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
in public schools especially in terms of
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers I think the statutes say
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
designated volunteers
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um whereas this says basically all
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
volunteers so it goes beyond that we
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
require in public schools
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
and also in terms of Education Freedom
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
accounts the law currently says that
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
education service providers that accept
 
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.930 align:start position:0%
education service providers that accept
payments

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
um under the EFA statute are not an
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
agent of the state or federal government
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
so um I think we're
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
stepping into uh territory that we
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in terms of putting those
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them and we've had
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
testimony going back to the
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that background check uh study
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
commission that I mentioned earlier
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
chaired by Senator Ward where we had the
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
non-public schools Council
 
01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:54.020 align:start position:0%
um various
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
groups coming in and testifying that
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
they already do background checks
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
um it's uh pretty much required for them
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
in terms of insurance coverage that that
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:12.980 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
don't see a need for this legislation
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I I think
 
01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:24.020 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond where we need to be
 
01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:26.300 align:start position:0%
Russian cordiello
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
I do not see a need for this I also
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
think it may be harmful
 
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.290 align:start position:0%
think it may be harmful
um

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat related to a situation
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
that I deal with at the public library
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
where I work where
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
in order to just read a story it's story
 
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
time to be a guest reader you need to
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
have a criminal background check and I
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
think Echoes over the top and what it
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
does that I've seen and not just story
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
time there was also a man who was very
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
interested in helping children in a
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
chess club and I saw him just
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
leave the library I talked to him he
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was you know ridiculous that
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
he would have to have a criminal
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
background check to help kids with
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
playing chess when the parents are there
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
the the librarian's there and they still
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
so that's gone to an extreme at the
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
public libraries but I just that's my
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
background so I just wanted to bring it
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
up that I see how that discourages
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers from just coming to Story
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
Time and reading the story to the
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
children and so I see this could go in
 
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:27.860 align:start position:0%
that direction where it would discourage
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers there is also that issue of
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
of trust which representative Noble
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
brought up you know and again in my
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
current position I've met a lot of
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
homeschooling families in the town I
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
work in and um there is they know each
 
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
other they work together
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
um there's no need for this so um
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
where's the Tanner
 
01:14:59.689 --> 01:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
um I maybe it's because I've I've had
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks when I've had
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
employment outside of schools inside of
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
schools volunteering for different
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
things substitute teaching uh driving a
 
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.410 align:start position:0%
things substitute teaching uh driving a
bus

01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
bus
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
um that it's that I'm not insulted by
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
having a background check I I feel as
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
though if I have nothing to hide
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for me not to comply
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
with a background check and I also feel
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
that it is a safety net for kids I mean
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
kids that have just gone
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
into who knows where outer space we've
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
had numerous cases of kids that have
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
been abused that are found at home
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
I think that we should recognize that
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
this is this is not an intrusion on
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
people this is a safety net for kids
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
and kids are
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
being taught by imprenda for example an
 
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
18 year old who has a CPR
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
certification and
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
may or may not be part of the community
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
um and and as I said before there have
 
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
been part of people that I know that
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
have been part of the community that
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
would be the last people I would suspect
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
would be involved with child abuse and
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
yet were
 
01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.070 align:start position:0%
yet were
so

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:25.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
I just see this as as a compelling State
 
01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.169 align:start position:0%
I just see this as as a compelling State
interest

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
you seem to be going back though into uh
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
um uh abuse at home or it seems like
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
you're going back toward the
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
homeschooling situation
 
01:16:42.179 --> 01:16:50.110 align:start position:0%
homeschooling situation
no

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused there's a
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
reference here to rsa189 13-a underneath
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh number four here on on the bill
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at uh that statute right
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
now under 193 13A Roman One Part B a
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
non-public school may elect to require
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
criminal history records check
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
now where it says in law that they may
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
elect and through an alternative program
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
I can receive funds through my
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
savings account
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
and have my student go for a class let's
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
say at a private school for one period a
 
01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:38.060 align:start position:0%
day and they're receiving instruction
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
but that private school that
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
non-public's not required to have that
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
so where are we here you know
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
um are we now getting the business we're
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
going to require the non-public schools
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
to have criminal background checks when
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
they you know I'm just curious where
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
represent little
 
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.550 align:start position:0%
represent little
yeah

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
um thanks thanks very much I don't want
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
to get get out over my skis here but I
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
think the section of the law that you
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
just referenced uh representative Ladd
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
um was in existence long before 194 F uh
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
came into being so now we're seeing a
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
situation in New Hampshire where
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars are used to pay tuition
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
bills for students that go to private
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
schools and I think as representative
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
Tanner pointed out there's a um what's
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the term a compelling State interest
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
in assuring the safety
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
of these kids when when at those private
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
institutions and um and and the state
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
did not have a a a financial interest
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
in it until 194 F came into being that
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
all said
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
um uh everybody in New Hampshire is a
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter so so if another
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
um uh adult
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
you know at a non-public school uh
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
witnessed uh you know a tuition student
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
being abused I think they'd have an
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
obligation to any any
 
01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
obligation to any any
um

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
um any grown-up would have an obligation
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
to uh to report that but uh but yeah
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
this goes beyond it
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
um if um if um if you're a non-public
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
school taking State uh dollars uh now as
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
a result of 194 F than um then then you
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
would be subject to um to this new
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
um part in section five
 
01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:49.729 align:start position:0%
um part in section five
um

01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph d
 
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
I I would just
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
um uh say that uh I think courts uh up
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court have said that
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
um once those funds go into the account
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
of a private family they are no longer
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
public funds they are private funds at
 
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and we just had a discussion
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
um on the previous bill
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
um about uh you know if we get into
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
compelling interest of the state
 
01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:24.380 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be a compelling interest
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that uh those employees
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
in a school district did have a
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
employment background check so I think
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
there's even more of a compelling
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
interest if we want to raise that
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
argument with the uh the previous bill
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
then then this bill
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps of tenor
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
first of all I think the this the
 
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.169 align:start position:0%
first of all I think the this the
um

01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
referral to the 193 13 was also to to
 
01:20:59.810 --> 01:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
say the designated volunteer
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
um to indicate that's where the the
 
01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:04.460 align:start position:0%
language about designated volunteer is
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that um you know schools do
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh the the reason we said the last bill
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
was probably unnecessary was that even
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh from the state department we heard
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that it is a very very very very very
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
very rare circumstance where a person
 
01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:26.900 align:start position:0%
who is a teacher
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
credentialed it would be a mistake if it
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
was a credentialed teacher that didn't
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
have a background check
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
um so I think that that and as far as
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's public money or not I think
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
that uh similar to the original uh
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
discussion of this bill which ended in a
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
10-10 decision that were on a a 3-3 uh
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
course on this one as well at this point
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
in my yeah
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
um so I think that
 
01:22:10.739 --> 01:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
um so I think that
um

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
um we would just uh go to the full
 
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.669 align:start position:0%
um we would just uh go to the full
committee

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
when we vote in probably November
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
correct chairman Ladd
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
um with the outcome of this subcommittee
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
being split vote as well
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions on that one is
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
that as I said there are a couple of
 
01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:41.219 align:start position:0%
amendments I'd like to to do on this and
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
would would that be allowable at the
 
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee meeting
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
if you're you're coming back to do the
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
other bill as a subcommittee do it
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
during a subcommittee and air your
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
amendments there so then we go to the
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
final because we're going to be running
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
through 20 bills that day okay um so I I
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
advise you to do it as I think
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative was going to suggest okay
 
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
if you do want to uh offer an amendment
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
we will take that course then okay all
 
01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.810 align:start position:0%
we will take that course then okay all
right

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
both

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
267 to 628 will come back for a
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent meeting to be scheduled in
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
the near future
 
01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.510 align:start position:0%
the near future
um

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
yes right definitely yes yeah
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
um so we have another uh set of bills
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10 30 uh House Bill 623

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
take a five minute break until 10 30 and
 
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.440 --> 01:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%

um as we looked at a number of options
 
01:42:39.609 --> 01:42:39.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh assisting
 
01:42:42.729 --> 01:42:42.739 align:start position:0%
to engage
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
new teachers
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
in a way that would
 
01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:50.060 align:start position:0%
um allow them to
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
deal with their loan structure that they
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
have in schools as they graduate
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
and this was one of the things uh the
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
the Senate if the Senate subcommittee
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's this loan option was an
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
alternative that we looked at
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
for assisting teachers who are beginning
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
as we know that the uh
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
those who are between uh
 
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
within the five-year period there is a
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
high rate of teachers who basically
 
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
leave the profession
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
and so this was an attempt to try to
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
deal with the issue of teacher shortage
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
Rick is on the committee with me to try
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with a way to help
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
teachers as they start their career and
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to try to provide some
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness as incentives for them
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
to be there you'll note that there is an
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that was presented Amendment
 
01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:00.980 align:start position:0%
uh zero two two one H that talks about
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
how the uh what the loan forgiveness
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
would be it would be up to twelve
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh Over a four-year
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
five-year period uh and uh so we would
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
hope that this might be able to be
 
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:18.380 align:start position:0%
initiated this program has taken place
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
in several other states I do not have
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
the number of states that have done
 
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
something like this but it has been a
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
very popular program particularly for
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
students for areas where there are
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
problems in attracting teachers in rural
 
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
areas Etc and underperforming schools
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
and so that's why Mr chair this was
 
01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:49.340 align:start position:0%
presented in trying to uh to uh
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
represent the kinds of conversations
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
that we've had in the teacher shortage
 
01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.930 align:start position:0%
that we've had in the teacher shortage
committee

01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
I was wondering um
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
I uh brought the wrong folder and did
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
not have my original copy of this and
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
and the public hearing
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
um but could you go over the amendment
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
again because the amendment is not
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
listed on the uh Bill details uh screen
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
yeah the the amendment uh again tries to
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
focus it it
 
01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.350 align:start position:0%
focus it it
um

01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.169 --> 01:45:27.179 align:start position:0%
it illustrates uh the federal of the
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
loan uh several Federal long programs
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
and it targets a rural and
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
underperforming uh Educators at
 
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
underperforming school Educators as a
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
way to provide incentivizing
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and helping rural school districts
 
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
and underserved school districts and by
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
the way those are terms that are
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
familiar uh to the Department of
 
01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.629 align:start position:0%
familiar uh to the Department of
Education

01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
and they're the definition of what they
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
are in on lines 23 and uh 25 and then it
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
basically goes over on the next page
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
that talks about
 
01:46:09.609 --> 01:46:09.619 align:start position:0%
um how the teachers would basically be
 
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
reimbursed you know fifteen hundred
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars of first year twenty five
 
01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a second year Etc
 
01:46:18.649 --> 01:46:18.659 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's really what the
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is all about
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:23.159 --> 01:46:25.729 align:start position:0%
thank you
further

01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative cascad thank you uh
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
just some clarification questions on the
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
amendment it was
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
um written just a little different and I
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
I recognize the term my question is
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
because there's a federal teacher loan
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program a teacher's access
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
after they complete five years then
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're eligible to apply so would this
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
bill allow anyone within the first five
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
years to get loan repayment
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure all right so the there is
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
um a Public service loan forgiveness
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
there is a teacher loan forgiveness
 
01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
which again is has been quite popular
 
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
I've signed a lot of forms on that
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
teachers who have worked five years now
 
01:47:16.729 --> 01:47:16.739 align:start position:0%
become eligible
 
01:47:16.739 --> 01:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
become eligible
to

01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
um access that there's a Perkins loan
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
which is not as common and it's real
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
specific to math science El uh Ela
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
not Ela but ell
 
01:47:29.159 --> 01:47:30.050 align:start position:0%
not Ela but ell
um

01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
and then there's state-sponsored school
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness programs that are
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
called Direct Loans
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
um so I'm wondering what group of people
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
are we missing I'm sure there are in
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
terms of loan forgiveness
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
and does this amendment
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
sort of ask them to stay for X number of
 
01:47:56.050 --> 01:47:56.060 align:start position:0%
years yes yes yeah
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
the intent here is that once a teacher's
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
is in one of these defined schools that
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
they would stay there for that period of
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
time and I think the other intent is is
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
that as they uh become familiar with the
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
with the school district Etc that they
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
would even stay subsequent to that loan
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
forgiveness period come
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
so it's just a matter of defining
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
how early in their teaching career can
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
they access these right exactly loans
 
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.450 align:start position:0%
they access these right exactly loans
okay

01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.609 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:48:33.609 --> 01:48:33.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
and ask you a question representative
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
um uh sounds like you mentioned three or
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
four different programs and they are all
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
all except this state Direct Loans those
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
were Federal programs that you were
 
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah with those
 
01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
um programs were they uh was there a an
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
amount uh
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
a specified do you do you recall
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the amount of forgiveness
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
it was uh the Providence loan was for
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
our um teachers at who were teaching
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
full-time at a low-income School in
 
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
certain subjects
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
um and the loan is a certain percentage
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
um says if you're eligible for this
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
program up to 100 of the loan may be
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
canceled for teaching service in the
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
following Implement increments so you
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
have 15 percent gets canceled out in the
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
first first and second years of service
 
01:49:42.649 --> 01:49:42.659 align:start position:0%
20 in the third and fourth
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
and 30 percent in the fifth
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
and each amount canceled
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
um per year includes the interest that
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
was accrued since Perkins Perkins I
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
believe their guidelines are a little
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
bit more stringent than say the
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
the teacher alone forgiveness that's the
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
one I'm the most common with a lot of
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
teachers after five years
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
apply for that
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
that the teacher alone forgiveness is 17
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
500 up to seventeen thousand up to
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
Seventeen five hundred yes
 
01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.609 align:start position:0%
Seventeen five hundred yes
um

01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's five thousand it
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
fact who just asks representative Cass
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
Academy when you say what area do you
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
mean what subject area or what
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
geographic area or both uh it's a
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
combination of both uh in terms of the
 
01:50:40.679 --> 01:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
combination of both uh in terms of the
um

01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
Perkins loan must be a high low income
 
01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:47.149 align:start position:0%
Perkins loan must be a high low income
area

01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:50:47.159 --> 01:50:48.890 align:start position:0%
area
and

01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
and subject area but the teacher
 
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:54.659 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is primarily in special ed
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
and secondary math and science
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
those three categories qualifies them
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
for 17 500 in forgiveness
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
and then eligible teachers qualify for
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like that student that is
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
graduating from college and just
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
starting out is the pool of people
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
probably should be targeted to to Access
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
Loans immediately because I mean when
 
01:51:25.729 --> 01:51:25.739 align:start position:0%
they come out of college they get a new
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
job they're up on housing I mean they're
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the poor house
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that was the intent
 
01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.109 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that was the intent
fault

01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
fault
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
um so two questions can we get a cop get
 
01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:42.659 align:start position:0%
copies of the amendment I don't have it
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
either and I think it would be helpful
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and then related to that in the
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding it correctly
 
01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.129 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding it correctly
um

01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
it speaks about starting with students
 
01:51:58.609 --> 01:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
who have completed their sophomore year
 
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
in the University system so if that's
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
retained in the amendment is part of my
 
01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:13.149 align:start position:0%
retained in the amendment is part of my
question

01:52:13.149 --> 01:52:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's uh two zero zero two two
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.719 --> 01:53:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
awaiting copies of the amendment
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
um you have further questions of
 
01:53:07.739 --> 01:53:09.350 align:start position:0%
um you have further questions of
discussion

01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.209 align:start position:0%
discussion
um

01:53:11.209 --> 01:53:11.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm I've got a question sure
 
01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.490 align:start position:0%
well I'm I've got a question sure
because

01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
um it says oh you'll see this on on the
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
second page it refers to this is the
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
amendment you're referencing yeah okay
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
it refers to a commission
 
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
and uh and for the life of me I'm not
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative Cascade
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
um just to add in part four of the
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
amendment it kind of identifies the
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of eligible education
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
expenses may be provided on behalf of a
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
rule and underperforming school educator
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
and one of the criteria is they have to
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
have signed a contract with such a
 
01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.669 align:start position:0%
have signed a contract with such a
school

01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a new grad again
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
you don't want to sign a contract for
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
at the onset because then if they're not
 
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
a good teacher you can't not renew them
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
no I think I I think that would be
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
subject to any
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
performance appraisal of an interview I
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
mean so they probably should say that
 
01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:31.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere that it says
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
has assigned contract
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
if performance evaluation is
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
satisfactory to the district
 
01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:44.300 align:start position:0%
than that candidate
 
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:46.010 align:start position:0%
than that candidate
should

01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
but at any time could be let go within
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
that five years
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
either with the risky part
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay with the amendment or the original
 
01:55:01.679 --> 01:55:03.129 align:start position:0%
okay with the amendment or the original
bill

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:03.139 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:07.209 --> 01:55:07.219 align:start position:0%
they have an effective date on them
 
01:55:07.219 --> 01:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
they have an effective date on them
so

01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
teachers who Maybe started out the year
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
before would not be eligible is that the
 
01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:18.260 align:start position:0%
way the
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
the language is say that again if
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
um if the loan forgiveness of program is
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
effective let's say July 1 uh 2024 right
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
someone who was hired in 2023 would not
 
01:55:36.649 --> 01:55:36.659 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the loan forgiveness
 
01:55:36.659 --> 01:55:38.330 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the loan forgiveness
program

01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
good question yeah don't know
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
also I think too
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
a new employee is an at-will employee
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
until the fifth year
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes so I mean that would
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
fall under the same kind of Aegis
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:56:06.410 --> 01:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay because they're not that
 
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
will but still subject to a one-year
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
teacher's contract but they they're not
 
01:56:14.209 --> 01:56:14.219 align:start position:0%
afforded to process right exactly that's
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
well it's more it's it's right right
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
yeah right there's no no reason you
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to explain it in five years
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
but after that there has to be
 
01:56:26.290 --> 01:56:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah so you're saying the at
 
01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
Will is at any time
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm using no it's any time up to five
 
01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
years I'm using the app will the term
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
out will maybe it's the wrong term
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
that's more of a commercial okay um you
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
know it's non-public uh you know type of
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
thing where you can where you can you
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
can hire and release a work of a person
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
any at any time for any reason
 
01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the collective bargaining you know
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
all teachers are subject to the
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining in the contract
 
01:57:04.199 --> 01:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining in the contract
yeah

01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:12.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:15.290 --> 01:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
how does the um
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
forgiveness work
 
01:57:17.219 --> 01:57:20.629 align:start position:0%
forgiveness work
um

01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
um who covers the amount that is Pace
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.649 --> 01:57:48.659 align:start position:0%
well I think the intent here was that it
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be a state program State program
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
right it looks like uh
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
on the last section
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
01:58:21.179 --> 01:58:22.609 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
um

01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
as I think you indicated has a an
 
01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:27.890 align:start position:0%
as I think you indicated has a an
appropriation

01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
um for fiscal years 24-25 with a million
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
and two million dollars
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:42.659 align:start position:0%
and calls on
 
01:58:47.410 --> 01:58:47.420 align:start position:0%
um a warrant to be uh issue to
 
01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
arrive at that money from the from the
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
treasury right
 
01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
what was that amount again please
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
um it was 1 million in 2020 a year
 
01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
ending 2020 June 30th 2024 and 2 million
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
all right so if represent you go ahead
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
I was just reflecting on your inquiry
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli about I think
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
potentially saying who's paying
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
correctly if I'm not paraphrasing
 
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
accurately yes uh line 35 and going
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
forward from there in the amendment
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
speaks about the department reimbursing
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
public schools with the public schools
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
submitting to the department
 
01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:47.990 align:start position:0%
submitting to the department
verification

01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
verification
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
of eligible loan repayments and then the
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
department reimbursing the public school
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
for that cost
 
01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:56.629 align:start position:0%
for that cost
so

01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
assume the department is the Department
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
and if I may sure
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
so relative to your question before we
 
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
I mean I would appreciate some
 
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
discussion about the question of making
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
it retroactive to at least some degree I
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
realized that
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
changes the costs
 
02:00:25.679 --> 02:00:26.810 align:start position:0%
changes the costs
um

02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
what the need is already there and so if
 
02:00:30.119 --> 02:00:31.550 align:start position:0%
what the need is already there and so if
this

02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
and right now the amendment says
 
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st 2023 which is
 
02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
obviously not going to be the effective
 
02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
date well
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know that would be retroactive
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
so I guess this is a question how would
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
retroactive work how would it be the
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
question I don't know that
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
in all the Appropriations are for
 
02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:00.410 align:start position:0%
in all the Appropriations are for
um

02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
if I could ask representative Ladd in
 
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
terms of the teacher shortage
 
02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:16.910 align:start position:0%
terms of the teacher shortage
um

02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
committee how does this fit in with
 
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
what's been going on with that committee
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
I I think this parallels a lot of the
 
02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
discussion which we've had on the
 
02:01:31.129 --> 02:01:31.139 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee
 
02:01:31.139 --> 02:01:34.010 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee
um

02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes I look at the amendment here
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's wide enough in
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
scope but we're talking about rule
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
locations or underperforming areas based
 
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
upon the nape I don't know if that's the
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
proper tool to use
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh but when we're talking about a area
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
like a Manchester which is in dire need
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
of of teachers in certain shortage areas
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so you know I I the whole concept
 
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
here I agree that we've got to do
 
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
something to keeping and attracting
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
folks into certain areas in the state
 
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
where we have shortages but I think we
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
have a shortages of special ed teachers
 
02:02:15.659 --> 02:02:17.570 align:start position:0%
have a shortages of special ed teachers
everywhere

02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
not just you know in uh the Manchester
 
02:02:22.729 --> 02:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
but you might have them out in the
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
wealthier property I hate these rich but
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
a well-endowed communities
 
02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:30.890 align:start position:0%
a well-endowed communities
so

02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
um and of course we do know that the
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
shortages primarily they're in in
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
communities which can get the good
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
teachers from surrounding areas come in
 
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
because we pay more based on our
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated agreement
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I I concur with much what I see I'm
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this being trying to grab a
 
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
hold of it now for the you know probably
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
the second time or third time I'm just
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
trying to get a good fix on it
 
02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:54.169 align:start position:0%
trying to get a good fix on it
um

02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
I I you know 20 enrolled students per
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
square mile
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a a general term we use
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
in a lot of language like this is New
 
02:03:06.669 --> 02:03:06.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire same as you know some others
 
02:03:09.649 --> 02:03:09.659 align:start position:0%
uh Estates and and using the neighbor
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
grades four eight eleven you know we
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
also give our Statewide assessment here
 
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
we also have graduation rates too that
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
which we could use as a determiner
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
um but I I I support the scope of this I
 
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
I in the intent of the bill
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
um it needs and you just need a little
 
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
more time you need some work yeah but I
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
I think we can't delay too long on it
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
but uh I I think it needs work and I
 
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
think that would be the physician of
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
those that are on the teacher shortage
 
02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
committee as well yeah
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:48.550 align:start position:0%
committee as well yeah
[Music]

02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
we do have uh teacher shortage committee
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
coming up next Monday I think
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I I'm not sure they've even seen
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
this we've talked about the conics
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
admire that we bring this to that and
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
get it on the docket for discussion at
 
02:04:08.209 --> 02:04:08.219 align:start position:0%
that meeting so we can go through it and
 
02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
you can have another set of eyes looking
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
at including some Senate eyes yeah good
 
02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
I think we'll do that I'll do that yeah
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think for retention retention I
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
think it would be a carrot for teachers
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
graduating from college
 
02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
if the salary is not as high in one
 
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
District as another but yet there's an
 
02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
for a loan repayment
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a good thing I
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
think it's that pool of people that are
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
struggling to stay in the field because
 
02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it
 
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:41.870 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it
um

02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
and also language should be in there so
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
that it is up to The District in terms
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
of pending evaluation process you know
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
on this whole issue of teacher shortage
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this we've looked I'm
 
02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
introducing a a mentoring bill that's
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
also uh for this session uh I also heard
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I was talking with representative
 
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
um I was talking with representative
woodcock

02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
and he was saying that he uh while he
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
was in Texas with his uh new grandbaby
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
he read a story of Houston schools the
 
02:05:20.209 --> 02:05:20.219 align:start position:0%
school district is actually building
 
02:05:20.219 --> 02:05:22.250 align:start position:0%
school district is actually building
housing

02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
for teachers a huge complex that they're
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
they're now developing to attract
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
teachers to come
 
02:05:34.010 --> 02:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
to teach there and have you know reduce
 
02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
housing costs for them so there are a
 
02:05:38.089 --> 02:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
number of different things that are we
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
haven't we haven't gotten to the housing
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
issue here although there is a child
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
care is another issue although there is
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh we we did discover that in uh in
 
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.669 align:start position:0%
uh we we did discover that in uh in
Littleton

02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
Littleton
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh that there is uh housing some you may
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
be familiar with that not very but I'm
 
02:05:58.010 --> 02:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
aware there was a housing issue there
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
where they were providing housing for
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
for teachers and interns actually yes uh
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
to try to attract teachers because of
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
the rural nature of the particular
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
School District so this is just one of a
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
variety of different Alternatives that
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
we're looking at Glenn can I uh
 
02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
interject for a second I'm also
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
02:06:22.729 --> 02:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I I believe the
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
we talked about University system in the
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
last line of the we also talked about
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're seeing fewer graduates coming out
 
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education at UNH
 
02:06:38.209 --> 02:06:38.219 align:start position:0%
than we have in previous years not just
 
02:06:40.729 --> 02:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
because of demographic either
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
and and so we're picking up teachers
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
coming out of snoo we're teaching out a
 
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
teacher's coming out and we want to
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
retain these residents in our state
 
02:06:55.490 --> 02:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
teaching our state and I'm not quite so
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
concerned whether they're a graduate of
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
King Plymouth or UNH
 
02:07:01.850 --> 02:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
um I think we ought to be trying to
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
attract and keep our New Hampshire
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
students that are deciding B teachers in
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
our state regardless of where that
 
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
degree is from
 
02:07:14.209 --> 02:07:14.219 align:start position:0%
we're employing more teachers in the
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
state now of course that are from out of
 
02:07:17.689 --> 02:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
state institutions
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
than we are from our own in-state to as
 
02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:22.850 align:start position:0%
than we are from our own in-state to as
institutions

02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
to be really effective we need to
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know think of where is the well this
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
money is coming from but also
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
um trying to get more students
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
participating in this program
 
02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:37.910 align:start position:0%
participating in this program
yes

02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
um I Echo representative Ladd in regards
 
02:07:45.530 --> 02:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
to looking at this more broadly than the
 
02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
University Systems new Colby Sawyer
 
02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
College any number of Institutions that
 
02:07:50.699 --> 02:07:51.530 align:start position:0%
College any number of Institutions that
are

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
educating teachers a lot of them people
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
who are residents of New Hampshire who
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
grew up here and then they leave
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
to teach elsewhere this could make it
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
more attractive for people to stay
 
02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:06.380 align:start position:0%
I'm also wondering if the
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
consideration of Rural and
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
underperforming what representative Ladd
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
was noting that you might be in a
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
non-rural area but
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
be an underperforming school and for
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
example need special educators
 
02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
but if instead of it saying Rural and
 
02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:26.060 align:start position:0%
underperforming it was rural or
 
02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
underperforming and there's more than
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
one place where that distinction would
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
need to be made
 
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
so in other words a teacher would
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
qualify for loan forgiveness if they
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
were either in the rural District or the
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
underperforming district but it didn't
 
02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
have to be both
 
02:08:45.169 --> 02:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:49.370 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
um

02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
I just I have a question on part eight
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that I one number
 
02:09:02.689 --> 02:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
um it would be line number 35 36
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
um it mentions that it will be the
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
department will reimburse the public
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
school for qualifying loan repayments
 
02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the public school
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
district will be giving the money to the
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
teacher and the state will reimburse
 
02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.550 align:start position:0%
teacher and the state will reimburse
them

02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that means the public school has to
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
budget for that money ahead of time
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
and who knows what could happen I'm I'm
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about adding that dollar
 
02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:33.470 align:start position:0%
concerned about adding that dollar
amount

02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
to a school budget that's lean
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
and could we skip that step completely
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:45.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
and applies to the state I I just don't
 
02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good point I don't
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
like coming I know what we did with dual
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment the money was
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to the district but now we send it
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
directly to community college system and
 
02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
we take out that middle name yeah
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
it's good it's a good point get it off
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and it already has in Section 5
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
line 22
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the educators are applying to the
 
02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:15.649 align:start position:0%
that the educators are applying to the
Department

02:10:15.649 --> 02:10:15.659 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
for this program so why does the school
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
district even need to get involved
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
right other than verifying should be
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.589 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
one concern I have is uh the concept of
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness and need in terms of
 
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:42.290 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness and need in terms of
employment

02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you know we've been having a lot of
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
conversations in my County about the
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage and how it's impacting
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
our County nursing home and the costs of
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
bringing in agency staff
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
and and you know articles all the time
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
about the nursing shortage
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know in other Industries
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
I've read about in the state as well
 
02:11:11.649 --> 02:11:11.659 align:start position:0%
that are having shortages but we have
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
lowest unemployment rate uh you know in
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
in the country I think or one of the top
 
02:11:16.739 --> 02:11:18.770 align:start position:0%
in the country I think or one of the top
two

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
um so the whole subject of loan
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and you know where does it
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
start where does it end
 
02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Don along those lines I
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
had a question um drawing your attention
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
to page for a specifically lines nine
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
through eleven so towards the end
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the on the amending language and the
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment grants the governor the
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
ability to draw additional sums of money
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
from the treasury if necessary is that
 
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
power able to be checked by the
 
02:11:57.649 --> 02:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
executive Council or is that power just
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
granted to the governor
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it goes through the
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
well this has been this has been good I
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate this let let's Rick and I
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
take this to the group next Monday
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
and give further feedback on that and
 
02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
then I I made some notes Here I I have
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
got some questions that on this too so
 
02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:27.890 align:start position:0%
got some questions that on this too so
um

02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh let's we can set another meeting and
 
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'll bring back something
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yeah um I I
 
02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:38.530 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yeah um I I
um

02:12:38.530 --> 02:12:38.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
also feel that we got to get a better
 
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
grip on understanding of where the
 
02:12:47.089 --> 02:12:47.099 align:start position:0%
shortages may be
 
02:12:47.099 --> 02:12:48.709 align:start position:0%
shortages may be
um

02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
as you recall several years ago about a
 
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
year ago we were asking for information
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
from the districts in terms of what are
 
02:12:59.330 --> 02:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
the superintendent over there we only
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
got 20 percent return we got a high
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
according to Mr Appleby right now I'll
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
up around 56 percent return so we're not
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
getting a good return from the field on
 
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
this information we need to make these
 
02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:16.189 align:start position:0%
this information we need to make these
decisions

02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
um we do know though the teacher
 
02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
shortage committee does know that there
 
02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
were shortages before covet
 
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
in certain subject areas
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
unlike the maybe in nursing as well but
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you right now according to
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
what I heard the higher education
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
meeting the other day with the trustees
 
02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
is we're putting out enough nurses now
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
that we're in a little bit of an uptick
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
on it now it may not keep going like
 
02:13:43.679 --> 02:13:44.390 align:start position:0%
on it now it may not keep going like
that

02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:46.370 --> 02:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
but compared to where we are with the
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
teachers there is still this downtick
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to see some real good
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
information coming in from the districts
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
as to where these specific shortages are
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
in these teaching areas we knew
 
02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
beforehand we had special ed background
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
issues we knew we had issues dealing
 
02:14:07.370 --> 02:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
with the Sciences we couldn't find them
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
especially in the rural areas so
 
02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'd encourage doe to try and get a
 
02:14:14.450 --> 02:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
better return on the survey this year
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
and I know that I spoke with even Steve
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
just this weekend and they're trying to
 
02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
work on that but we need to get that
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
information too for this teacher
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
shortage meeting which we're going to
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
have here in a week
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm wondering about uh let's
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
say on page two lines 27 to 29 what
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
about the teacher who's a great teacher
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
but has been faced with reduction in
 
02:14:43.129 --> 02:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
force so they've been riffed in their
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean that now they're not
 
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
going to be eligible if they go get a
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
job at a different school or a different
 
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
School District even though they were
 
02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
they went to a rural or underperforming
 
02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.830 align:start position:0%
they went to a rural or underperforming
school

02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
but if they were ripped they had and
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
they're a great teacher
 
02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
but you know what our numbers are down
 
02:15:02.209 --> 02:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
and we don't need that science teacher
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
anymore so now they've got to go
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
yes the other piece to think about when
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
you do go to committee I'm finding in
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
the ads north of the notch is
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
Administrative positions I mean there
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
are assistant
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
administrative positions
 
02:15:26.930 --> 02:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
um is I mean just look at the
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
superintendent level there's a ton of
 
02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
interims but I'm finding that building
 
02:15:33.229 --> 02:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
level administrators were not
 
02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:35.099 align:start position:0%
traditionally on that critical shortage
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
list that came out but now you're seeing
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
that come up so if you've got somebody
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
who was in the field went back to school
 
02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
and got certified they may have loans I
 
02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's a pool of people
 
02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
you wanna
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
add to this or not I mean I'm open to
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
either way but when you're talking about
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
critical shortage it's hard to get good
 
02:15:57.890 --> 02:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
administrators to do the job
 
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
think this our study was primarily
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
before we had we yeah we had a number of
 
02:16:06.010 --> 02:16:06.020 align:start position:0%
people who came to us nurses being one
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
Paris being another uh and I think the
 
02:16:11.689 --> 02:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
committee said no no we we need to focus
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
just on teachers and that's that really
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
is the scope of it yeah
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
but according to the law a principal is
 
02:16:24.890 --> 02:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
or the principal as a teacher
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
principal is a teacher
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.770 --> 02:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
so I I think uh the consensus is that we
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
will have a follow-up meeting
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
um at some point soon after the teacher
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
shortage uh committee and get get their
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh input and possibly some many language
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
after that I appreciate the feedback
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Damon thank you
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
just one more could we ask the doe to
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
provide us some
 
02:17:04.559 --> 02:17:05.929 align:start position:0%
provide us some
um

02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
maybe list of communities that
 
02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
are rural by the definition here of what
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
is it less than 20 enrolled students per
 
02:17:17.810 --> 02:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
square mile
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and similarly which ones are
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
considered underperforming
 
02:17:22.559 --> 02:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
considered underperforming
yep

02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
um we can make that request to the
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
department yes see what we got yeah
 
02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:30.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
so I think uh that will end
 
02:17:38.530 --> 02:17:38.540 align:start position:0%
our time on uh House Bill 623
 
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
and we have uh ahead of us uh Senate
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 218. uh should we move right
 
02:17:51.849 --> 02:17:51.859 align:start position:0%
into that or get out when we can yeah
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 218 establishes an early
 
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:09.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
and can we have Brian Hawkins up here on
 
02:18:14.810 --> 02:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
that one please uh I know Brian has
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
talked with Steve Appleby and I've
 
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
talked with not Steve but not on this
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
topic and he may have some information
 
02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
on mentoring that he may want to hear
 
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:36.250 align:start position:0%
from the Department
sure

02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins from Nea New Hampshire uh
 
02:18:43.969 --> 02:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
so I did reach out to Mr Appleby at the
 
02:18:46.929 --> 02:18:46.939 align:start position:0%
department to see if he had any
 
02:18:49.610 --> 02:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
suggestions uh to address some of the
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
concerns that the committee made back in
 
02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099 align:start position:0%
the spring and so
 
02:18:56.099 --> 02:18:56.990 align:start position:0%
the spring and so
um

02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:59.690 --> 02:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I know he couldn't be here today so
 
02:19:03.169 --> 02:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
uh because it it did sound like that he
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
may have some uh suggested language
 
02:19:08.929 --> 02:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
um we did work with Senator Fenton on
 
02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:19:13.250 --> 02:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and the idea being that those early
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
years that an educator is in a school
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
are as the shortage committee also heard
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
ours are the the most critical and to
 
02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that their um our plans in
 
02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
place at the school district level and
 
02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
then and then as well as uh you know
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
assistance for those school districts
 
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
that want to put in place a mentoring
 
02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:38.270 align:start position:0%
that want to put in place a mentoring
plan

02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
um and that was the idea behind the um
 
02:19:41.519 --> 02:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
um and that was the idea behind the um
the grants

02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
the grants
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer further questions
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:48.110 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer further questions
of

02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
um I know there was some question about
 
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh from the
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
routine discussion about who is an early
 
02:19:55.740 --> 02:19:57.170 align:start position:0%
routine discussion about who is an early
educator

02:19:57.170 --> 02:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
educator
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and and I guess I would point to the
 
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
the first three years that uh in um
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
Z1 line seven
 
02:20:09.889 --> 02:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
um the idea behind this is the people
 
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
who are
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
early in their career in education
 
02:20:20.050 --> 02:20:20.060 align:start position:0%
or it may be their first year in a new
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
or or in a first year in a new role
 
02:20:28.490 --> 02:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
because those are those are also very
 
02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:30.010 align:start position:0%
because those are those are also very
important

02:20:30.010 --> 02:20:30.020 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
times for an educator to have that
 
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the title two
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
funds would also cover a mentoring
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
program title two yes title two can be
 
02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
used for that okay
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm confused why this is even
 
02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
needed if that's covered because from
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
what I understand
 
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
that money is not being spent down
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
and we would have to spend this state
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
money before we could even get into the
 
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
title II funds but so my recollection
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
from the hearing
 
02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
um and again we there was uh no mention
 
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
of this in the Senate phase but my my
 
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
recollection from the hearing from the
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
Department was they were not sure as to
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
whether that was the case or not that
 
02:21:28.969 --> 02:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
was presented to the committee
 
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
um but that that was going to be
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
confirmed and so um I'm probably not in
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
a position to you know uh say whether
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's true or not I would I'd point to
 
02:21:40.969 --> 02:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
the folks who handled the title to
 
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
um but that was my recollection from
 
02:21:47.809 --> 02:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.819 --> 02:21:50.330 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
your recollection was that the uh State
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
Grant funds would have to be utilized
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
prior to title two kicking in
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh that from what I recall
 
02:22:06.889 --> 02:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
um uh there was the concern raised by
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
the department was that any
 
02:22:12.889 --> 02:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
um state or local funds had to be spent
 
02:22:12.899 --> 02:22:14.990 align:start position:0%
um state or local funds had to be spent
down

02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
um prior to accessing Title II funds but
 
02:22:22.570 --> 02:22:22.580 align:start position:0%
that that was going to be followed up on
 
02:22:24.730 --> 02:22:24.740 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the clarification
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
um Yes again I think I raised the
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
question earlier about the term early
 
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:34.910 align:start position:0%
question earlier about the term early
Educators

02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
Educators
 
02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
um my perception would be as a
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
certification of newborn to grade 3 or
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
preschool or Early Education and it
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's anyone that's new to
 
02:22:45.530 --> 02:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
the profession
 
02:22:47.929 --> 02:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
is that what it's intended for yeah I
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
think the thank you for the question the
 
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
intent being new to the sort of the uh
 
02:22:56.210 --> 02:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
in in the requirement for the for the
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
local master plan to include uh a
 
02:23:02.090 --> 02:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
professional development in the first
 
02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
part of the bill the intent was the
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
definition of early educator to meet
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
those one of those three uh uh
 
02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
descriptions in in lines seven eight and
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
nine yes not not not
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um that they're right in kindergarten or
 
02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
so this is intended to be a teacher
 
02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
02:23:41.530 --> 02:23:41.540 align:start position:0%
intended to to be uh I suppose a
 
02:23:43.969 --> 02:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
mentoring program
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
um but that it allows for the
 
02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:47.630 align:start position:0%
um but that it allows for the
um

02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
for the district to come up with that
 
02:23:54.050 --> 02:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
plan and submit that to the department
 
02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
and and I think the description in lines
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
five and six
 
02:23:58.560 --> 02:23:59.349 align:start position:0%
five and six
um

02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
I think speak to that about
 
02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:03.349 align:start position:0%
I think speak to that about
um

02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
articulate that that plan has to
 
02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
articulate what are the pro professional
 
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
learning goals and descriptions of the
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
development activities uh the district
 
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
will use to orient a new educator
 
02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:16.630 align:start position:0%
will use to orient a new educator
um

02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:19.730 --> 02:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
another follow-up yes
 
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
um that seems to me that it's a direct
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
conflict of Title II part A which is
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
preparing training recruiting high
 
02:24:28.250 --> 02:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
quality teachers and principals
 
02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:29.630 align:start position:0%
quality teachers and principals
um

02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
and you have to prove that your
 
02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
mentoring program has to
 
02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
meet your District's goals and
 
02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
objectives in your master plan
 
02:24:42.610 --> 02:24:42.620 align:start position:0%
and I just worry about those federal
 
02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
funds as opposed to the state fund
 
02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
because the federal funds are allocation
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
so people they need to submit
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
sort of an application or justification
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to use it but they don't
 
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
actually need to apply for it it's not
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
competitive so I'm not sure what this
 
02:25:02.210 --> 02:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
program would do that's over and above
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
that because you can have a very robust
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
mentor and induction program with those
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds when I looked up there are
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
very few every town gets an allocation
 
02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:14.690 align:start position:0%
very few every town gets an allocation
but

02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
um except for those I believe that don't
 
02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
actually have a school building in them
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
so I just I I'd want to know what does
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
this do that's different than that or is
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
it more money to do more and I don't
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
know why we need more if it already
 
02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:29.929 align:start position:0%
know why we need more if it already
exists

02:25:29.929 --> 02:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
do you know sure so I think the idea was
 
02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
we we had heard that there were uh
 
02:25:40.849 --> 02:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
districts out there that did that
 
02:25:40.859 --> 02:25:41.750 align:start position:0%
districts out there that did that
um

02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
that were not necessarily using their
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
Title II funds for this purpose and the
 
02:25:49.929 --> 02:25:49.939 align:start position:0%
idea would be as sort of a carrot
 
02:25:54.290 --> 02:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
that this would be uh something that
 
02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
they could supplement
 
02:25:59.330 --> 02:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
um a program and incentivize school
 
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
districts to to prioritize this as a um
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
as a program for their early Educators
 
02:26:09.410 --> 02:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I think at the end of the day so
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
much of it comes down to you know as you
 
02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
well know what are we going to spend
 
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's state funds or federal
 
02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:19.460 align:start position:0%
funds what are we spending them on and
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
resources dedicated to those early
 
02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:27.410 align:start position:0%
resources dedicated to those early
educators

02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
educators
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
can be one of those areas that that
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
falls falls through the cracks when
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
you're making difficult decisions about
 
02:26:37.370 --> 02:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
what to spend your dollars on including
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
who's your team
 
02:26:43.439 --> 02:26:44.750 align:start position:0%
who's your team
so

02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
if you would just clarify for me from
 
02:26:48.530 --> 02:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
what you just said am I correctly
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
districts might be spending their title
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
to money on other purposes
 
02:26:58.370 --> 02:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
and therefore would need what this bill
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
proposes to do to provide the new
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
educator mentoring other purposes or
 
02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:05.090 align:start position:0%
educator mentoring other purposes or
even

02:27:05.090 --> 02:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:27:07.849 --> 02:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
that there may be unspent Title II funds
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
out there that had had they been used
 
02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
potentially in conjunction with this
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
could have
 
02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
been put to use to help the folks that
 
02:27:21.889 --> 02:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
aren't professional when I received
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
Title II dollars we usually use those
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
Pro uh dollars for professional
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
development in the area for example like
 
02:27:38.270 --> 02:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
the reading information that represent
 
02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
cordelli has been bringing forward K
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
through three or we did it for
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
mathematics so we did it for some other
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
area of our curriculum and instruction
 
02:27:49.929 --> 02:27:49.939 align:start position:0%
I see this bill
 
02:27:53.210 --> 02:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
here primarily here I think represent
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
Damon you just said new teacher
 
02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:57.830 align:start position:0%
Damon you just said new teacher
mentoring

02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
mentoring
 
02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
and so orienting that teacher to what we
 
02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
do within the system that they're now
 
02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
going to work within so we may have a
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
reading program there but we have to get
 
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
that teacher up to speed to what we're
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
doing there but professional development
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
I see more in regard to the total scope
 
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
of what the larger picture for that
 
02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
school or School District but these
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
people coming in that we have to orient
 
02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
and get on task of how we do things here
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
in town X that's where I see this
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
mentoring program being of help and
 
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Myler I believe you
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you had a bill coming
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
forward next session on mentoring yeah
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's being developed okay in development
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.750 --> 02:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
where do we
 
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
where do we go with this seems like
 
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
there are uh questions
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
um about uh
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
the use of the funds entitled to funds
 
02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:14.770 align:start position:0%
the use of the funds entitled to funds
um

02:29:14.770 --> 02:29:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have an accounting on that
 
02:29:19.969 --> 02:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
from the Department in terms of how the
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
professional to our Title II monies have
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
been used and what type of uh we did get
 
02:29:29.450 --> 02:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
a sheet on that as you may recall there
 
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
was a balance left over why is it not
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
being used
 
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
um is is a question we should have you
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
know before we start generating another
 
02:29:42.889 --> 02:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
pot of money if we have I have the funds
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
available let's use them
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
maybe for this area I don't know but we
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
do need to have an accounting from the
 
02:29:52.370 --> 02:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
Department on where we stand on that for
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.450 --> 02:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a good suggestion
 
02:29:59.460 --> 02:30:00.170 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a good suggestion
um

02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:04.849 --> 02:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
any further suggestions or should we uh
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
piggyback this with the future sub
 
02:30:10.969 --> 02:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
committee meeting also and get that
 
02:30:15.290 --> 02:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
information from the Department as well
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
I I think that's the Direction
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
um that I'm seeing by the nodding the
 
02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
head so
 
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
um we will schedule
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
um future subcommittee meeting for uh
 
02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
all four of the ones that we heard today
 
02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:33.230 align:start position:0%
all four of the ones that we heard today
and

02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:34.849 --> 02:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
um gather some information in the
 
02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
meantime both from
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
um the teacher shortage committee and
 
02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative lead are there any
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
definitions or policy statements which
 
02:30:46.969 --> 02:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
maybe the school board's Association has
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
on what is mentoring
 
02:30:54.410 --> 02:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
is there you know we use mentoring
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes here abroadly for so many
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
different things uh in professional
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
development is there a consensus amongst
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
the school districts as far as what they
 
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
I guess I mean if there's any school
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
board policy on it or not you know there
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
probably isn't
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I see I see you know coming from the
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
too uh looks like we can uh do some
 
02:31:37.250 --> 02:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
scheduling work and
 
02:31:39.050 --> 02:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
um some work and Gathering more
 
02:31:41.710 --> 02:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
information and uh looking at language
 
02:31:45.770 --> 02:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
and uh come back uh at some point in
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
October uh to uh finish this up
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
right so thank you very much for
 
02:31:55.969 --> 02:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
everyone in the meantime and uh Morgan
 
02:31:58.610 --> 02:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
did you have any questions before we uh
 
02:32:00.830 --> 02:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
break that uh
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.950 --> 02:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd brought up this
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
point but just what is the further
 
02:32:24.410 --> 02:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
distinction between the orientation and
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
kind of initiation into a new school
 
02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
district versus the personal development
 
02:32:29.929 --> 02:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
because I was kind of under the
 
02:32:31.370 --> 02:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
impression also that personal
 
02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
development was kind of going above and
 
02:32:35.929 --> 02:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
beyond and developing a specific set of
 
02:32:38.210 --> 02:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
skills that teachers are working towards
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
versus just getting acclimated to a new
 
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:42.410 align:start position:0%
versus just getting acclimated to a new
um

02:32:42.410 --> 02:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:50.090 --> 02:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.889 --> 02:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
I think personal development you know
 
02:32:54.410 --> 02:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
for example as a school principal for
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
all those years I had the responsibility
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
for going in and supervising and making
 
02:33:01.370 --> 02:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations whether a teacher would
 
02:33:04.250 --> 02:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know at that time be tenured not be
 
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
tenured and you do another number of
 
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:09.050 align:start position:0%
tenured and you do another number of
observations

02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
observations
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
and you may come out at the end of the
 
02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
office observation saying
 
02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
this teacher needs Improvement in this
 
02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:17.809 align:start position:0%
this teacher needs Improvement in this
area

02:33:17.809 --> 02:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
one of the times when I was back here in
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
the state working over in Romper in
 
02:33:25.610 --> 02:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
Maine and Robert I recommended that that
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
teacher go back to the University of
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
Maine at Farmington and take a course in
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
language arts and teaching up and that
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
person did that we helped you know
 
02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
because it was a recommendation made by
 
02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
the district we helped with that
 
02:33:47.330 --> 02:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so that was a individual personal uh
 
02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
need based upon observations done by the
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
administrator in the school
 
02:33:54.530 --> 02:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
I don't consider that necessarily
 
02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
mentoring that's that's just my job to
 
02:34:00.849 --> 02:34:00.859 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have somebody
 
02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
qualified at the level we want within
 
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
the classroom and you're giving every
 
02:34:07.849 --> 02:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
Best Shot you can where you see there is
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
room for improvement
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
but uh I saw professional development
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
where on a larger scope of what was good
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the whole as far as our moving
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.929 --> 02:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative Hall did you a little bit
 
02:34:29.330 --> 02:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
further on the mentoring I do think it's
 
02:34:31.309 --> 02:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
The Works of the school you've got a new
 
02:34:33.889 --> 02:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
person coming in your special teachers
 
02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
are using competency-based grading your
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
regular teachers are using ABCD and
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
you're trying to this person's coming in
 
02:34:42.490 --> 02:34:42.500 align:start position:0%
I need to know the rules of your school
 
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
whereas professional development I as a
 
02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd mentioned I see that
 
02:34:50.809 --> 02:34:50.819 align:start position:0%
as a whole school initiative we're going
 
02:34:50.819 --> 02:34:51.950 align:start position:0%
as a whole school initiative we're going
to

02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
okay I can't even think of an initiative
 
02:34:54.770 --> 02:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
right now we're going to take it on so
 
02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
the whole school has to be has to learn
 
02:34:59.450 --> 02:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
about this new program that they're
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to do or the new philosophy or
 
02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:03.170 align:start position:0%
going to do or the new philosophy or
whatever

02:35:03.170 --> 02:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
um but I think mentoring as an
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
individual I know in our school the
 
02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
mentoring program was for those new
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
teachers that came in and they would
 
02:35:12.050 --> 02:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
look for a seasoned person you had to be
 
02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
there let's say five years to be the
 
02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
mentor and to be paid sometimes you have
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
them and they're not paid sometimes you
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
have them and you are paid and then
 
02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes people get mad because they
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
are they Mentor but they don't get paid
 
02:35:28.370 --> 02:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
because it's just their nature to Mentor
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
their colleague so it's kind of a I do
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%

02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:53.929 align:start position:0%

02:36:26.090 --> 02:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
