00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
1479 I guess the number would be good uh
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
20240 92

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
20249 82h how about it excellent good
choice

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
um that's the motion
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
um is there a second second and by
 
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
sellers um we'll have discussion on uh
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be best if I
 
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be best if I
handled

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
handled
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
that um since my name is on the top of
 
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
it so um we had a couple of
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill as written um that
 
00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 align:start position:0%
I'm sure
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
everybody we've had this conversation
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
before um so this amendment solves two
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
or three of those problems that the
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill language had um
 
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
the original language uh required towns
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
to find a different funding source um
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
Beyond any taxpayer funds
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh and it was set up so that um
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
if you are going to have any of the
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
services you are going to have to pay
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
for those not only with State funds uh
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
not with State funds as the existing law
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
States but also without local locally
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
raised funds so uh that was one issue um
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment speaks to that um it also
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
created a penalty for um non- compliance
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
and I think the committee as a whole I
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
think I'm fair in saying that the
 
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole found that
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
problematic in that it seemed that it
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
would be unenforceable and if nothing
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
else would need a whole lot more
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
definition of how that would be
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
enforced um so this amendment does two
 
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
things um because we
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
recognized um the concern of a large
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
number of our constituents and I have as
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
maybe you have as well received um quite
 
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 align:start position:0%
a lot of mail from around the state um
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there are two things
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
that uh that we needed to do um one was
 
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
those um lobbying firms that offered
 
00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.029 align:start position:0%
those um lobbying firms that offered
multiple

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
Services um give the ability for a an
 
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:18.879 align:start position:0%
individual member town city um or
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
organization to be able to um
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
designate whether um they wanted
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
lobbying services or not um and leave it
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
up to them the town so that's one thing
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
that this amendment does is is create
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
the choice um for a town to decide
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
whether they want lobbying or not um to
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
do that it requires that the lobbying
 
00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:47.879 align:start position:0%
Services create a
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
um I'll call it an alart menu but um
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's only for purposes of uh the
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
discussion not for in the in the
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
paperwork itself but a um an individ
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
idiz Services um cost sheet um where
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
individual towns um would be able to um
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
pick which services that they wanted um
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
and in that uh if they chose not to have
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
lobbying services for their town they
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be Exempted from um 155 RSA 155
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
which is the requirement to segregate
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
State funds currently
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little disturbing to me just as a
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
side note here how
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
many how many people are not aware of um
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
155 and that requirement to segregate
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
State funds not just as a bookkeeping
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
entry but as physically SE separate
 
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.550 align:start position:0%
entry but as physically SE separate
those

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
funds it's a um little disturbing in
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
that uh it would seem to me that some of
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
these lobbying firms should be making
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
having their clients aware of that
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
requirement that's state law um so
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
that's uh the
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of the amendment um it
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
does as I said U eliminate
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
the the uh penalty phase of the original
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
language it also requires um the
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
lobbying firms to provide uh notice um
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
informing them of that requirement under
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
155 to segregate for State funds um they
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
are um required to get a a signature
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
from the member to um that they
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
understand and acknowledge that uh that
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
155 um exists and that would get filed
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
um with the regularly U scheduled
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist uh filings with the secretary
 
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.030 align:start position:0%
lobbyist uh filings with the secretary
of

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
state right now it's that's set up is
 
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.949 align:start position:0%
state right now it's that's set up is
quarterly

00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
um in the future I think there's
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
legislation going through now into the
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
Senate that would make that three times
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
a year um it may be something we want to
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
look at in the future of just making
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
that filing once a year um that that a
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
member would would just be uh um
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
agreeing or acknowledging that 155 and
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
the requirement to segregate funds um
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
exists only once a
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
year um but the big thing here
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's one other thing it also would
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
allow in the in this amendment for any
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
city or town that opts out of um
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying to be Exempted from U 155
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
requirements I think I mentioned that
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to make sure that that's
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
clear so really it's doing three major
 
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.870 align:start position:0%
clear so really it's doing three major
things

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
um but what the takeaway here is that um
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
cities and towns we've heard from our
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
constituents that cities and towns
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
um value the services that they're
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
getting from these organizations that
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
offer other services to lobbying um but
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
they've never had the opportunity to do
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
anything except buy all of it or buy
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
none of it and um and so this would give
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to um to decide
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
what fits best with their community and
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
fund that
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately um so I think I think with
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
that um you've got the whole Amendment
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
um in your hands so if it's something
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
that we want to entertain discussion I'm
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
happy to uh ask yep thank you very much
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank all of you for
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
working on this um I'm still trying to
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
grasp this so bear with me please um in
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh we see on lines 10
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
and 11 uh mere bookkeeping separation of
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
the public funds from other monies shall
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
not be sufficient so that takes care of
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
some of what you're talking about um how
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
how are we achieving this
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
um without bookkeeping I'm a little bit
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
lost please help me sure so what you
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
read um about that's existing law um the
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
the mere bookkeeping um and the segre
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
ation of funds is is existing law for
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
State funds right that would remain true
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
under this amendment as well um the only
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
difference would be is if an a city or
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
town chose not to have lobbying they
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from that requirement to
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
segregate the state funds because
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
they're not purchasing lobbying Services
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
yep representative McGee yes I'm clearly
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
coming late to the party but I did have
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
a question I noticed that the bill in
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
its original form is an FN and my
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
question is around the effects that it
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
will have on um the economics of the
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
situation um in terms of you know
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
lobbying groups that currently sort of
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
benefit towns and that sort of thing
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
like the municipal Association um does
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
this is this intended to have little or
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
no effect on their organization and
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
their finances or um have do we have any
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
kind of breakdown in terms of the fiscal
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
note as to what kind of an economic
 
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
impact it would have um with towns and
 
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.790 align:start position:0%
impact it would have um with towns and
the

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
state it's just I'm just I'm sorry if
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm taking us to someplace that the
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee's already been but I just was
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
really curious no I don't think the
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee has been in that direction um
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
it was it was my my understanding that
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note was um in the original
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
Bill primarily for the um the penalty
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
phase of of this not not for anything
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
else so I would assume um that when
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
we adopt the amendment the fiscal note
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
um would either go away Andor if the
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
speaker refers it to finance they will
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
um they will
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.829 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
comments representative Pearson thank
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just as a someone who has
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
a as a general rule likes local
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
control I like the idea that this pretty
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
much brings it down to the local level
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
and makes that decision making at a
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
local level so that this is something
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
that I can easily support uh especially
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
with that now being where the decision-
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
making comes from thank you
 
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.670 align:start position:0%
making comes from thank you
representative

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
comments I'm
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
assuming that um Democrats would like to
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
 us on it and and discuss given that
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
both of us have just received this in
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
the last um whatever half hour
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
um but it is
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I'd be looking for
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
um it be looking for any kind of um
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
typographical or or errors that you if
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
we could separate for about 10 minutes
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
if that's um so why don't why don't we
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
say we're back here at
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
10:30 is that
 
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.990 align:start position:0%
10:30 is that
enough

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
good all right we're in recess until
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:33:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
can

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
well the Democrats of caucus and there's
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
a consensus the Democrats we're back in
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
ex session thank you Mr chairman the
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
Democrats of caucus and there's a
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
consensus among the members as to what
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
position to take on this and we are
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
there further
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
questions yes so uh Mr chair I know that
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
in my emails you mentioned the the large
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
response and we had a a good um number
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
of people coming in and speaking to us
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill um uh and on the original
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
Bill the original Bill and then correct
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
um and then just getting this amendment
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
today though but for smaller towns it's
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
been hearing from them that this the
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
original bill could be very difficult
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
for them can you make also report for
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
the committee the blue the number on the
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
blue sheets from that um uh original
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
Bill too because I think that the
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
response is is is not for this bill but
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
do you have that number I think it was
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
very close I thought um on the well I
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
may be thinking of the online testimony
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
and that number I thought was with when
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
within one or two I don't remember do
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
you have that as the clerk I thought
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
that was something that as committee
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
members we can always have that data and
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
information uh we can we will we'll get
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
it for you okay should we pause and wait
 
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
for that or
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh well let me let me ask a different
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
question so if the number was um 24 54
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
either way does that do for us I think
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
for me I want to make sure I'm I'm
 
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
responsive to the public and the
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
constituents on this that's first and
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
foremost um so I want to and I want to
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
kind of be sure that I have a actual
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
number um versus each of our memories
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
but that is um I I just want to um make
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
clear the numbers that we will dig out
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
are for the original Bill not what we're
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
talking about here correct and there but
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
we're still moving through the process
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
of a bill we're working to potentially
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
make as you stated amendments can make a
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
bill better but in lack of having a lot
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
of time we're still voting on some of
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
those premises so I'm still none of
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
those premises this this repes all all
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
of them okay okay I appreciate that so I
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm trying to put forth is
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you're looking for
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't reflect what this amendment does
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the amendment because we haven't had
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
a chance okay so I appreciate that and
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
that um I think further solidifies
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
because we need to make sure that we
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity you know for that
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
public too yeah and being able we're
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
listening to the amendment we're
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
effectively replacing an entire bill
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
that the public then has not had a
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
chance to weigh in on in the same way
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
correct would you well which is which is
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
true which is what happens correct I
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
just but that I just there will be
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
another question I asked in in caucus
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
what are our numbers so that's and
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
usually it's something that you've
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
reported before so I thought it was
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
something simple and easy for you to
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
have um the only number that I can tell
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
you and I can pull it off um online the
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
on online testimony I didn't I'm quite
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
certain I never have even looked at the
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet quote unquote the one
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
that was from the hearing day um but not
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
something that you looked at okay yeah
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't U I don't want to spend
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
us to go much but again for me it's moot
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
at this point because it's that was
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
reflective of the original Bill not the
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
amended Bill
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
turn further discussion questions
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
oh rep sellers yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair if if I understand the
 
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.750 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair if if I understand the
amendment

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's really allowing more flexibility
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
and more local
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
control over lobbying or what can and
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
cannot be lob is that is that my
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
understanding um I think absolutely um
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this amendment that
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill there's nothing
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
in this amendment that
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
removes any option that a city or town
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
had previously or has currently I guess
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
is a better way of saying um all this
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
does is provide another option that's it
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
so nothing is being removed if that's
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
your question yeah yeah thank you and
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
and one followup sure and and and it it
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
also on the original Bill we had
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
penalties which those are gone correct
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
so we're not penalti anything right
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
you representative nting
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
Wong hello
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
um so I was reading through this and
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
currently if you don't like if your town
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to join something or you
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to join an organization that
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
provides lobbying and non-
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
lobbying um services at the moment
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
correct and correct and and now as well
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have to either yeah but this
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
would um nothing's changed with that
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
yeah um but in this bill
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
um we would be charging those
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
organizations to separate
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
between their lob to separate their
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying and non-
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
lobbying arms I
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
guess um would it can you ask it a
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
different way yeah I'm trying to figure
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
it okay so in line it says shall
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
establish an independent Services fee
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
schedule for non- lobbying lobbying
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
services so they would be separate in
 
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.870 align:start position:0%
services so they would be separate in
that

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
way and they would only have to pay for
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
the services they want the alicart menu
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've spoken up before um but already if
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
you don't like what they're doing you
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
just don't have to join correct correct
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have yeah just like now um if
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
if your Town's people uh decide not to
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
put a money in a line item for any
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
particular organization or
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
service you vote it out this is this is
 
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.430 align:start position:0%
service you vote it out this is this is
not

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
clearly this is different than what the
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
original bill was which
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
required um it was it was authoritarian
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
it was the state telling you telling the
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
town what you can spend your money on
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
and that was the problem that many of us
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
had um
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I don't feel it's our
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
job to tell a town what they can spend
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
their money on this is providing that
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
same ability for the well someone said
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
local control you decide what you want
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
to spend your money on not
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
us this is this is letting them if they
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
decide not to be members of the clerk's
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
Association have at it go ahead um
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
you're spending your own money the only
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we're retaining here is what
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
state money and it's exactly the same as
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
what's now what state money can be spent
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
on that's the only restriction and
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's what exists in current law we
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
haven't touched that at
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
all okay um so to me it feels like in
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
the name of local control we are then um
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
telling organizations how they can and
 
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
telling organizations how they can and
cannot

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
work um we are telling
 
00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
work um we are telling
organizations

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
how um how their members can access
 
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.630 align:start position:0%
how um how their members can access
their

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
services okay that makes more sense to
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
me which which which we do again
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
routinely um if if you want to have
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
access or or Lobby here here are the
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
rules for how we do that and and that
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
section is full of those kind of things
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is how you know you will provide
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly statements yeah same thing no
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
different so we are this amendment does
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
nothing to the existing
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
relationship if if an organization if a
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
town city or town or um if they
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
decide to operate exactly as they are
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
now nothing changes except for one thing
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
they now have to acknowledge that 155
 
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.030 align:start position:0%
they now have to acknowledge that 155
exists

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's the only
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
difference and then and then there is an
 
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
additional option for them there's there
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're not nothing in this amendment
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
takes anything away from how they
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
operate now if they want
 
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.630 align:start position:0%
operate now if they want
to

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative H uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah I view this um this amendment
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
very much as a compromise because for me
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
principle um I agreed with the
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but there was real
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
complications with the underlying bill
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
as you had said because what it's
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
essentially doing is forcing you know
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
the the prohibition of lobbying on the
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
state and what this does is it doesn't
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
change if no if a town doesn't want
 
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
anything to change and their select
 
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
board wants nothing to change nothing
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
changes the only associations that um
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
this would affect would be the ones that
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the allart services but M but
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
require lobbying to be a part of the
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
association and I've heard from several
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
people that um they don't know how how
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
like a town vote would go it's very
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
possible that no the vote would still
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
value those lobbying Services over
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
everything else um but but they value
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
the other services and don't want the
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
lobbying and they can't separate that
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
out currently it is all or nothing on
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
the association and all this does is Al
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
allows that uh separation if say you
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
wanted legal services but not lobbying
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
services to take out the lobbying
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
services and then you don't even have to
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
segregate your funds then if you're not
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
using so it's a um it's even easier to
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
comply and it's not exactly what I
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
wanted okay because um I don't like
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh funded lobbying uh it still
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
allows that um the what this does again
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
is it gives a choice to me choices this
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
can go um where literally no Town
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
votes if at all you know we we don't
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
know how many people in our town uh
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
would would want to separate that out
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
and if they do separate it out you still
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
get which we heard here in public
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
testimony that most of what um a lot of
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
these associations do first of all is
 
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
great work but they also say and we
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't know I I haven't seen the numbers
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
but they say 90% of what they do is
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
provide information is not lobbying it's
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
only about 10% of their efforts and if
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
that's the case then then even if um
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
many towns like chose to not Lobby it
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really even affect those
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
associations that much um if truly what
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing is 90% of the information
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
because you know and then also as as um
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
select boards and and moderators and
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
town clerks are already exempt from all
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
of the lobbying um uh under under this
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
law under current law um nothing
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
prevents them from pulling out that
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
lobbying saving that money and lobbying
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know sending emails directly to us
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
which we get sometimes anyway um so that
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
that's just my two cents I um I don't
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
love this um amendment I I viewed it as
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
a compromise to um try and try and give
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit of transparency on what
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
what is spent on lobbying with taxpayer
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
money and and the ability for individual
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
towns to vote just on the lobby portion
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
of of it and only on the associations
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
that mandate it on it's all or nothing
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem that I had with
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
it but um that's all I have Mr
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um further questions fur
 
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.950 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um further questions fur
the

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
discussion rep McGee thank you Mr
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just the only thought that
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
I had is that you know um we often times
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
deal with how things are done in New
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the different
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
perspectives you know in terms of good
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
and bad and lobbying in in the case of
 
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.990 align:start position:0%
and bad and lobbying in in the case of
lobbying

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh for taxpayers in the state you know I
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
think there's a real value to the fact
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
that there's expertise and
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
effort you know spent in order to bring
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
those views to uh the lawmakers here so
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we have uh the information about
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
how we're impacting people on the front
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
line so when we talk about taking
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money for lobbyists those
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are also working in order to
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that tax impacts are lower
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of that
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
particular uh type of lobbying so it's
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
not as though we're we're supplementing
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
through taxpayer money lobbyists that
 
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
are working on the on behalf of profit
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
making entities or others you know so I
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
I think we should not put it all in the
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
same bucket because lobbying is kind of
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
how we learn up here right people bring
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
us information that we might not
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise have about uh aspects of what
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're making decisions on as far as laws
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make that point um
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
because it lobbying isn't a bad word as
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
far as Government goes because we don't
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
have all the
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
is um how does anything that you've just
 
00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:57.390 align:start position:0%
is um how does anything that you've just
said

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
change if if this if the taxpayers agree
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
with with what you've just said which I
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
think the bulk of them
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
would what changes as a result of
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
this well I I look at it as a a chipping
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
away of um how we are currently doing
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
local control um I know just from
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
sitting in school meetings um how there
 
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
are some folks who don't want to pay for
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
any public services and there's a
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
benefit to having a public service
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's spread over all of towns um and
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
so I think the economics for some of the
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that actually um Advocate on
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um I think that the economics
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
for those organizations could very well
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
change and I think that's where the
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
concern is um because if it's if we're
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
making more hurdles for those folks in
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
terms of uh compliance and um
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping and and you know compliance
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing uh there may be more
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
expenses for them uh to spread out over
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
whatever towns are paying right so then
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
as people fall off it's just sort of a
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
weakening of the system that we have so
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's how I see it anyway y
 
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.109 align:start position:0%
that's how I see it anyway y
representative

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
Shen yeah that just raised a question in
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
my mind um the forms that lobbyists have
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
to fill out right now don't they have to
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
um separate like um declare how much
 
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.270 align:start position:0%
um separate like um declare how much
money

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
um yes they do um I think it's Roman
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
five it's uh 15 156 understatements
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 subsection D so that wouldn't
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
make any um more work for them this this
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
amendment right because they're already
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
doing it they are already doing it um
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
the only the only slight additional work
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
for them is um this new statement that
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
for just those clients that ask for
 
00:50:11.319 --> 00:50:12.430 align:start position:0%
for just those clients that ask for
lobbying

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
Services um they would be required to um
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
file a a signed form from the client
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
that says they understand the
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions on state funds being used
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
for purchasing lobbying that's the only
 
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.230 align:start position:0%
for purchasing lobbying that's the only
additional

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
comments representative W thank you Mr
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um we've heard from the
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
municipal Association that it would be
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
too difficult to break out the lobbying
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
fees from the general amount that is
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
given to them for membership
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
because membership to the municipal
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
Association based on population for my
 
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.390 align:start position:0%
Association based on population for my
community

00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
so of course it's not up for us to
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
figure out how they're going to separate
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
that but I am curious how would they how
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
could they
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
separate what they use now for a common
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
formula for all communities in the state
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
how do they separate the lobbying part
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
from that do I have no
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
idea um as a financial adviser I will
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
tell you what I would do what I would
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
start with um as repan just mentioned um
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
these forms are filed uh Cally now that
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
indicate what portion of of their bill
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
to each Community is is broken down by
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
what category and how much it's it's
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
already there for uh for lobbying for
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
instance how much um is designated for
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
that they have to do that now so if it
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
were me I would go back and looked at
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
how I have um filled those forms out for
 
00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:02.990 align:start position:0%
how I have um filled those forms out for
the

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
last however long I don't know Hampton
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
has been a client and said Gee here's
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
how I filled it out before here's here's
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
what I would start with what I'm going
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
to charge um next year and and I'll
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
Grant you um I forget who brought it up
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
but but someone did point out that in
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
testimony that they have no idea um what
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
bills representative Mass Millo is is
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
filing so they don't know how much time
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be spending here on a
 
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.109 align:start position:0%
they're going to be spending here on a
given

00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
year but goodness um you if you've had a
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
client for 20 years um and you can see
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
you've been filling out those forms for
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
all those
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
years I got to believe there may be
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
anomaly years in there but I would think
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
you could come pretty darn close to what
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
that cost is um that's how I would do it
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
um whether that's it's not up to me to
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
to decide how how they would determine
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
that fee um we're we're careful not to
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
create that that number um but it's
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly up to the the taxpayer to or
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
the selectman or who's ever purchasing
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
that service to ask how did they arrange
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
at that fee for that Community I would
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
think so it's not an All or Nothing
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
thing when you buy in for membership you
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
can buy in for specific sort of like
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
when you buy car insurance you know
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly you want to up the amount that
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
you would pay somebody if you killed
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
them or something like that um I don't
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
know why you went there but but you can
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
op in you can opt for a higher that's
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
really not how I buy car insurance but
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
when you buy car insurance you can opt
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
in for certain provisions and so that's
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
what you're saying here okay and what
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
you like may be different than what
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
McGee likes you know that's that's the
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
point I would keep coming back to the
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
idea that if you're happy with how if
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're happy with how it works
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
now that's still an option for you um
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not dictating we're not
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
taking anything away we are only giving
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
another option for the community to um
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
decide and and again
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
what with all do respect to R McGee she
 
00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:29.559 align:start position:0%
may not be representative of everyone in
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
her community or she may be and they and
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
and whoever wins the day would be able
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
to follow their path whatever they want
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
to do um this doesn't this is enabling
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
comments rep sers thank you Mr chair so
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just making sure I have it 100%
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
right myself this bill
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
is technically all in the lobbyist it's
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
all about the lobbyist itself first of
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
all the second part of that is the bill
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
allows the
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
towns to pay for only the services that
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
they want at this point so they can
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
break it out so I mean if I had a uh a
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy center let's say for the
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
school that came in that was a lobbyist
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
right they're a
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyist well maybe the Pregnancy Center
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
offers pro-life stuff which I'm against
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
or I'm for one or the other but the
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
point is is they they're also offering
 
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:42.039 align:start position:0%
Services counseling and and meds and and
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
other things which I want so you're
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
saying at that point the school can
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
actually pay for those part of the
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
services but not pay for the lobbyist is
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
that what I'm understanding uh I believe
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct and I think if
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
I heard one thing
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
from um the communities that or the
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
officials from the communities as I read
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
each one of the online
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
testimonies um they did point out many
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
they that they currently receive as in
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
their membership that they want and this
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
is why they pay for the membership of
 
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.029 align:start position:0%
is why they pay for the membership of
that

00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:27.039 --> 00:56:29.190 align:start position:0%
that
organization

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
um but again it's an all or nothing um
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
merely giving that local community the
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
option or those local officials that
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
option of deciding whether um All or
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
Nothing fits them best or um some piece
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
of that fits them best that's all it
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
to the original Bill we have a motion
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
for the original
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
for the original
bill

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative cost I don't I don't have
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
it on me but doesn't that um mean that
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
it's open to further amendments as well
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I do have an amendment but I don't
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
me the original bill has a penalty I do
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment that just pulls the
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
penalty out I don't know if it's worth
 
01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
doing I mean it we're we're pro reading
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
tea leaves we'll probably end up 8 on
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
everything anyway so we should just you
 
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.750 align:start position:0%
everything anyway so we should just you
know

01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
um Mr yes and in previous get me out of
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
this yeah I in previous presedent you
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
haven't uh typically taken an amendment
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
there was a previous bill that had a
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
last and and just as a reminder you
 
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
didn't that is that is My Prerogative um
 
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
to take an amendment or not um I guess
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
what I
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
will say or I will toss out to the
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee is um rather
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
than my understanding is this amendment
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
drafted no it it's been drafted yeah
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
it's been drafted I just don't I didn't
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
think you don't physically have it you
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
have the number I don't physically have
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
it I probably can find the number but
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if it's not going to well
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's any the outcome of this then I
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't really want to go through those
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
motions does that make um
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
would that make any difference if the
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
penalty phase which is what it's being
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
purported the the amendment would do if
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
the penalty phased because otherwise I'm
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
not going to waste additional time and
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
or take time away from here um that we
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
wait to have it copied and drafted if
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to do anything then I
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
would ignore that
 
01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.510 align:start position:0%
would ignore that
Amendment

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
so is there um I can do this
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
by by um raising of hands um if that
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
makes any difference um and why don't I
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
why don't I do it in that form so if if
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment was put forth that um
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated the penalty phase of the
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
original bill um who would want that
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
that amendment to have in front of
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
them who who would want that Amendment
 
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.149 align:start position:0%
them who who would want that Amendment
here

01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
yeah no probably not the same way um if
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
if the amendment did um took away the
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
penalty phase um would you what's that
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
would you be inor would you be in favor
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
hand I I'm not Mr chair I'm sorry I just
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
think in the same way of hypotheticals
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's really I'm hesitant to raise my
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
hand in such a hypothetical it but all
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
it all it's purporting to do is remove
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
that part portion and is it worth us to
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
here I'm not seeing huge numbers of
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
hands so I'm going to ignore that
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that it exists um and so we're
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
back at this um unamended House Bill
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.310 align:start position:0%

the house so it's the appointments don't
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to be spread out between the
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office the
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the pr Senate um
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
Senate office um it also set up uh
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chairs and a legislative
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
um advisor um that's where uh help from
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
Rhett McDonald and Rhett wheeler came in
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
um because we um wrote the amendment
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
saying that um these co-chairs would be
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the youngest member of the majority
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
party and the youngest member of the
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
minority party or their design because
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know who the youngest
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
member will be next term um as well as
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh a more seasoned legislator um
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
advisor um we
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
um there was an issue um currently in
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
law uh with postsecondary students we
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's a current member that's actually
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
not following current law because she's
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
taking um postsecondary education
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
classes outside of the state uh online
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
so we we changed that that postsecondary
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
students have to be residents of New
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they're allowed to be
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking postsecondary education anywhere
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
um um we um added that appointments
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
shall be at a minimum from all 10
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire so we have a a
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
wide Regional
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
reach um we also um made an amendment
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
that makes youth terms uh we have a
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
one-year term and a 2ear term for youth
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
members half of the members will have
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
serve a one-year term and half will
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
serve a 2-year term and we did that so
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
we have fresh members coming in every
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
term it's not the same membership so um
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
it gives more opportunity for youths
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
around the state to participate and we
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
also did this um to have um some members
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
serve two years so we have some um
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
experience on the council so it's not
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
all new people coming in and kind of
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what what to do um
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
we also add a requirement um for the the
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
youth to read the oath of office and the
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the US
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and um I I really like this
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment because to be
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
honest coming into this I never really
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
had much knowledge about what this
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
Council does and I've really enjoyed
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
learning about it and um looking at
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
other councils around the the country
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
and um we added an amend added a part of
 
01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment to um put a legislative
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
youth advisory Council page on the
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
general court website dedicated to the
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
council um we um also came up with an
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
idea um to make a you know what makes a
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
good lak candidate document so when
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
we're promoting this Council um we'll
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
have a document that um um States you
 
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
know what makes a good candidate and
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
also um we um put in the amendment that
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education will promote
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
lak whenever
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
possible and um I think that we all feel
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
um that this is a a good Amendment and I
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
think that um that it's it's really
 
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
going to help the council and hopefully
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
um get the word out um to other youth
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here and and open
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
that up uh to more youth that would like
 
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.430 align:start position:0%
that up uh to more youth that would like
to

01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
participate thank you very much
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
um further discussion about the
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I just represent Richards
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to just
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
on lines three and four um which are
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
talking about like reappointment with
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
the one and twoe terms which I think is
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
a really cool idea and and support but
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
just in terms of
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
clarification and to meet the need of
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
having the folks be on for a while and
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
the the that um benefit to the council
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
um there is a line um
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to get clear about so
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
if someone serves a one-year term can
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
they then also be appointed for a
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
two-year term or can they
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
not um if there are openings they could
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
be re reappointed for another
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
year then so they would be reappointed
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
for one more year effectively serving a
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
total of two yes okay thanks I
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
think um I think that is done in the
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
initial um right now there are there are
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
some members that have been there longer
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
than others or um existing
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
members um I think and correct me if I'm
 
01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
wrong but it would I think what they're
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do is make sure that those
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
that have just served or are currently
 
01:29:00.119 --> 01:29:01.030 align:start position:0%
that have just served or are currently
um

01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
serving they would only be eligible for
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
a one-year term going forward so they
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
may have three years but in future years
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
it would uh all all councils yeah would
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
only be doing it's it's a way of I think
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
of offsetting so that you're constantly
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
having experience but new members at the
 
01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.990 align:start position:0%
having experience but new members at the
same

01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
final outcome of the language that the

Ethics Committee has requested us to put
 
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
forth um it still includes the special
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
interest which has been a bone of
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
contention in the past um and it does
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
include the um exception for uh when it
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
when or the defining line for when a um
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
a board legislator or a household member
 
01:40:00.189 --> 01:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
serves as an officer board member of
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
more than 1% of the outstanding
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
Securities of the corporation those were
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
the two items that were in Conflict
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
right to the end um and and um this is
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the ethics committee's
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
language um
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
questions and again this is what you had
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
the last meeting we just wanted to make
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
sure we had a couple of questions on
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
some of the language and whether the
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendment was actually drafted correctly
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
but um it was so um you've had you've
 
01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
had this since the last meeting this is
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
not anything that's different
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:56.470 align:start position:0%
not anything that's different
today

01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
any comments yeah representative W thank
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
you and I want to thank you thank
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative Shen for coming forward
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
with this amendment this is an issue
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
which the Ethics Committee has struggled
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
with for years and years and years and
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's been so difficult to come up with
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
something that's really clear and very
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
concise um this clearly tells us what a
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
special interest is and what we shall
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
and shall not do regarding that the same
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
with the financial interest this
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
clarifies a whole lot of issues that
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've had over the years with members
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
either thinking they should
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
recuse or not people recusing when they
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
haven't needed to people not recusing
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%

amended any further
 
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Pearson I have
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
a I have a question for representative
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
wall being on the Ethics
 
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
Committee if representative wall would
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
like to take your question that's fine
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
well because it's right because
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
everything passes through the chair well
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
the they I don't know why it would be
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
scary um but the the question that I
 
01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
have is is that if this does go through
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
the process and makes it into law with a
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
change of current condition is the
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
prepared for a workload that's going to
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
come from this initially because there's
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to be questions of clarity that I
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
think are going to need to come from
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
this I mean I know you necessarily
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
aren't speaking for the whole committee
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
but just a personal opinion I'm the the
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee from time to time does
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
have quite a workload but my opinion on
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
this is I think I I shouldn't speak for
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee as a whole but I
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
believe there's going to be some relief
 
01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.550 align:start position:0%
believe there's going to be some relief
thank

01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
you I I'm going to jump in a bit um I
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
think in some ways there will be um an
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
adjustment to this but I but I actually
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
think in the long run the Ethics
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
Committee this will relieve some of
 
01:44:55.950 --> 01:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
their work rather than add to it um I
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
think I think you're correct that there
 
01:44:57.679 --> 01:44:59.390 align:start position:0%
think I think you're correct that there
may

01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.669 align:start position:0%
may
be

01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
um new new phraseology new something new
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
guard rails new guard rails but I think
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
um I think they are they've been
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
chomping at the bit for having this um
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
and I think they understand um there's
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
some experience on the Ethics Committee
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling that they know what
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
into thank
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%

was passed to me thank you um I I think
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
it would always be helpful for us to
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
have some continuing education so that
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
the members are aware of changes that
 
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
are being made and I will make that
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
