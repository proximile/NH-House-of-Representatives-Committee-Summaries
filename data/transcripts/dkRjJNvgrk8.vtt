Bill 32 I want to keep saying house
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
bills but Senate bills uh 32 and uh I'd
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
like to recognize the prime sponsor
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you thank you
 
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman it's a pleasure to
 
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
be here for the record I'm Cindy
 
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald and I represent Senate
 
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
District 13 in Nashua and as chair of
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement advisory committee
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
commission I'm pleased to introduce
 
00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 32. this bill makes changes
 
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
to the operation of the opioid abatement
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
fund originally created in 2020 to
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
manage the distribution of settlement
 
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
funds for opioid litigation that will be
 
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
coming into the state for the next 18
 
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 align:start position:0%
years or so
 
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
in total we expect over that period New
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will receive more than 300
 
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars to mitigate the harms of
 
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
the opioid epidemic
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
so when we receive a check 15 percent of
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
that money goes out immediately to the
 
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
23 litigating
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and the balance goes into
 
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement fund
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
the opioid agreement advisory commission
 
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility and authority to
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
Grant these monies for a variety of
 
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
purposes laid out in statute
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
there are 22 members on the commission
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
representing subject matter experts HHS
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections Department of Justice the
 
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs and County and Municipal
 
00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.430 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs and County and Municipal
governments

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
we held our first round of Grant
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
applications last fall for 6.6 million
 
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.770 align:start position:0%
applications last fall for 6.6 million
dollars

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
the contracts for award grantees are
 
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 align:start position:0%
being finalized
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
to go before the executive Council
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
hopefully next month
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
since that first round more money has
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
come into the fund and we have just
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
agreed to issue an RFP that make five
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars for reimbursement of
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
medications for substance use disorder
 
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.810 align:start position:0%
medications for substance use disorder
available

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
this bill comes out of our experience in
 
00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 align:start position:0%
soliciting and awarding grants over the
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
past year and it does several things
 
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
first it establishes a requirement that
 
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
we give out grants at least once a year
 
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
when there is at least five million
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
dollars in the fund we will collaborate
 
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
with HHS on the number of times we will
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
do this in any given year and I should
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
also note that there's really likely to
 
00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
be at least five million dollars in the
 
00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
fund every year for the next 18 years
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
because of the way the settlements are
 
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.290 align:start position:0%
because of the way the settlements are
structured

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
but how however there is currently no
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
statutory language about how often we
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
give out grants or how much money
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
we would need to give out
 
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
second it clarifies and makes a couple
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
of additions to eligibility categories
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
for Grants these are recommendations
 
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 align:start position:0%
from the subject matter experts it also
 
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
expands the reimbursement for
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
medications for substance use disorder
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
treatments to recognize that naloxone is
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
not the only FDA approved product and
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
finally it updates language to reflect
 
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
best practices in the field and fixes a
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
couple of typos in this statute I'd be
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions but both the
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
doj is here and HHS is here and they
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
probably are better subject matter
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
experts than I am okay do you want
 
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 align:start position:0%
you're willing to answer questions yes I
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
am sure are there any questions from
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and you may choose
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
to defer this if you prefer I was just
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
wondering about the 15 that we're not
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
talking about and you said that goes to
 
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
litigating subdivisions and I just
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
wondered as a matter of curiosity who
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
those were
 
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
um Mr buffetti from the doj can reel
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
them off a memory but it's a range of I
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
know Nash was one
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
um I think Laconia maybe some counties
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
he knows thank you very much
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else any other
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
abatement commission that Senator
 
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald just mentioned uh so we we
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
come in support of this legislation
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
these are recommendations made by the
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
commission that would clarify and
 
00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.530 align:start position:0%
commission that would clarify and
streamline

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
streamline
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
um some of the processes the object
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
being trying to get this money out as
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can as it comes in so that
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
we can use it in our communities to help
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
Abate the opioid crisis I'm happy to
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%

settlements of the various settlements
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
the amounts that are coming in there was
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
a question from representative Weber
 
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
about which communities are receiving
 
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.430 align:start position:0%
about which communities are receiving
the

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%

um the 15
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I can say that um those those
 
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
communities are the ones that filed
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
their own lawsuits and they include all
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
10 counties
 
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.210 align:start position:0%

distributed to those 23 subdivisions
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire uh the the New
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute uh we anticipate I

trust fund we have approximately 38
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
most of that money came from a one-time
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
settlement that the Attorney General
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
reached with Johnson and Johnson to
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
settle our opioid lawsuit with them we
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
went on our own we didn't join the
 
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
national settlement and uh New Hampshire
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
received a one-time payment of 31
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars last fall from J J to
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
settle their opioid claims in New
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so all of that money is in
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
there but as Senator Rosenwald said
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
these are structured settlements they're
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
they're all individual settlements with
 
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
all individual terms some of a result of
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy proceedings that are yet to
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
be resolved some have been resolved and
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
that there will be periodic payments
 
00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:09.019 align:start position:0%
coming in over the next 17 to 18 years
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
my estimate is that
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day that New Hampshire
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
will receive about 310 million dollars
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
over 18 years so this commission will be
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
functioning for a long time uh and will
 
00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:25.970 align:start position:0%
functioning for a long time uh and will
be

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
um uh trying to figure out the best most
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
effective ways of using the money to
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
help address the opioid crisis by law
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
and by bankruptcy settlement all of the
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
monies have to be used for opioid
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
abatement purposes things like treatment
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
transportation to treatment housing for
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
people coming out of treatment drug
 
00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:46.810 align:start position:0%
people coming out of treatment drug
court

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:46.820 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
for naloxone for medication assisted
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
treatment which is the most effective
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
way of treating people with an opioid
 
00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:55.970 align:start position:0%
way of treating people with an opioid
addiction

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
that you have about the settlements and
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh and any other questions that you may
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
have for me
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions uh representative
 
00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:08.329 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions uh representative
Merchant

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to the funds being used for
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
treatment abatement if you will is there
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
any focus on trying to build programs to
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
prevent the use of opiates in the first
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
place yes well there is so as the
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
senator said the statute contains 15 or
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
so permitted uses of the opioid money so
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
the grant the the grant applications
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
have to conform with one or more of
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
those uses there is a there is a An
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
approved use for prevention work
 
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
especially in schools and so that would
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
now be dependent upon uh schools and
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
other organizations who would make
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
proposals to do exactly that and if they
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
did then that would be uh considered by
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
the by the commission we make
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations so the governor and
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
executive Council for the actual funding
 
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.750 align:start position:0%
executive Council for the actual funding
decisions

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up is the
 
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.449 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up is the
restriction

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
limited to schools or could it be used
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
for something to do with adults because
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
part of from going with this is we have
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
a house bill 66. and party it is trying
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
design if we if you would the ability to
 
00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:28.339 align:start position:0%
use none
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
pharmacological Therapies in order to
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
not utilize as much an opiates to begin
 
00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:34.550 align:start position:0%
not utilize as much an opiates to begin
with

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
and part of that is trying to figure out
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
how we can fund that kind of initiative
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
because if we can keep people from using
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
opiates in the first place
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
do we minimize the issue we're dealing
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
with to be today
 
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think that they could clearly be a way
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
if if an organization a non-profit or a
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
a state agency or a local government had
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
a proposal I think that they could they
 
00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:04.459 align:start position:0%
could certainly fit it into the the
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
approved uses that are in the statute
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is uh Jake Barry
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair honorable members
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jake Berry
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice president of the vice
 
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
president of policy of new Futures as
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
many of you know new Futures is a
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan non-profit Health policy and
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization we've been working
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
for nearly 25 years to address alcohol
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
and substance use issues in our state I
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat too much of what's
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
been said this morning but I do want to
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
emphasize new future strong support for
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically we support the
 
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
provisions that clarify that the opioid
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
debate and trust fund can be used to
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
support harm reduction programs as well
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
as the language that requires the trust
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
funds advisory commission to work in
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
coordination with the governor's
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
and other relevant State plans
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
first and foremost harm reduction as I'm
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
sure you all know is an approach that
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
emphasizes engaging directly with people
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
who use drugs to prevent overdose and
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
connect individuals to treatment it's
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
increasingly recognized as a critical
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
part of the Continuum of substance use
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
disorder services this proposal to add
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
harm reduction reference in the bill as
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
primary secondary and tertiary
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
prevention and program Services is a
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
natural extension of the work of the
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
trust fund and would build on the
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
legislature's work from last year adding
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
prevention programming in SB 275.
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
incorporating the harm reduction would
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
close the loop and would ensure support
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
ensure the full Continuum of sud
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
Services can be funded through the trust
 
00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.410 align:start position:0%
Services can be funded through the trust
fund

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
in addition we believe that empowering
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
the fund to work in coordination with
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission and in
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
alignment with other state plans will
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
enhance the coordination of these bodies
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
and ensure a comprehensive funding plan
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
for substance misuse programs throughout
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
our state uh with that we ask you to
 
00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I'm happy to take
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you questions
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
from committee members
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
taking my question in in your experience
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
with the uh what's the different success
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
rate for this programs for people for
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder especially in
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
um specifically around how production
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
harm reduction programs uh no like if
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
somebody has a substance you uh you use
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
disorder with opioids like what's the
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
success relatives that person uh
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh participates in one of those programs
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
how many of them stop abusing opioids
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
sure sure I can tell you so I I don't
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
have the data in front of me but you
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
know there are many different parts of
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
the Continuum of services for some
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
substance use tradition each one of them
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
comes with different different data and
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
different success rates as you say
 
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly we see harm
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
reduction as addressed in the provisions
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
of this bill as you know a really
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
important piece to connect with people
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
who aren't ready to fully enter the tree
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
in the treatment system yet right you
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
know people who for whatever reason are
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
still determined or still experiencing
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and and so in
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
active use of of substances um you know
 
00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:38.059 align:start position:0%
provide adding them with the you know
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
with clean needles clean equipment
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
really prevents fatal overdoses uh you
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
know it prevents deaths uh it also is an
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
incredible opportunity to connect people
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
with information about treatment
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
programs for when they are ready to
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
enter treatment protocols so
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I I can get you more
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
hardened data but it is uh you know here
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and all across the
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
country these kind of harm reduction
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
programs are are just seen as a critical
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
entryway to getting people into the
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment continual
 
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:09.860 align:start position:0%
sure thank you other questions
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%

handed out there's a diagram is that
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%

colleague who drafted and crafted that
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh that that testimony uh so I I don't
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%

saying no other questions okay thank you
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Jenny O
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
Higgins from the Department of Health
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:02.529 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:19:02.529 --> 00:19:02.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you so much for
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
having me and I'm Daniel Higgins I'm the
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for Behavioral
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
Health for DHHS so the department has
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
um worked closely with the commission on
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
all of this work and is in support of
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
all of the language changes really
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to just be here today because we
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
did submit a fiscal note on this bill
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
but because the actual language changes
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill are not what are not
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
what makes the need for positions in the
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
department that language was removed in
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so I just wanted to make
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
sure to talk a little bit about the
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
capacity for the Department to make sure
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
to move the opioid abatement funds
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
quickly and monitor and oversee them
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
um really well and so that that's one
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
piece that we just wanted to make sure
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
to talk about today so all of the
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
language pieces everyone else has
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
already spoken to they are best practice
 
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
and Progressive and help us to
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
destigmatize these issues they also make
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we're serving people
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
appropriately with evidence-based
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
practice says so in full support of all
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
the language changes we also worked
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
closely on around making sure to
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the department so we
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
can get those solicitations out
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
um so really what we had put in our
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
initial fiscal note was around having
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
three positions one that is currently
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
funded with these opioid abatement funds
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
today that was approved by the
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
commission August 1st 2022 but we are
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
looking to codify that position so that
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
they can continue to monitor all of
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
these solicitations get the procurements
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
out in a timely manner and get them to
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
contract and additionally we were
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
looking to have a part a part-time
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
auditor and an accountant to
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
specifically work on this fund and those
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
positions are all mirrored after other
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
programs that we have of a similar size
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
So based on the amount of funding and
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
how we move that funding through the
 
00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.770 align:start position:0%
how we move that funding through the
department

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you taking questions sir
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
yes any question our representative
 
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
yes any question our representative
Shapiro

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
taking this question this may be
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
tangential to this bill but having you
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
know hearing about the FDA approval for
 
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
Max alone over
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
over the counter
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
um and seeing that this bill talks about
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
opioid reversal agents and the
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for them
 
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.890 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for them
um

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:23.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
is it within your purview to know how
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
those will interact with each other will
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
the state be reimbursing
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
less people will more people be being
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
have having to be paid pay for these
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
counter approval has happened but it's
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
not in it has not had implementation so
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
we don't know all of the details of how
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
that will roll out at this point I see
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
it as additional potential access but if
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
people don't have health insurance
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
coverage and go to get that
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter they may or go to pay
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
for these things they may not be able to
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
afford them so making sure that we
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
continue to have
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
um any opioid reversal agents available
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
through Statewide funding at this point
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
our federal grants still support the
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
purchase and distribution of naloxone
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
and we would continue to do that from
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
the safe perspective and the
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter would just add an
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
additional access for potentially for
 
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.630 align:start position:0%
additional access for potentially for
people

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you sure representative Weber
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question I want to back up a
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
little bit because you were talking
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal note and I'm
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
apologizing because I've lost all
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
control over my email uh have we had the
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note or did you say you withdrawn
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note or
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
um I didn't quite understand I it sounds
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
to me like you've got one funded
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
position that you are confirming in this
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and then you're asking for
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
the auditor and part-time yes thank you
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
very much and could you just point me to
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
where that is and uh point me to whether
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
you have a fiscal note or have sent the
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal note or do it what what's
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
happening with the fiscal note thank you
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
I need to just take a breath and slow
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
down I think too because I'm coming in a
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
little bit few minutes late from
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
something else so need to wrap my brain
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
around this and better explain myself so
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping me clarify that so
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
we submitted a fiscal note work she does
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
the department the legislative budget
 
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.310 align:start position:0%
the department the legislative budget
assistant

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
said that the positions are not due to
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
the changes made in this legislation and
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
so the positions actually would have
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
been needed in the legislation when it
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
passed in 2020 however we didn't we
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't received in money at that time
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
when we passed this initial piece and we
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
were working to build up the commission
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
to get to a place where it was ready to
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
do a procurement now that we're starting
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
to move funding and we're realizing the
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
amount of funding that will flow through
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
the department we want to make sure we
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
can move that at a steady Pace that we
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
can put these procurements out quickly
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
that we can get the contracts into place
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and that we can monitor and oversee the
 
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.750 align:start position:0%
and that we can monitor and oversee the
contracts

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
um in an efficient way and so for those
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
reasons we've recognized the need for
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
the positions the commission also
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
recognized that need for a position and
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
at this time has funded one project
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
manager for the for abatement
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
and additionally we're looking to add an
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
auditor and finance person to continue
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
to move the contracts and we based those
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
positions on other similar size grants
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
like State opioid response and our block
 
00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:44.029 align:start position:0%
like State opioid response and our block
grants

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
sure follow up
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay so I got that last bit the first
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
time around so am I correct that what
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
you're saying is we're just not thinking
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
about those positions in the context of
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
this legislation this legislation is
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
what it is and you will seek those
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
positions elsewhere
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
so I think we could do we have several
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
potential ways forward one is that the
 
00:25:08.409 --> 00:25:08.419 align:start position:0%
commission has already
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
funded one of the positions right so we
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
could go to the commission and ask for
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
the funding for the three positions in
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
um it could be potentially codified the
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
position could be codified in this piece
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
of legislation or through hb2 right so I
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
think those are sort of three Pathways
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
so all I'm really trying to nail down is
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
whether there is or is not a fiscal note
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
whether there is going to be or is not
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
going to be a fiscal note and maybe the
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
question is for Mr chairman whether this
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
is going to finance after it finishes
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this is an early Bill
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay I don't believe it is okay well and
 
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:52.700 align:start position:0%
and if if the fiscal note is being
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
divided off from this it wouldn't be so
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
um uh I think I think I've clarified the
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
situation enough for my purposes given
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
that we're the policy committee anyway
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you thank
 
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
you for taking thank you other questions
 
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:12.500 align:start position:0%
from committee members I representative
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking Mr chairman and think of
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
what they can my question basically the
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
same question you mentioned
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach and I wonder
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
when we are talking about three-month of
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh substance use just all this like what
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
percentage of people in different
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
programs stop using opioids as a result
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
of participating in those programs that
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
are funded through this method
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
so at this time the first round of
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
funding has just gone out and so there
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
isn't we don't have the actual the
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
tracking of what this funding direct
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
outcomes to that because this is the
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
very first time we've done a procurement
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
with this funding
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
but are you asking about how often
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
like when you choose the best programs
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
like what outcome you expect to expect
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
like the 10 percent stop by using
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
opioids or what the success rate that uh
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
currently is acceptable
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
ful other chronic illnesses
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
diabetes and decent is where there are
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
stunned you know genetics environmental
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
factors and the individual and those
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
risk factors so tends to but depending
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
on the treatment and the individual
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
tends to be
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
um in the 30 to 50 percent range of
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
depending on how you define success and
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just advised
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
by represent by Ms Dyer it is an early
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
bill this is going to go to finance Echo
 
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
so so we can push all of that off
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none okay thank you very much
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 32 does anyone else wish
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to close the public
 
00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:27.659 align:start position:0%

uh I'm gonna make this uh short and
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
sweet I know that the department
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
provided me a whole bunch of bullet
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
points but I'm going to let them speak
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
to it
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
um many of the bills that that we deal
 
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:36.380 align:start position:0%
with uh and especially the uh
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know if you if you look at
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise we fix little things
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that we missed you know when we did the
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
Bills in the first place and again this
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill does a lot of that when we shifted
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
the program uh from oplc Back to the
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
department uh there is a few things that
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
we need to clean up and certainly the
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
department is here to talk about those
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
and because my voice is what it is I'm
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to stop there unless there's any

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:08.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
regarding the uh the pdmp
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
so the background of this bill is that
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
on July 1st 2021 uh
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
the pdmp was transferred from the office
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure and
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
certification to the Department of
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services via house bill
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
2. and since that time we've identified
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
some remedial needs for some remedial
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
legislation so this bill is a cleanup
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill with a number of technical fixes
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
that were overlooked in the transfer
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
from H from oplc to HHS
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
senatal 34 proposes the following it
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
replaces instances of program
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
administrator with commissioner to
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
reflect the appropriate entity for
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory enforcement consistent with
 
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
other programs run by an executive
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
branch agency it corrects the name of
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs with uh with regard to a uh
 
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:09.140 align:start position:0%
The pdmp Advisory Council membership
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
it transfers two provisions of law back
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
to oplc which were transferred to DHHS
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
and error one having to do with the
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
definition of chronic pain
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
and the other having to do with uh
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
prescriber competency requirements uh
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
those are more appropriate to uh to have
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
remained with oplc oplc is the support
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
of those changes
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they're here to testify
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
but they send their regards and lastly
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
and perhaps most importantly what the
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
bill does it allows the department to
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
release aggregate de-identified pdmp
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
data by County
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
when the when the program was
 
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.849 align:start position:0%
when the when the program was
transferred

00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
um via House Bill 2 a provision was
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
added that added a very strict
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
confidentiality requirement a specific
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
site to a specific HIPAA provision would
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
known as The Safe Harbor standard and
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
what that requires is that that requires
 
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.050 align:start position:0%
what that requires is that that requires
that

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh data cannot be released except on a
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide level with one exception
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to release data based on
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
zip code the first three digits of a zip
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
code so what you see in the handout um
 
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:24.740 align:start position:0%
is a is a is a visual of that zip three
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
mapping over the uh over the state and
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
you can see that it's not aligned with
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
any county lines
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and so the request here is to allow
 
00:36:36.609 --> 00:36:36.619 align:start position:0%
us to uh allow the department to release
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
de-identified aggregate data by County
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
like the pdmp has historically done and
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
um that so that that data can be used
 
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
um effectively with other county level
 
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.589 align:start position:0%
um effectively with other county level
data

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's the uh that's the bill it's
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
a it's remedial
 
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
um I understand that uh um
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant may have an
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
um regarding the first point
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
um the program administrator to
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner we've worked
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
collaboratively collaboratively with
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant um and I believe
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
the language he has uh in his back
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
pocket is agreeable to us uh as well
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to take any any
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions uh regarding the the so the
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
legislation instead of kind of like a
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill is I would absolutely
 
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:22.820 align:start position:0%
consider this a housekeeping Bill
 
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:26.300 align:start position:0%
oh oh I'm sorry
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that was a laden term I
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Weber and my
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
apologies I'm behaving badly here it's
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
just we have had in the past many
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bills which turned out to
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
make significant programmatic changes so
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's always a little bit of a red flag
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
for us but
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
um I just I
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
I know that my county is sixth from the
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
top in population uh I assume the cost
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
is the smallest county do you know what
 
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
the population of colossa is is it over
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
the twenty thousand that it is over the
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand yes I just I should know
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
that but thank you um right interest
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
interestingly if I if I may
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
um the uh we we do have a zip three
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
designation that is under 20 000 people
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
um which which makes releasing zip three
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
data even uh well impossible because we
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
we the the allowance is to really zip
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
three data for
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
um areas that have under uh more than
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand so even under this law
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
you know the current scheme we can't
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:46.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
first a comment and a question
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to recognize Mr Holt for the
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
work he's done in the prescription drug
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
monitoring program we don't always see
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
III but I think collectively a lot has
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
been accomplished and this is an example
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
what I did
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
work with Mr hold on and also Mr
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
Williams is where it said program
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
my concern was
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
who in the program is going to be the
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
one to sign a release
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
because it's too broad what we agreed on
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think is to have designated program
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
staff so the commissioner can designate
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
somebody in the staff do work on her
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
behavior his behalf and not have a sort
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
of open-ended and that's kind of the
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
language we have come to I think an
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
question Mike it's
 
00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:44.690 align:start position:0%
question Mike it's
um

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
I'll agree that everything that was
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned above seems like a
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
housekeeping you know update but
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
um the last bullet is that consistent
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
with uh Federal HIPAA
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
um protocol when releasing data by
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
counties in other states or how does
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
that work elsewhere is that something
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
that was missed and we are just catching
 
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
up with the federal standard for HIPAA
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.109 align:start position:0%
or not
when

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
the program was transferred from lplc to
 
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.910 align:start position:0%
the program was transferred from lplc to
HHS

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
a provision was added to the law which
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
required compliance with the Safe Harbor
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
standard for HIPAA so that was a change
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
however once it was once we tried to
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
implement that became clear that uh that
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
was not something that would work with
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
all of our data because we can't we need
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
to release this at least by County data
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
um so it is a there are multiple levels
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
of HIPAA standards
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the one in the law is the Safe Harbor
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
standard this bill still establishes
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
that Safe Harbor standard but allows for
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
a carb out with regard to locational
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
data to allow us to release that by
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
County so I I would I would say that
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a mix of you know a
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
standard HIPAA standard um and a New
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire version of maintaining that
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
standard with a carve out
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up so it's technically
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
then a quasi housekeeping type of change
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you you're welcome
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%

00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
safety of our community in summer camp
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
and camps are required by DHHS to have
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
nurses on staff
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
and so we've worked closely on this bill
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
with the nurse Association and agreed to
 
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.060 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
the bill is a continuation of a policy
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
and law that has already been in place
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
for the last several years with the
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic Senate bill 277.
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
um we see this bill allowing camps to
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
continue to get qualified nurses quickly
 
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.010 align:start position:0%
continue to get qualified nurses quickly
um

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
really you know being a healthcare
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
professional as well as a camp director
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm acutely aware of the Staffing
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
challenges you are all aware of
 
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:20.060 align:start position:0%
um you know our
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get nurses at this point
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
and and the cost is high and so camps
 
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
are particularly challenged because we
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
are seasonal and we are having to be
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
more flexible in terms of how we're
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
bringing nurses in so it might be for a
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
week or a weekend that we have a nurse
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
on staff
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
um and it is really essential that we're
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
able to get that nurse licensed as quick
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't have several months
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
leading into sometimes bringing those
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
nurses into camp and this um our hope is
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
this will help continue
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
um that previous Senate bill um to allow
 
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:06.059 align:start position:0%
to nurses to get licensed quickly
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
um open to questions thank you oh yes
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you this is just a simple question
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
in the analysis of the bill it it says
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners I think it means
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
practicing nurses yes okay thank you
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Weber
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
so if I'm reading the bill right what it
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
does is it allows retired nurses who
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
retired in good standing and have kept
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
up continuing education requirements to
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
perform these duties and it also allows
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
not yet qualified nursing students under
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances to also perform
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
the duties is that correct correct the
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
the second part of the question with you
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
know not yet they're not yet licensed
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
um the concept is again you can see that
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
there's a supervision aspect put in
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
there for them as well and that would be
 
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:08.180 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question if I may Mr chair
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
the follow-up question is it it says
 
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
uh I've lost my place here uh directly
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
supervised while providing Health Care
 
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:25.940 align:start position:0%
Services uh does direct supervision
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
require the supervisor to be on site or
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
what exactly is contemplated by direct
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
Supervision in this in this instance
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think that the employed by
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
part is I'm not sure I have a good
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
answer to that I think it definitely
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
you're correct it does leave
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
probably someone you know interpretation
 
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and and the Nurses Association
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
probably right would have some idea
 
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.059 align:start position:0%
around what I'll say but then thank you
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
very much representative Merchant thank
 
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr and also thank you for taking the
 
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.630 align:start position:0%
you Mr and also thank you for taking the
question

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
I understand today
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
oplc can issue a temporary license for
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
up to I think it's 100 120 days
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
if they can do that today then why do we
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
need this bill
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
so right now the Senate Bill 277 is in
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
place till June 30th and then that goes
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
away and they won't be issuing
 
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
um unless so I'm looking at the RSA 310a
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
and it talks about issuing temporary
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
licenses okay
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm totally aware of
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I do know prior is that something
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
um that was between in the last four
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
years it was authorized according to
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
this on July 1st became Act of the 2021.
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm not saying not to do this
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
but yeah one of the other concerns that
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
I have Mr chair sure is I understand
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
about nursing students I want to involve
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
and representative Weber's question
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
as a student is a supervision of it
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about having a student
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
who hasn't passed their exams yet and
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
what kind of supervision they're going
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
to have because
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
they probably leave all the people on
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
this list of people who can do this need
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
more supervision and I think having
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
somebody remotely supervising them
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
I find problematic if they're not
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
literally on site
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
Murphy my name is Chairman and thank you
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what division or
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
Department you practice in a DH right
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
now but my question would be is there a
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
particular expertise that's required for
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
a camp nurse
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
um so if you're a Rheumatology nurse
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
practitioner you may not be familiar
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
with bug bites or you know allergic
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
reactions or broken bones I mean there's
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
a spectrum of the kids pathology that
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
may come in and I wasn't sure if the
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
camp nurse has any I wouldn't say
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
specialized but any differential
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
training that's required to get into the
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
camps so there isn't specific
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
um training that is required
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the hiring process you
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
know you would
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
cancer hiring people who are qualified
 
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
candidates right so I think um those
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
people hiring are are aware of what's
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
you know needed in in the camp setting
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
um as well so part of this is right you
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
know there's only so much access to a
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
certain number of nurses and especially
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
um not having all the
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
um the states in a compact licensing
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
licensing situation so nurses also have
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
what we call the compact license where
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
you can go over States but it doesn't
 
00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:06.020 align:start position:0%
exist for all of our surrounding states
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
um being very familiar with the camps in
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire obviously
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
um is there a a staff to camper ratio
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
that you have to maintain uh in these
 
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.490 align:start position:0%
that you have to maintain uh in these
camps

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
camps
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so for instance you may have a
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
contestant which has I don't know how
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
many X number but then you have your
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
Camp which has a large number perhaps on
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
webasaki is there a ratio that you have
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
to maintain there's there's a minimum
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
number of nurses that need to be on site
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
as far as licensing per camper yeah
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
president okay thank you
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions okay thank
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
I have no other cards from people who
 
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
have signed up does anyone else wish to
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill 87
 
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.210 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill 87
.

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
.
 
00:57:01.089 --> 00:57:01.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
and turn this off either so thank you
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
um so just going back I I we we're all a
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
little fuzzy on the um direct
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
Supervision in this uh bill so
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm also just wondering in on page
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
to online 27
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
um where it says that the student has to
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
be employed by or providing health care
 
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
services at the direction of a licensed
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility or licensed health
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
care provider does that mean
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
um that the camp has someone above them
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay so correct so camps are are
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
required to have some sort of
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
someone who is putting
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
um orders in place so many camps have a
 
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:53.420 align:start position:0%
relationship with a hospital or facility
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
if not a medical director
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
that helps thank you
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Merchant following
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
up on uh representative cushman's
 
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.329 align:start position:0%
up on uh representative cushman's
question

00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
I haven't been on the Board of Pharmacy
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
and the award directly supervised became
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a concern
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
because it was being supervised
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
through technology not because the
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
person was actually on site and the
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
board had a concern because if you're
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
remotely available to somebody and
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
something happens you're not there
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
physically to deal with the problem
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
would you be amendable to putting down
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
the individual's correct is directly
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
supervised by an on-site
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
so somebody's actually physically on
 
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.089 align:start position:0%
so somebody's actually physically on
site

00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
versus it being interpreted be
 
00:58:42.609 --> 00:58:42.619 align:start position:0%
through a um
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I I would obviously have to speak to
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
the organization I think we would
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
discuss that I think we we definitely
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
discussed though what is directly
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
supervised and how that could look I
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
think the intent for many of these
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
nursing students would be in
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
in camps where we have several nurses
 
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
right at once so your question around
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know some of our camps have you know
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
four nurses at a time and some have one
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
so the one nurse might you know again
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
not be is is hopefully not the intent
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
um since it seems to me that that
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
um these were previously licensed nurses
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
but that will be given a license
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
um a temporary license once they're
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
hired by
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll be under the
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the licensing board for
 
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
nurses yeah is there any
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
is there any issue with these licenses
 
00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.270 align:start position:0%
is there any issue with these licenses
being

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.069 align:start position:0%
being
um

00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
provided quickly enough to actually
 
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
um make people available for the the
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
camping season well so that actually I
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
think is the is the issue the the whole
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
intents of this is
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
is to help move those along as quickly
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
as possible because right now
 
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.430 align:start position:0%
as possible because right now
um

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
or pre I would say pre-pandemic we would
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
be four months you need to four months
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
of having to submit for a nursing
 
01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.650 align:start position:0%
of having to submit for a nursing
license

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:29.660 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
I think we probably get a skewed view
 
01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
but we hear a lot of you know the
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
complaints about
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
um you know how long these things take
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
we don't ever hear or if they happen
 
01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:41.930 align:start position:0%
we don't ever hear or if they happen
efficiently

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if that would be
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
an issue yeah and I think that that is
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
the I would say the pre-pandemic before
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
we had this this language similarly in
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
place for the Senate bill and again I
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
don't know the inner workings of the
 
01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
licensing office but it's been
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
way better which is why at this point
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know the camping industry said wait
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
a minute like if we could continue doing
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
this this would be great right because
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
it has allowed us to not have that
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
headache of like oh my gosh our nurse is
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
trying to get licensed four months ago
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
and we're about to start camp and I
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
can't we don't have a licensed verse so
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
this would improve that yeah thank you
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
 
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.190 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have a
question

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.829 align:start position:0%
 
business

01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay sorry I didn't mean to skip over
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
you there
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
um any other questions
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're I think we're done
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
and again does anyone else want to
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
testify on Senate Bill 87 I have no one
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
else signed up
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
if not then I am going to close the
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 87 we're
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
being very efficient so far today
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and the next hearing is not scheduled
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
until 10 45 so we'll be in recess for 15
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
minutes at which time we will reconvene
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
and hear testimony in Senate Bill 171.
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:05.880 --> 01:21:34.550 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee offer the record I'm Denise
 
01:22:09.649 --> 01:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
rashardi from uh District 9. I represent
 
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh 13 towns in Bedford where I live and
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
then South and West upwards
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce Senate Bill 171
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the definition of
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
Youth recreational programs of which I
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
am the prime sponsor
 
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 171 makes a very small
 
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
change that will have a significant
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
impact on our child care in the state of
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the legislation in front
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
of you allows recreational programs such
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
as those chartered by the Boys and Girls
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
Clubs Of America
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
YMCAs and ywcas who offer before and
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
after school care programs to be able to
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
serve our school-aged children
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the early 1990s the legislature
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
adopted a child care licensing exemption
 
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
for recreational programs who served
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
children six years of age or older
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
uniquely designed to accommodate the
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
child care needs of working parents
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
while recognizing the enhanced safety
 
01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.169 align:start position:0%
while recognizing the enhanced safety
protocol

01:23:14.169 --> 01:23:14.179 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
and staff training requirements of these
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
National organizations and its enactment
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
the threshold age of six years was
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
considered appropriate in light of the
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
expected age of children who needed
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
supervision before and after school
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
however since that time the state has
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
allowed communities to enact full-day
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
kindergarten programs that enroll
 
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
school-aged children who may be younger
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
than six years as a result of the
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in these two age limits
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
the Boys and Girls Clubs and their
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
fellow recreational programs are not
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
able to accept some of the children of
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
families that the recreational program
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
exemption was designed to benefit even
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
though the characteristics of the need
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the program offered and
 
01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the provider are
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
essentially identical
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
as you all have heard and seen
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
anecdotally the need for additional
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
capacity in our child care and before
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
and after school space is not it's at an
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
all-time high we believe that this
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
meaningful change will give parents and
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
caregivers another source of quality
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
programming that will allow them to
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
maintain employment and stay in the
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
workforce today you will hear testimony
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
from providers who think that this is
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
common sense enhancement to our statute
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
and from families who would benefit from
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
the change it's for these reasons that I
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
ask you to find Senate Bill 171
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you're taking
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
questions senator
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
I mean some questions but I do have the
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
experts behind me if I can't do a good
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
job for you we'll have them come up any
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator rashardi
 
01:24:59.770 --> 01:24:59.780 align:start position:0%
it's representative Weber
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
I just had one what are we contemplating
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
by the term school age which is the nub
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill are we talking kindergarten
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
on or if there are
 
01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:14.540 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
I just I just wonder if we could have a
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
more precise statement about what we're
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
talking about there this would allow
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds versus
 
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
to be six years old
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and we did meet in the summer with uh
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
Doreen Shockley from the Department of
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services who was very
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill and actually
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
loved the idea of bringing it forward
 
01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.169 align:start position:0%
loved the idea of bringing it forward
and

01:25:38.169 --> 01:25:38.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
well I I'm wondering I'm very supportive
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the intent my concern is the actual
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
language so uh would you have an
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
objection if we changed it to say
 
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds so that we know what
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about or then maybe I
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
should hold that for other people I
 
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
think you should if you don't mind me my

by our national parent organizations

children we serve
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%

communities and families are embracing
 
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
full day kindergarten and the children's
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
age is of five
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
with increase before and after school
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
care that we see firsthand that sb171
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
makes a critical change to the statute
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
that will allow us to serve our families
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
better not only this kind of current
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
statue makes a child feel excluded when
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
their siblings are currently enrolled
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
our program it prohibits them from
 
01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.470 align:start position:0%
our program it prohibits them from
attending

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
attending
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
but also requires families to scramble
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
for alternative child care
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
recreational programs are critical
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
component that allows families to work
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
as well as enriching activities for our
 
01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.790 align:start position:0%
as well as enriching activities for our
kids

01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents need help
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
finding essential Child Care High
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
as we move forward away from covid-19
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
and a return to normalcy for both
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
parents and their careers and children
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
with their peers is critical according
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
to the most recent data that was
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
provided by after school Alliance for
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
every one child
 
01:29:29.209 --> 01:29:29.219 align:start position:0%
in an after-school program in our state
 
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
there are two on a waiting list
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
well this is not a silver bullet we
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
believe that SB 717 will be another tool
 
01:29:38.530 --> 01:29:38.540 align:start position:0%
of helping New Hampshire
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
effectively chip away to the child care
 
01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
accessibility issue I want to thank you
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
for your consideration consideration and
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
respectfully asking to miss Bill ought
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be passed I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions as well as I have letters from
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
parents that support this bill
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've now
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
formulated better my question to the
 
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.090 align:start position:0%
formulated better my question to the
senator

01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:07.100 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
what my concern is is
 
01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
if we have different districts that have
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
different offerings
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
and once again this is a child care bill
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
that came from to us for reasons that I
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
don't understand because I don't have
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area but if we have
 
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.950 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area but if we have
different

01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
districts that are offering different
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
schooling programs at different ages
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
do we want to tie the language of this
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
bill to school age which might vary from
 
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
District to District or do we want to
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
have it age specific and that's a
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
question that I'm asking because my town
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
for example offered full day
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten for a decade and a half
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
before kindergarten it was even required
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
but other districts very close by did
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
not offer kindergarten at all and so in
 
01:31:11.209 --> 01:31:11.219 align:start position:0%
those contexts what is school age I
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
think it's when I don't know whether
 
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
that's even an issue or not so that's
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
really what I'm asking a question before
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
we even propose this bill we met with
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
child care licensing so we are licensed
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
licensed exempt and what we're asking is
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
if we can it is school age so in our
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
community school age would include
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds going to to our
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District so I think if
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
we use that language it would meet the
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
needs of those districts but the school
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
the child care licensing is in favor of
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
this and recognized and that these this
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
legislation was written in 1990s and we
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
have continued to evolve our
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
after-school and child care
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
if I may have one follow-up so what I
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
think you're telling me is you would
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
prefer the language school age to
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
anything more specific because it might
 
01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.930 align:start position:0%
anything more specific because it might
float

01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
float
 
01:32:04.729 --> 01:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
I would like it to float so I can serve
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
more families and if if it's
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the committee that
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
you'd like to save school year a school
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
age including kindergarten I think the
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
key word here is kindergarten well what
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to drive at is
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't even know if there are
 
01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
schools here who do this in New
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but if if a school established
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
a pre-kindergarten program
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
those children in that District would be
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
school age
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
so yep and and
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
I am all for inclusivity
 
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.209 align:start position:0%
I am all for inclusivity
um

01:32:43.209 --> 01:32:43.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering if they're
 
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
if it was contemplated that there would
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
be no floor
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
but on the ages just based on differing
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
needs of kids uh or or whether
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at wordsmithing as to
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether what we need is the word school
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
age or whether we need
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds and I I guess my other
 
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
question would be do some school
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
districts and I'm hoping somebody behind
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
you will actually answer this if you
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer do some school
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
districts admit kids who have reached
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
their fifth birthday some some you know
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
when I went to school there were some
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
that started if you were going to be
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
five by December or some you had to be
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
five by September so it was a different
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
age for every different school district
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
and is that the case now and does it
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
matter and I'm just I'm just trying to
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
educate myself and then find the right
 
01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:46.810 align:start position:0%
educate myself and then find the right
words

01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:46.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:50.060 align:start position:0%
responding sure um I believe and I'm not
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
this is just from my experience with
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
education I believe it's September 30th
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
the child needs to be age five entering
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
kindergarten it's the language of this
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill could say five-year-olds entering
 
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
kindergarten that would clarify
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
everything any preschool programs if the
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
Boys and Girls Club of Manchester was to
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
offer that we would go through child
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
care licensing and get our program
 
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
licensed what we're looking at is
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
kindergarten five years old and up to
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
enroll in our morning and after school
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
programs okay
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate that
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
taking this question so I assume that
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
um statute is currently written that if
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
someone was five they couldn't go to
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
your program they'd have to go to a
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
program that was licensed as a daycare
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
program yes Okay so what are the
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
differences in standards in terms of I
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to give me every
 
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
difference but but what are the
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
generally speaking what are the
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
difference in standards for being
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
licensed as a daycare versus being
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
licensed as a recreational program
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
because we are sending younger we will
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
be sending younger kids to you and does
 
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
through the standards meet their needs
 
01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.129 align:start position:0%
through the standards meet their needs
basically

01:35:10.129 --> 01:35:10.139 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
excellent question yes they do and I
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
think it's ratios so when you think
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
about ratios my background I was a
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
kindergarten teacher many moons ago so
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure our kids have
 
01:35:23.209 --> 01:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
accurate um ratios for our licensing
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're licensed exempt but we do have to
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
follow Boys and Girls Club of America's
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
safety procedures so all our safety
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
ratios all of those requirements if you
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
compared our requirements and
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
competitive child care licensing they're
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
very similar so you know instead of
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
going through the State Licensing we're
 
01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
going through uh Boys and Girls Club
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
America just as the YMCA but there are
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
programs if we were to offer a preschool
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
program I would go and be Child Care
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
license and the ratios would be smaller
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
so that means that the the major
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
difference in your mind is the ratio of
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
children to adults so
 
01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:05.300 align:start position:0%
your program is under Federal under
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are like Countrywide so
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
um but there might be programs that
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
don't have those kinds of guidelines so
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
the ratios might be
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
different they could be different I
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak for all but I when you
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
really think about the program we're
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
talking about and our particular
 
01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
organization but I agree across the
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
board we're all very in tune to what the
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
needs are of a five six-year-olds and
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
making sure we have adequate
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
um ratios as well as safety
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome other
 
01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.930 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome other
questions

01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:40.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative American yeah
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
taking the question is a follow-up on
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
my concern is when you you we use the
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
word school-aged and there's no floor to
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
it um school is to be defined
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
preschool and so forth et cetera whether
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to be included here or not
 
01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
I am I hearing that you would be
 
01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:06.620 align:start position:0%
amendable to change the things to write
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
five years of age at the time to enter
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
kindergarten at least at that point in
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
time this definitive amount does two
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
things one is the fork to it we all
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
understand and number two it's a
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
standard across the whole state
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
01:37:25.209 --> 01:37:25.219 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Cushman
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh our our retract my question and I'll
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
take it offline actually okay
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
so you know all the questions thank you
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh Doreen Shockley from the Department
 
01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
good morning committee chair members of
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
the committee it's a pleasure to sit
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
here before you today and hopefully
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
clarify the questions on regarding the
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
school age program definition
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
um what we did when we met what seems
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
like a very long time ago but
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
um the school age program a school age
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
program is currently defined in RSA 170
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
e colon 2 and includes children who are
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
four years and eight months of age or
 
01:38:24.659 --> 01:38:26.410 align:start position:0%
four years and eight months of age or
older

01:38:26.410 --> 01:38:26.420 align:start position:0%
older
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
is that helpful
 
01:38:35.169 --> 01:38:35.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair any more questions
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
sure you're taking questions okay are
 
01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
you are you are you including a
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
testimony or did you have more to say no
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to no I have no testimony
 
01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
we were here in support of because we
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
met but because there were so many
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the age I thought
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'd clarify that representative King has
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
a question yes uh just can you uh give
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
me that that RSA number again certainly
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 170 Dash e colon 56.
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you no I'm sorry that's a
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
different one
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
170 Dash e colon 2 just finds school age
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
program and there we give the age
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative Shapiro
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll ask you the
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
same question that I just asked
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
basically which is
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
um we're bringing younger kids into a
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
program that currently they have have
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
programs have to be licensed in a
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
different way so from your point of view
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
will the change in standards which were
 
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
referred to mostly As ratios of adults
 
01:39:46.450 --> 01:39:46.460 align:start position:0%
to children
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
will they be adequate for younger kids
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
ratios are also described in rules as to
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
the number of adults per child based on
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
child ages so those would still need to
 
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
be adhered to this is really I don't
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
want to use the word housekeeping I saw
 
01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
what that did last time
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
um but this is really
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
um we were thankful that they brought it
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
to our attention that we have two
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
separate sections of RSA that are in
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
Conflict so this is right size and
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're the same okay
 
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
so the ratios really are still the same
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
so the same same age kids thank you very
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
much you're very welcome representative
 
01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.610 align:start position:0%
much you're very welcome representative
Weber

01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:27.620 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
so we am I correcting thinking we would
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
solve both your needs and my word
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
smithing Problems by uh simply adding
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
school age
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
as defined in 170-e Colon two we would
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
be certainly amendable to that as okay
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
and that way we have the direction and
 
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
reference to where in the statute it's
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
defining it absolutely thank you very
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
much thank you that was all on my other
 
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.890 align:start position:0%
much thank you that was all on my other
questions

01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no other questions thank you
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 171 does anyone else wish
 
01:41:09.729 --> 01:41:09.739 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else uh I'm going to close
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill 171
 
01:41:16.729 --> 01:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
and I am going to open the public
 
01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 240.
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor Senator
 
01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor Senator
Apprentice

01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
good morning chair McDonald and members
 
01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:35.090 align:start position:0%
good morning chair McDonald and members
of

01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
house Health and Human Services for the
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
record my name is suprentice I'm the
 
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
state senator from District Five
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
covering a large part of Grafton some
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
communities in Sullivan and one
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
community in Merrimack County the
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
beautiful town of New London uh for um
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
so Dartmouth Health has asked me to
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 2 Ford 242 forward
 
01:41:57.850 --> 01:41:57.860 align:start position:0%
or in really ease of navigation of care
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would make a change to RSA 141
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
H2 the statute that governs conditions
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
for genetic testing Senate Bill 240
 
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
would allow for a health care facility
 
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
to disclose genetic testing or lab
 
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
results to clinical entities
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
participating in processes related to
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
clinical care or research for the
 
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
patient for example this would allow a
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
health facility to work with a clinical
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
entity to find an Innovative protocol
 
01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
for a patient that's navigating cancer
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
treatment or navigating treatment of Lou
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
Gehrig's disease ALS
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
I do have um I do have a representative
 
01:42:39.649 --> 01:42:39.659 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth Health here that's also
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
going to be able to testify about the
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
impact and the change for patients in
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
this process but I want to say I want to
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
add in addition to my introductory
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
comments two pieces
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
number one is that
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
well first of all
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
right now the way the law stands all we
 
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:01.820 align:start position:0%
can send to these entities that do
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
matchmaking with you know like for
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
cancer patients and for Lou Gehrig's
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
sees patients do match making for
 
01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:11.699 align:start position:0%
protocols for their care to you know
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
hopefully save their life improve their
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
outcomes all we consent is tissue or
 
01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:17.330 align:start position:0%
outcomes all we consent is tissue or
tumor

01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
tumor
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
we are the most restrictive state in
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
terms of sharing this in New England by
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
making this change in the law we would
 
01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:27.260 align:start position:0%
be able to actually send the results
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
that the results and the analysis that
 
01:43:32.209 --> 01:43:32.219 align:start position:0%
facilities like Dartmouth Health are
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
able to do so that is that is really
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
what this change does that's number one
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
and number two I want to speak to
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
consent patients are consented for this
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
this type of testing however concerns
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
have been raised they were raised in the
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
Senate I want to bring up here and work
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
with this committee on the research part
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
of this we want we're going to need to
 
01:43:53.689 --> 01:43:53.699 align:start position:0%
make a change to have make sure that
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's clear that if you are going to if
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
if the patients are consented if their
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
information is going to be used for
 
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
research purposes
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
so that um that'd be happy to work with
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
members of your committee on but uh with
 
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
that I'll end my introductory comments
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions that I can answer
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
and if not again I do have a
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative from Dartmouth health and
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to um get back in
 
01:44:16.619 --> 01:44:17.450 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to um get back in
touch

01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
touch
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh questions any
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
I'm saying none okay thank you okay
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh actually I have no one else signed up
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
to testify does the person from
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health want to testify we do
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
need a pink card from you
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
and please put your microphone on thank
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
you good morning uh for the record my
 
01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:47.699 align:start position:0%
name is Courtney Tanner I'm the director
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
of government relations at Dartmouth
 
01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.629 align:start position:0%
of government relations at Dartmouth
health

01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
um so as Senator Apprentice noted
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
um the statue does drafted currently
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
restricts the disclosure of genetic
 
01:44:59.810 --> 01:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
testing results to other clinical
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
entities including HealthCare Partners
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
in which we have a formal relationship
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
with so this restriction unintentionally
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
prohibits a New Hampshire Healthcare
 
01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.250 align:start position:0%
prohibits a New Hampshire Healthcare
entity

01:45:09.250 --> 01:45:09.260 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
from matching our cancer patients or
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
other types of patients with treatment
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
protocols that involve the use of
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
genomes to create efficiencies
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes entities like Norris cotton
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
Cancer Center or Dartmouth Health
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
Medical Center we are using a third
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
party entity to match patients with the
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment protocols
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
this requirement as as it stands in
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
current statute is a barrier to
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
accessing timely care for our patients
 
01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire a similarly situated
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
patient in a different state would not
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to face this hurdle
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 240 doesn't change New
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health Systems uh consent
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
requirements or our consent processes
 
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
our providers and patients will still
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
have to engage and informed consent
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
practices consent to treat consent to
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
engage in research all Health Care
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
Systems and clinical entities must
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
comply with HIPAA thus this bill does
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
not change that either and we have
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
robust checks and balances to ensure
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
that the appropriate research
 
01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
disclosures are completed and discussed
 
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
with the patients however as drafted
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
today RSA 141 H2 treats genetic testing
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
differently than it does for other
 
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
health than other health information for
 
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
example tissue for tissue treatment
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 240 removes an
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
administrative barrier for providers but
 
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
more importantly for our patients so
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
that a provider can work with their care
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
teams to identify the right treatment
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
protocols for patients and coordinate
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
their and coordinate patient care so I
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
am not a provider I just want to I have
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
an orange badge I'm not a doctor but I
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to highlight two examples of
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
where where we see the statue today
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
creating uh barriers to care
 
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
first today the statute doesn't allow as
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice notice noted it
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow us to work with clinical
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
Partners to find treatment protocols
 
01:47:08.570 --> 01:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
based on genetic testing results
 
01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:09.890 align:start position:0%
based on genetic testing results
um

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
we an example of this is there's a broca
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
gene this is a gene that is found in
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
patients that are at risk for breast
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
cancer I see Dr Murphy shaking his head
 
01:47:21.729 --> 01:47:21.739 align:start position:0%
so that's helpful thank you
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
this knowledge can be used the knowledge
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
of the of the existence of a Bronco Gene
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
can be used to to detect risk for breast
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
cancer but right now our providers can't
 
01:47:37.209 --> 01:47:37.219 align:start position:0%
communicate the presence of that Gene
 
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
without circling back to get additional
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
consent from the from the patient so we
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
can't communicate the presence of that
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
Gene we can't even communicate that
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
genetic testing was done for this
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
patient with our clinical partner
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
when a provider wants to talk about
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
review case review
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
um their patients with their research
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues they can't even disclose that
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
genetic testing was done
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
for example if we have an oncologist
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
who's working with an ovarian with
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
ovarian cancer patients we can't even
 
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
disclose that the existence of the
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
broccoli Gene which is my understanding
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a provider that the
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
bronchogeneous also can be an indicator
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
for ovarian cancer risk we can't even
 
01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
disclose that that Gene exists or that
 
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
or that the genetic testing was done and
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
this is different than tissue treatment
 
01:48:30.490 --> 01:48:30.500 align:start position:0%
or how we how we treat any other testing
 
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
in the Healthcare System
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions I'm also
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions back to our care
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
team who are much more qualified than I
 
01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.830 align:start position:0%
team who are much more qualified than I
am

01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.689 --> 01:48:44.699 align:start position:0%
but that is that is disclose in my
 
01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you question says
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair taking the score to
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things we I've heard about
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
has come to my attention is the use of
 
01:48:59.930 --> 01:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
genetic testing in regards to coverage
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
for medical care or insurance policy and
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
so forth my concern is that if you look
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
at line eight
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
it goes to either clinical care of the
 
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.390 align:start position:0%
it goes to either clinical care of the
patient

01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
my concern is someone misinterpreting
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
that and saying it could go to an
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company to for them to decide
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
upon whether you qualify for
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions and so forth
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
that that's my concern can you address
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
that for me please
 
01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
um that is a question I'm gonna have to
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
take back to our our team
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I would I would just note
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't we don't this as Dr as
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
drafted today as the statue stands today
 
01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
we don't treat other types of uh testing
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
results the way in this in such a
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
restricted way that we do for uh genetic
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
testing and um those concerns don't
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
exist for again I've used this example
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
over and over again but for tissue
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
testing for example
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that that concern
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
would exist but certainly happy to
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
Circle back with you on that okay but
 
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
would you just when you talk to the team
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
be sure that those guard rails on this
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
information so it does not become used
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
against the patient for qualified for
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
medical care and that's where I'm trying
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
to get to with prior authorizations and
 
01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
so forth puts there I just want to be
 
01:50:18.770 --> 01:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
sure that that information is in fact
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
staying within the clinical team
 
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
treating the patient not someone who's
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
paying the bill yeah absolutely I mean
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
so I I would just note that this all all
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
health information is HIPAA protected
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
um we would you have to be mindful of
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
that too that doesn't change those
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
practices and policies
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
 
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you and
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm now
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
really bewildered because uh isn't a
 
01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:46.510 align:start position:0%
really bewildered because uh isn't a
patient

01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.290 align:start position:0%
patient
allowed

01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
when they sign an informed consent
 
01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.290 align:start position:0%
when they sign an informed consent
form

01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
to allow the release of whatever
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
information they choose to release to
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
whatever entity they choose to have it
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
released to already
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
yes but as interpreted as interpreted
 
01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:12.179 align:start position:0%
currently RSA 141 treats genetic testing
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
differently than other types of testing
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
so it would require an additional
 
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
explicit informed consent again or
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
consent to release information again if
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're need if there needs to be care
 
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
collaboration that's the interpretation
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
of our legal counsel so could I have a
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair
 
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.310 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair
um

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
but my question is
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
um if we're releasing sensitive
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
information which is representative
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant has noticed might be used for
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
purposes that were not
 
01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
wanting it to be used for isn't the
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
remedy simply to ask for the specific
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
release from the specific patients and
 
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
isn't that a good thing rather than a
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
bad thing and therefore why would we
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of it I think it is a
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
good thing I think that the concerns
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
again because we're treating this type
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
of information differently I think the
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
concerns come when it's not moment in
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
time so when
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
um say a new treatment protocol comes
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
out and researchers want to go back and
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
look at their at the patient at their
 
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
patient profile to say okay this new
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
this new treatment option is available
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
let me look back to see if I can look
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
back to see who has the broccoli gene or
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
other types of genes that are that are
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
found in genetic testing only that type
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
of Look Back can't even be done they
 
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
can't even they can't even go back and
 
01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
one follow-up yeah another follow-up but
 
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
that's okay but wouldn't the treating
 
01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:46.669 align:start position:0%
that's okay but wouldn't the treating
physician

01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
physician
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
be able to say to their patient oh gee
 
01:52:53.169 --> 01:52:53.179 align:start position:0%
there's a new protocol
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh may I release your information to see
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
if you're you're appropriate for that
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
protocol I'm I'm having a hard time
 
01:53:01.729 --> 01:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
understanding why that's such a problem
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
that would be ideal representative Weber
 
01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:06.179 align:start position:0%
the issue is that a treating physician
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
and a researcher they're not even able
 
01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
to communicate that
 
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the treating Physician's not even
 
01:53:13.609 --> 01:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
able to communicate that that genetic
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
testing happened for that patient with
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
the researcher so there is this gray
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
wall or barrier that exists right now
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
question uh so I just want to be clear
 
01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:30.179 align:start position:0%
this would allow
 
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh providers say a DH to refer patients
 
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
to other clinical institutions say that
 
01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
have different protocols and different
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
treatments that they're doing that it's
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
not done locally is that correct
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
referrals and also allow us to
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
communicate with our third party
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
entities to help us find the appropriate
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
protocols okay just follow up so it's
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
not just the third party entities also
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
the treating excuse me the potential
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
treating facilities that may have
 
01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
different expertise and with whom we can
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
share the the patient's uh clinical
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
information but also their genetic
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
testing and Analysis that's correct
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you yeah
 
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
okay I'm saying no no more questions
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and don't forget the pink card
 
01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.450 align:start position:0%
uh and and don't forget the pink card
please

01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Mike wallow
 
01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
Mike Rolo American Cancer Society cancer
 
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
Action Network
 
01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:42.860 align:start position:0%
in support
 
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
after listening to some of the questions
 
01:54:46.490 --> 01:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
I may have had to reconsider but I'm not
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
sure I want to testify but
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we are in support
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
um I think from the very beginning I
 
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
want to just stress how important
 
01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:55.550 align:start position:0%
want to just stress how important
patient

01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
um privacy is to our organization
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and how serious we take that
 
01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
um I think where we are in support
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
um really comes to where uh
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy has just opened up
 
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
to the conversation where this could
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
potentially open up access to additional
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
clinical trial options for patients
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
um this to us is about access to care
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
it's acts it's a potentially opening up
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
access to different treatment options
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
for patients they may not have other
 
01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:35.649 align:start position:0%
for patients they may not have other
options

01:55:35.649 --> 01:55:35.659 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind their their privacy is
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the utmost importance to us so if
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
there are issues that you all need to
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
work out I will leave that to you
 
01:55:47.590 --> 01:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
um we're not here to speak to that
 
01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
our main goal is advancing research and
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
advancing options for for patients and
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we would be in support of
 
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
legislation like this
 
01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
and with that I think most of the people
 
01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
behind me probably want to get to the
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
next bill so I don't want a Believer I
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
give that impression to you okay us too
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
so okay probably happy to take
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative person's question of
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
course thank you Mr thank you no
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
question would you be willing to propose
 
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
some language that could be added to
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
this bill to ensure we're protecting the
 
01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
privacy of the patient from undue harm
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
because the information was used in a
 
01:56:29.050 --> 01:56:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to help us with
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
grafting language for the bill to ensure
 
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
we Safeguard the information so
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
therefore the information doesn't fall
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
into of course an entity that's going to
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
use it detrimental of course I think I I
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for our our friends
 
01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth but I'm sure they'd be
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
willing to as well I don't think they
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
want to see their patients information
 
01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:51.229 align:start position:0%
want to see their patients information
go

01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere else I mean I think that I'm
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
not from what I'm reading in the bill I
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to be an issue
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
but I I just raise it because it
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative Weber had brought up the
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
issue of uh of the privacy of the
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
patient so that's why I bring it up
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's our always the first thing we
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
think of is the patient's privacy but I
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
have other questions
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
so you know the questions thank you
 
01:57:17.089 --> 01:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman uh I'm Neil
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
Kirk former state representative and I
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be here I
 
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:37.550 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be here I
look

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
I live and where and I'm representing
 
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
myself I have some material to pass out
 
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:00.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I was involved in the
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.199 --> 01:58:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:11.050 align:start position:0%
um

01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%

01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
when I read this bill I was a little bit
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
surprised because
 
01:58:24.729 --> 01:58:24.739 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
that everything the sponsors wish to do
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
can be done currently under law
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
with the consent of the patient
 
01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
Apparently after speaking with Miss
 
01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:40.270 align:start position:0%
Apparently after speaking with Miss
Tanner

01:58:40.270 --> 01:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
Tanner
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
an attorney for Dartmouth has
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
strictly interpreted the language in
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
such a way that even with the patient's
 
01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.850 align:start position:0%
such a way that even with the patient's
consent

01:58:49.850 --> 01:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
they cannot do what they're proposing to
 
01:58:51.719 --> 01:58:52.729 align:start position:0%
they cannot do what they're proposing to
do

01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:54.860 align:start position:0%
I find that very difficult to believe
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
but that's the current situation the
 
01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
problem with their solution to that
 
01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
is that it broadens
 
01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
is that it broadens
the

01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
use of material for both research and
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
clinical treatment
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
and by using the same consent forms as
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're currently using deprives the
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
individual of knowledge of what is going
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be done with a genetic material so
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
when he signs the consent form he's not
 
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
fully informed about what he's
 
01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
if there's some problem with the bill
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
with the with a statute that makes it
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
impossible for Dartmouth to do the right
 
01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
thing by their patients by all means
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
let's check that but let's make sure
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we are making that we are
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
protecting your DNA which once it's gone
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
obviously is totally lost in ways that a
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
normal reasonable patient who is faced
 
02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
with 37 forms that he has to sign every
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
time he goes to the doctor and which he
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
cannot read not realistically
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
except if you're like me you spend an
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
hour in front of the the window reading
 
02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
all of these forms and Crossing out
 
02:00:16.010 --> 02:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
things you don't agree with
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm one out of one million three
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
hundred forty thousand people
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
most people don't have time to do this
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
and it's up to the legislature to act in
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
ways that protect those privacy rights I
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
will try to work with Dartmouth to come
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
up with some sort of an amendment that
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
satisfies their need and also protects
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
the genetic privacy of individuals the
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
handout that I sent you was a letter
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
that I had written to Dr Morrow who
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
testified in the Senate asking him the
 
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
same kinds of questions that I've raised
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh I did not hear back from him I just
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity today to speak with
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
Miss Tanner
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
um she seemed amenable to working out
 
02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
some other language and will proceed to
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
do that so Mr chairman I hope the
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
committee will not act on this bill
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
until you've had an opportunity to see
 
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:08.580 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you Mr chairman I'd be

3. thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
testify in support of Senate Bill 263
 
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
which passed the Senate coming out of
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
24 to nothing and passed
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate 24 to nothing again on a
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
Voice vote coming out of the finance
 
02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.589 align:start position:0%
Voice vote coming out of the finance
committee

02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is the third iteration if you will
 
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.010 align:start position:0%
this is the third iteration if you will
of

02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
um authorizing Medicaid expansion I've
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
been pleased to be involved in all three
 
02:03:20.089 --> 02:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
of the prior pieces of legislation
 
02:03:22.330 --> 02:03:22.340 align:start position:0%
um this bill is
 
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
compared to the previous bills quite
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
simple it does three things it makes
 
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion permanent
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
it reestablishes the oversight
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
commission that was repealed
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2022
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
and it eliminates use of the alcohol
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
fund to fund the state share and
 
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
substitutes if needed liquor fund
 
02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:52.550 align:start position:0%
substitutes if needed liquor fund
Revenue

02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:03:57.050 --> 02:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
what Senate pill 263 doesn't do is make
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
any changes either to session law or RSA
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
126 a a that are already established
 
02:04:07.739 --> 02:04:08.689 align:start position:0%
126 a a that are already established
um

02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay pieces of law in New Hampshire in
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
terms of Medicaid expansion the
 
02:04:17.050 --> 02:04:17.060 align:start position:0%
eligibility stays the same
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
138 percent of poverty people are
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid expansion that's
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
about twenty thousand dollars of income
 
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
for a single individual or forty one
 
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred for a family of
 
02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:33.050 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred for a family of
four

02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
uses the same managed care criteria that
 
02:04:38.109 --> 02:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
Focus On Wellness on Mental Health
 
02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
substance abuse the work requirements
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
remain in place in State Statute and the
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer protection mechanisms that have
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
been part of all three iterations of
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion stay in place and
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
those taxpayer protection
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are a disallowance of General
 
02:05:00.239 --> 02:05:01.570 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are a disallowance of General
funds

02:05:01.570 --> 02:05:01.580 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for the state's 10 percent share
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
a wind down of the program if
 
02:05:12.169 --> 02:05:12.179 align:start position:0%
Federal funding comes in at less than
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
the 90 percent promise share those
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
taxpayer protection mechanisms stay in
 
02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:18.709 align:start position:0%
taxpayer protection mechanisms stay in
place

02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
so I think the question I hope that the
 
02:05:23.089 --> 02:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
question that you will ask that the
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
Senate asked and arrived at a conclusion
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan fashion has Medicaid
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
expansion worked and I believe the
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
answer is a resounding yes
 
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
um package that I've passed out and I
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
trust that there's one for every member
 
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the committee and one extra you'll
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
see that in the individual Market
 
02:05:53.089 --> 02:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
insurance rates have dropped in fact for
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
the targeted population a single 40 year
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
old we have the lowest individual rates
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
in the country that's a result of
 
02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
changes that we made in 2018.
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
the number of people accessing their
 
02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
Health Care at the emergency room has
 
02:06:14.570 --> 02:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
dropped that was also one of the goals
 
02:06:17.890 --> 02:06:17.900 align:start position:0%
of earlier pieces of legislation
 
02:06:21.010 --> 02:06:21.020 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care has dropped
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care is a tax if you will
 
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
a hidden tax on anybody with private
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
insurance in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the individual Market or
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's through their employer
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
because what happens when hospitals have
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
to give care which they're required to
 
02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
do under federal law at the emergency
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
room or some other setting and there's
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
no way to be compensated for that it's
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
rolled into the rates that they
 
02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
negotiate with insurance providers as a
 
02:06:59.570 --> 02:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
hidden tax on whether it's an individual
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
or employers
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion for the individuals
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
that are part of Medicaid expansion is
 
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
not permanent many people have been on
 
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion for a short period of
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
time and then as their life situation
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
changes they're able to leave Medicaid
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
expansion and qualify for other health
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
insurance whether it's through an
 
02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
employer or on the exchange
 
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
we actually have the fourth lowest
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of people on Medicaid of any
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
state in the nation according to the
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.570 --> 02:07:43.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion as you'll see from
 
02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
some of the fact sheets provided has
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
provided enhanced services and access to
 
02:07:54.649 --> 02:07:54.659 align:start position:0%
people with mental health issues as well
 
02:07:58.089 --> 02:07:58.099 align:start position:0%
as substance abuse and obviously our
 
02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
crises our dual crises of Substance
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
Abuse and Mental Health
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we maintain
 
02:08:08.450 --> 02:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
those services
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
and the cost has proven to be affordable
 
02:08:14.209 --> 02:08:14.219 align:start position:0%
the federal government has maintained
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
its 90 percent funding
 
02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
requirement and the state has been able
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
to meet its 10 percent share without use
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
of General funds whether it's liquor
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
funds the insurance premium tax on
 
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:29.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid policies
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Health Plan assessment
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
and other smaller sources of revenue
 
02:08:39.169 --> 02:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
so the question I think that you will
 
02:08:41.089 --> 02:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
hear today and hopefully you will be
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
able to answer as the Senate answered
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
have individuals benefit and I think
 
02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear a lot of testimony
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
from a lot of people the Senate heard a
 
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
lot of this testimony about how people
 
02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
were able with Access to Health Care to
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
change their lives to be able to get
 
02:09:00.890 --> 02:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
into the workforce and Lead productive
 
02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
lives you will also see countless
 
02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
letters and support by various business
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
organizations that know that a healthy
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce is absolutely essential for
 
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
the economy of the State of New
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if you look at all of the
 
02:09:22.490 --> 02:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
Chambers of Commerce that support it the
 
02:09:25.089 --> 02:09:25.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retail association the Bia
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
I was given a letter by the New
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers Association this
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
morning the support among the business
 
02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.030 align:start position:0%
morning the support among the business
Community

02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
Community
 
02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
is Broad
 
02:09:40.609 --> 02:09:40.619 align:start position:0%
the only two issues that came up in
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and discussion in front of the
 
02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.109 align:start position:0%
testimony and discussion in front of the
Senate

02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:09:45.119 --> 02:09:46.250 align:start position:0%
Senate
um

02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
are these two that I
 
02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:50.570 align:start position:0%
are these two that I
recall

02:09:50.570 --> 02:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
recall
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
is Medicaid expansion providing an
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
incentive not to work and I would argue
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
that the opposite is true which is why
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
you have so many business groups and
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
individuals in support of it and
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
referring back to the Kaiser Family
 
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.530 align:start position:0%
referring back to the Kaiser Family
Foundation

02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:08.540 align:start position:0%
Foundation
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
study that shows that we have the fourth
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
lowest percentage of our residents on
 
02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
lowest percentage of our residents on
Medicaid

02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
seventy percent of New Hampshire
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
residents on Medicaid are working that's
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
higher than the U.S average of 63
 
02:10:27.169 --> 02:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
percent and only eight percent uh only
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
eight states have a higher percentage of
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipients that are working so
 
02:10:34.570 --> 02:10:34.580 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of a disincentive
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
clearly not one
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
the other issue is the question of
 
02:10:41.149 --> 02:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
making it permanent and I think that
 
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
after nine years with the taxpayer
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
protection mechanisms we've built into
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
it the wellness incentives that have
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
been built into it how it's helped
 
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
people how it's helped the business
 
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
Community I believe it's time to make it
 
02:10:57.010 --> 02:10:57.020 align:start position:0%
permanent to allow for the most
 
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
cost-effective Contracting with Managed
 
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
Care organizations so Mr chair at that
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
point at this point I'd be more than
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer your questions
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
02:11:14.930 --> 02:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
nice okay no it's representative Cushman
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:11:22.129 --> 02:11:22.139 align:start position:0%
for being here and for taking my
 
02:11:22.139 --> 02:11:23.629 align:start position:0%
for being here and for taking my
question

02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I understand that we have uh you know
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
we've got these reductions in uninsured
 
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
residents and I often hear people kind
 
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
of um conflate
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
um insurance with health and I was just
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are real world
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
um demonstrable
 
02:11:40.679 --> 02:11:42.530 align:start position:0%
um demonstrable
um

02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
um
um

02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
improvements in the health of granite
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
Staters as a result of this program well
 
02:11:49.609 --> 02:11:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:11:51.890 --> 02:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman I think that you
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
will hear the same testimony that the
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
Senate heard from actual individuals
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
who've benefited significantly and I
 
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
think if you look at and hear the
 
02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
testimony from the New Hampshire
 
02:12:05.050 --> 02:12:05.060 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
they will go through the drop in
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care which as I said
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
before is a hidden tax the drop in
 
02:12:18.370 --> 02:12:18.380 align:start position:0%
people showing up at the emergency room
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
and getting care that don't have
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
insurance so I I think that the evidence
 
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear there has been a real
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
world impact on positive Health outcomes
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
for people in 2018 we built a number of
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
Wellness incentives into the MCO provide
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
provision of service and so the Senate
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from the MCA bills and I
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
think you know hopefully you'll hear
 
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
that testimony today about how these
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
Health incentives are actually working
 
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
and should be a part of our
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care system in U.S a healthcare
 
02:12:57.890 --> 02:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
professional no one ounce of prevention
 
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
is a heck of a lot better for the
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
individual than all the cures in the
 
02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
world and if we can prevent illness that
 
02:13:08.209 --> 02:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
should be our goal
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:13:13.129 --> 02:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
oh follow oh I'm sorry representative
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley for taking the question
 
02:13:20.209 --> 02:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
recently there's been because of the
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
pebble government there was expansion of
 
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program itself not so much
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
of this medical side of it
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
and we heard at the Department of Health
 
02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight committee the
 
02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
Department's going through the process
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
of re-qualifying people for Medicaid
 
02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:34.910 align:start position:0%
of re-qualifying people for Medicaid
benefits

02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
can you speak to how that may impact
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
those uh what I'm concerned about people
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
losing coverage
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to encourage here but
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden because what's going on
 
02:13:47.089 --> 02:13:47.099 align:start position:0%
with the federal requirements that they
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
fall off the radar
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
so and I'm sure the department can
 
02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
further answer this question but to try
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
to put it in a nutshell
 
02:13:59.450 --> 02:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
because of a federal requirement during
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
the pandemic if you qualified for
 
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion you could not be
 
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
disenrolled if you no longer qualified
 
02:14:12.609 --> 02:14:12.619 align:start position:0%
until the end of the emergency which
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
was April's first or March 31st so New
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has begun the process per
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations of disenrolling
 
02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
people who no longer qualify because
 
02:14:28.970 --> 02:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
their income has exceeded the 138
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
percent of poverty
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
so that is a process that will occur
 
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
over time the department has estimated
 
02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:38.450 align:start position:0%
over time the department has estimated
that

02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:40.729 --> 02:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
um the historic Trend let me put it this
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
way up until the pandemic was between 50
 
02:14:46.970 --> 02:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
and 52 000 people New Hampshire
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
residents on New Hampshire Medicaid
 
02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
expansion that ballooned obviously
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic because no one could
 
02:14:57.770 --> 02:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
be disenrolled up to over 90 000 people
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
the department estimates that that will
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
go back to about 60 to 65 000 people by
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
the end of the year but part of what the
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
is doing as well as the department of
 
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
insurance is a very vigorous outreach
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
program to those people who no longer
 
02:15:20.649 --> 02:15:20.659 align:start position:0%
income qualify to get them
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
for an opportunity to Avail themselves
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
of the health insurance that exists on
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
the exchanges which in all likelihood
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
they would qualify for or obviously at
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
this point they may qualify for employer
 
02:15:40.729 --> 02:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
sponsored insurance so this change was
 
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
precipitated by the federal requirement
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
to not disenroll during the pandemic and
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
now the federal requirement that that
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
has ended so it's really outside of what
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
we've created in New Hampshire over the
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
years thank you
 
02:16:01.370 --> 02:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
seeing no other question oh I'm sorry
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative pushman thank you Mr
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for taking my
 
02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:07.970 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for taking my
question

02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:16:09.770 --> 02:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
um this one is on the commission to
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate the effectiveness and future of
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
the Granite Advantage Healthcare program
 
02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:16.069 align:start position:0%
the Granite Advantage Healthcare program
um

02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
so can you explain what changes are
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
being made to that
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
um Commission in this bill
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's largely recreated
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Cushman
 
02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:29.930 align:start position:0%
um representative Cushman
um

02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:32.690 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
the and I chaired the
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
prior commission for several years that
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
issued a report last fall so it has
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
three members of the Senate three
 
02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:46.460 align:start position:0%
members of the house
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative of various departments
 
02:16:51.490 --> 02:16:51.500 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
Insurance representatives of the managed
 
02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:56.300 align:start position:0%
care companies
 
02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals a public member we've had
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
public members in the past
 
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:03.830 align:start position:0%
public members in the past
um

02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:06.049 --> 02:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
public member this time representing the
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
interest of small businesses I think
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
that's new
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we've had a licensed physician in the
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
past we've had other licensed Health
 
02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals in the past
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
um I believe the
 
02:17:26.929 --> 02:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder professional is
 
02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
somebody that we haven't had in the past
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
the nurses I think have been represented
 
02:17:35.929 --> 02:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
the chairperson of the alcohol and drug
 
02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment I don't recall if I
 
02:17:40.849 --> 02:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
was a member of doing this from memory
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative but I think
 
02:17:45.530 --> 02:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's a broad
 
02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
it's it's a broad
um

02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
collection of Health Care Professionals
 
02:17:53.209 --> 02:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
legislators and state officials at the
 
02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
two departments that will
 
02:17:58.129 --> 02:17:58.139 align:start position:0%
provide the necessary oversight on an
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis with a report that has to
 
02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:02.530 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis with a report that has to
be

02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:02.540 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
written every year before November 1st
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
on or before so I think if people are
 
02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:10.009 align:start position:0%
on or before so I think if people are
especially

02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:10.019 align:start position:0%
especially
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
with the thought hopefully that this
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
becomes permanent there should be
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
permanent oversight and I would like to
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
believe that this accomplishes that goal
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for running through
 
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
that um so I'm wondering if there have
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
been some other study committee bills
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
coming through here and
 
02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
um the actual voting members have been
 
02:18:35.089 --> 02:18:35.099 align:start position:0%
restricted to members of the legislature
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
and then the other members like for
 
02:18:38.639 --> 02:18:39.889 align:start position:0%
and then the other members like for
example

02:18:39.889 --> 02:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you know if the mcos and public
 
02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
members they served as advisory or um
 
02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
could uh give input and and were listed
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
as you know we want input from these
 
02:18:50.939 --> 02:18:51.889 align:start position:0%
as you know we want input from these
people

02:18:51.889 --> 02:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
um but the actual legislative action
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
taken is by
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
um members of the general court would
 
02:19:01.969 --> 02:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
you be amenable to such a change so as I
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
recall and I'd have to go back and read
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
the prior statute but I think that was
 
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
the case in the um
 
02:19:12.169 --> 02:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 313 which I sponsored in
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
2018 that had only legislative members
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
voting as I recall that was the case
 
02:19:20.929 --> 02:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
when I chaired it I tried to take all
 
02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
voices and sort of tried to come to
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
consensus among all the members so to me
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
that's how it should work whether it's
 
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
specific to legislators only voting or a
 
02:19:37.009 --> 02:19:37.019 align:start position:0%
vote of the entire commission I think
 
02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
either way work for me it depends on you
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
know I think just whoever chairs it has
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
to be as inclusive to all voices as
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
possible okay thank you other questions
 
02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:51.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
and just as a follow-up to
 
02:19:56.290 --> 02:19:56.300 align:start position:0%
um representative cushman's questions
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the function of this
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee is not a legislative one it is
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating writing reports and then
 
02:20:11.929 --> 02:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
reporting to the legislature and others
 
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that further action if needed may be
 
02:20:20.410 --> 02:20:20.420 align:start position:0%
taken by the legislature at that time
 
02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
obviously that is what oversight is all
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
about representative Weber and thank you
 
02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
for that question the
 
02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:27.889 align:start position:0%
for that question the
um

02:20:27.889 --> 02:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
point I would make is that this is the
 
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
fourth version of Medicaid expansion
 
02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:36.770 align:start position:0%
fourth version of Medicaid expansion
um

02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
any member of the legislature can file a
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill at any point in time in the future
 
02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
to make changes
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
um whether
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
this becomes permanent or is something
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
less than permanent I hope it will be
 
02:20:54.410 --> 02:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
permanent but clearly the role of an
 
02:20:56.929 --> 02:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is to provide that
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
kind of input back to and through the
 
02:21:02.290 --> 02:21:02.300 align:start position:0%
three senators and three house members
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
for the other
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
418 members of the legislative body
 
02:21:12.969 --> 02:21:12.979 align:start position:0%
I got my math right
 
02:21:12.979 --> 02:21:14.830 align:start position:0%
I got my math right
424-6

02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
424-6
 
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
this is why I sit on the Health and
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee and not the
 
02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
finance committee that's a pretty easy
 
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
one I'm all right at addition and
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
subtraction sometimes representative
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question I'm
 
02:21:31.969 --> 02:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
looking through a list of individuals on
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's very extensive
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
um one of the the parts that I think
 
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
could be added to it
 
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
drug therapy is a critical critical
 
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
component to healthcare but there's
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
nobody here from the world of Pharmacy
 
02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issues that go on with
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
a major cost we look at the cost within
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
health care it's probably running 17 to
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
19 of the cost but there's nobody there
 
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
from the world of Pharmacy sitting on
 
02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
I would take that as a friendly
 
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Cushman
 
02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
last one thank you
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
thinking now to you know we have some
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
people left out from it um
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to like so when we have this
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list and this is the issue
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
with other study committees and and
 
02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.809 align:start position:0%
with other study committees and and
commissions

02:22:29.809 --> 02:22:29.819 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
um it ends up inevitably leaving some
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
people out
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I made the point of you
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
know leave it open to advisory but I
 
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in here that
 
02:22:44.929 --> 02:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
um directs this commission to take and
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that they could but would you
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
be open to
 
02:22:50.349 --> 02:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
um an amendment to say that they take
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
um to me that always goes without saying
 
02:22:59.210 --> 02:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
but of course that would be I would
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
consider that a friendly Amendment also
 
02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
I mean when
 
02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
um I chaired the commission we always
 
02:23:09.889 --> 02:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
you know made sure to listen to folks
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I know you folks in this committee
 
02:23:14.929 --> 02:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
do that every day and we try to do that
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the Senate but I would see both of
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
those as friendly amendments thank you
 
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions okay thank you
 
02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of announcements uh just to
 
02:23:38.170 --> 02:23:38.180 align:start position:0%
explain how we're going to proceed today
 
02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
understandably we have quite a few folks
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
that want to testify in this bill it's a
 
02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
very important bill and we want to make
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure you all have an opportunity to give
 
02:23:50.270 --> 02:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
us your input accordingly and not the
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
only way we're going to do that is if we
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
limit testimony it's been our policy on
 
02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
major pieces of legislation to what the
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of extra time because
 
02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
they're going through the the details of
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
the bill but after that we do ask that
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
those testifying limit that testimony to
 
02:24:07.630 --> 02:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
three minutes and that will be enforced
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
after your three minutes is up I will
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know ask you to conclude or actually
 
02:24:14.270 --> 02:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a little bit of a heads up
 
02:24:16.429 --> 02:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
as you're approaching a few minutes ask
 
02:24:18.110 --> 02:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
you to wrap up and then ask you if
 
02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to take any questions from
 
02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:22.070 align:start position:0%
the committee
also

02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
um you know as we approach the lunchtime
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
hour I know that your time is valuable
 
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
my recommendation of the committee would
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
be that we continue uh until we're done
 
02:24:34.849 --> 02:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
and members can take lunch as they at
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
their own discretion kind of like a
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
rolling lunches
 
02:24:39.290 --> 02:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
the committee have any objections to
 
02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:40.389 align:start position:0%
the committee have any objections to
that

02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:43.849 --> 02:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
I know there's a budget uh informational
 
02:24:45.530 --> 02:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
session later on this afternoon that
 
02:24:48.170 --> 02:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
some may want to attend also so anyway
 
02:24:50.929 --> 02:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
any questions at all committee members
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
especially a representative Weber
 
02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
I just note that this is all taped so
 
02:24:59.450 --> 02:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
members can fill in the gaps at a later
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
date unlike our prior procedures okay I
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
had an extra big breakfast because the
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
vice chairman is out and I I have nobody
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
to fill in for me so anyway
 
02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
now with all of that being said um the
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
first person to testify is um mark bonta
 
02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know that you were free if you wish
 
02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
to to designate anybody to present in
 
02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
your absence if you would care to do
 
02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
that not that you need to like it's
 
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:44.300 align:start position:0%
certainly been practicing in the past
 
02:25:49.030 --> 02:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:52.090 align:start position:0%
American University
 
02:25:52.090 --> 02:25:54.889 align:start position:0%
American University
[Music]

02:25:54.889 --> 02:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
again sir you were out in the hall but
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes um
 
02:26:01.490 --> 02:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
would you state who where you're from
 
02:26:03.050 --> 02:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
again because I just didn't catch it
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll start over yes sorry about
 
02:26:07.370 --> 02:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
that my name is Mark bonta I'm the plant
 
02:26:09.650 --> 02:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
director for Gen foot American Littleton
 
02:26:11.210 --> 02:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I've been on the state
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
advisory Council for the recovery
 
02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
friendly workplace since 2018.
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
um very passionate about the rfwi Mostly
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
because back in 2011 I had fired an
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
employee for reporting to work under the
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
influence of alcohol
 
02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
and tragically within six months of
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
losing your job she passed away of liver
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
failure because she couldn't stop
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
drinking when I learned about the rfwi
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
it helped me to realize that there are
 
02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
other options that I could have could
 
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
have taken with an employee that has
 
02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder helping them get
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
into recovery instead of firing firing
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
them is namely
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
so in the past five years I've come to
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
realize that anybody that has a strength
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
of character to beat addiction is
 
02:26:56.090 --> 02:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
somebody that I want working for me so
 
02:26:58.130 --> 02:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
I've been working directly with Recovery
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
Home a recovery home local in Littleton
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
and I've hired dozens of employees from
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
that uh from that pool of applicants
 
02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
some of them didn't work out but some of
 
02:27:10.490 --> 02:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
them did and some of the success that
 
02:27:13.250 --> 02:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
can be attributed in large part to the
 
02:27:15.770 --> 02:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
support the mega kid expansion gave them
 
02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
during the first few months of recovery
 
02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
when we hire new employees and this is
 
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
most companies there's a three-month
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
typically a three-month probationary
 
02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
period where they're not yet eligible
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
for health insurance and that uh the
 
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
first few months of recovery is crucial
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
to anyone getting into recovery because
 
02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
they absolutely have to have treatment
 
02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
in order to get the recovery off to a
 
02:27:41.809 --> 02:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
good start and somebody needs to pay for
 
02:27:44.690 --> 02:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
that treatment to fight addiction
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
the recovery-friendly workplace
 
02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
initiative in New Hampshire is now 330
 
02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
workplaces and over 90 000 employees
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
strong and the positive progress is
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
evident you can see it in some of the
 
02:27:58.190 --> 02:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
data that's coming out in regards to
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
overdoses and and such
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
we are all working really hard to battle
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
addiction and we're winning the fight
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
but it's not over yet
 
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
um there's still a lot of work to be
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
done and we need to support the Medicaid
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
expansion gives us to continue the
 
02:28:13.969 --> 02:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
positive progress we've been making
 
02:28:15.889 --> 02:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
so please vote to continue that support
 
02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:18.060 align:start position:0%

representing all of our state's
 
02:29:59.090 --> 02:29:59.100 align:start position:0%

is the CEO of Parkland Medical Center in
 
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
Dairy you have my written testimony so I
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
won't go through it in its entirety but
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
there are a few points that I would like
 
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's hospitals have been have
 
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
been and continue to be partners with
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
the state in caring for our most
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens it is our mission to
 
02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
care for those who are sick and our
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
members work tirelessly to provide the
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
highest quality care to all of our
 
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of their ability to
 
02:30:23.700 --> 02:30:24.830 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of their ability to
pay

02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's hospitals strongly
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
coverage to the Granite Advantage
 
02:30:34.730 --> 02:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
Healthcare program allows patients to be
 
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
seen by a primary care doctor or in a
 
02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
health clinic to receive important
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%

services in short this coverage allows
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
these patients to receive the Right Care
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the right place at the right time
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
as Senator Bradley noted this program
 
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
has helped to reduce the number of
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
uninsured patients seeking Care at
 
02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency rooms since the
 
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
Inception of the program hospitals
 
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
Statewide have seen a 63 percent
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in the number of uninsured
 
02:31:05.210 --> 02:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
patients seeking care in the emergency
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
department a 58 reduction in the number
 
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
of uninsured inpatient Admissions and a
 
02:31:13.490 --> 02:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
49 reduction in the number of uninsured
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
outpatient visits this has resulted in a
 
02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
significant drop the amount of
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care attributable to those
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
without insurance in state fiscal year
 
02:31:24.110 --> 02:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
2014 the first year of medic of New
 
02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Medicaid expansion program
 
02:31:28.250 --> 02:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals reported 173 million dollars
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
in uncompensated care costs attributable
 
02:31:33.170 --> 02:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
to those uh without insurance as a
 
02:31:34.849 --> 02:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
result of Medicaid expansion those
 
02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care costs have dropped
 
02:31:39.050 --> 02:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
dramatically to 69 million in state
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 a direct reflection of
 
02:31:43.969 --> 02:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
the additional health insurance covered
 
02:31:45.770 --> 02:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
provided by the granite Advantage
 
02:31:48.050 --> 02:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
Healthcare program continuation of this
 
02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
vital program is an important investment
 
02:31:51.530 --> 02:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
in the health of our state and the
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
people it serves and we urge its
 
02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
continued reauthorization we appreciate
 
02:31:57.170 --> 02:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan support that the granted
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%

frisbee Memorial Hospitals
 
02:32:26.929 --> 02:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
in 2022 together our three hospitals and

2600 staff members delivered Health Care
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%

encounters
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the benefits provided by granted
 
02:32:38.270 --> 02:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
Advantage our uncompensated care for our
 
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
three hospitals which totaled over 14
 
02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars was able to be decreased
 
02:32:45.290 --> 02:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
by eight percent from the prior year
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
in large part due to granted advantage
 
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
why is this important to us over the
 
02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
last two years hospitals have weathered
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous challenges and we continue to
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
see uncertainties and Rising costs
 
02:33:00.050 --> 02:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
around Workforce supply chain and
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
capital costs reauthorizing granted
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
Advantage would help create some
 
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
certainty in a very uncertain climate
 
02:33:08.349 --> 02:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
for Health Systems
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
reauthorization is not just important
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
for hospitals but also for the
 
02:33:13.610 --> 02:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
communities we serve there are
 
02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
businesses and providers in our
 
02:33:16.969 --> 02:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
communities who rely on granted
 
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
advantage to continue to serve patients
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
and provide preventative care for those
 
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.130 align:start position:0%
and provide preventative care for those
patients

reauthorization thank you thank you

reauthorization thank you thank you
questions

02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Shapiro
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:46.790 align:start position:0%
taking this question
um

02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
I've read that the New Hampshire fiscal
 
02:33:51.050 --> 02:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
policy Institute has
 
02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
um estimated that
 
02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
3.23 billion dollars has come into the
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
state through Medicaid expansion during
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
the whole time of Medicaid expansion so
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money and
 
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:03.710 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money and
um

02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
for both unreimbursed care what would
 
02:34:09.770 --> 02:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
have been unreimbursed care and other
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of Cascades down the line when
 
02:34:16.370 --> 02:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
we when we talk about tax policy there's
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
always a lot of emphasis on how
 
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
important it is for businesses to know
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
what the policy is going to be going out
 
02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
years and years because of the need to
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
plan and I know that right now there's a
 
02:34:32.090 --> 02:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
debate about whether this should be
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
permanent as this bill says or whether
 
02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
two years or something in between so my
 
02:34:43.250 --> 02:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
question is really how important is
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
um how important is passing Medicaid
 
02:34:49.550 --> 02:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
expansion that is permanent or long-term
 
02:34:52.130 --> 02:34:52.140 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal planning for medical institutions
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'll start um I would say it's very
 
02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
important that we have that level of
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
stability so that we understand what
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
that will look like it's important for
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
hospitals but also think about the small
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
independent provider the small practice
 
02:35:12.290 --> 02:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
um someone providing Behavioral Health
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
Services seeing patients who are covered
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid expansion not knowing
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
whether those patients would continue to
 
02:35:20.750 --> 02:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
be covered through insurance would be a
 
02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
really challenging thing for them to
 
02:35:24.770 --> 02:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
plan to whether they could continue to
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
serve those those patients there are
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
other uh you know issues of importance
 
02:35:30.889 --> 02:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
for for the health plans to be able to
 
02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
understand that they that's going to be
 
02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
a longer term contract I know that there
 
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
will be others who will speak to that
 
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
issue but again we think that that
 
02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's an important piece and the
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
senator Bradley note of the program has
 
02:35:44.809 --> 02:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
certainly stood the test of time and as
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
we all know um any legislator can
 
02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill at any point in time to
 
02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
make a change to a program so we believe
 
02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
removing that sunset provision isn't is
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate thing with the the
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
level of oversight that will continue
 
02:36:01.490 --> 02:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
no I think Steve answered that very
 
02:36:03.370 --> 02:36:03.380 align:start position:0%
eloquently I have nothing further ad
 
02:36:07.490 --> 02:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
02:36:09.530 --> 02:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions okay thank
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:18.650 --> 02:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Henry lippman
 
02:36:19.849 --> 02:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
02:36:19.859 --> 02:36:26.809 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
Services

02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:35.170 --> 02:36:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the record Henry Littman States
 
02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director I'd like to make three
 
02:36:41.809 --> 02:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
points so we make sure I stay within the
 
02:36:44.450 --> 02:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
three minutes the the term of
 
02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
reauthorization is important in terms of
 
02:36:51.410 --> 02:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
getting value for the procurement we're
 
02:36:54.050 --> 02:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
currently due to re-procure the contract
 
02:36:59.090 --> 02:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
during 24 fiscal year and I think it's
 
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:03.140 align:start position:0%
important to have a a term that allows
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
mcos who may be bidding for the contract
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
to have a reasonable expectation that
 
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:11.300 align:start position:0%
their upfront Investments and building
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with the contract that
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
they'll get a return on that and so I
 
02:37:18.650 --> 02:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
think that's one point the second point
 
02:37:23.210 --> 02:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make is sort of to tie to
 
02:37:25.610 --> 02:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
what Senator Bradley was saying earlier
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid expansion as a program is
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
not just good for within the Medicaid
 
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
Program that's been very good for the
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
insurance markets in New Hampshire as as
 
02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
Senator talked about what effectively
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion does for our
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
insurance markets is a population that
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
has maybe a different utilization level
 
02:37:50.690 --> 02:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
than other parts of the market is an out
 
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
of the other risk basis which allows
 
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
better pricing and I think where we see
 
02:37:57.410 --> 02:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
we have a we're number one in the
 
02:37:59.110 --> 02:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
country a number of people covered by
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
employee sponsored insurance and we have
 
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
the lowest Benchmark premium
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
um on the exchange and I think it's you
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
have to look at this is part of I think
 
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
a policy tool not only to help people
 
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
around Medicaid but it's helping
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
everyone in the in the state and finally
 
02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
um on a matter of uh quality and
 
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce we've actually seen during the
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
the period of two before the federal
 
02:38:29.530 --> 02:38:29.540 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency today
 
02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley talked about 70 percent
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid population working
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's higher than pre-pandemic levels
 
02:38:40.610 --> 02:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
and lastly in terms of quality we do
 
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
track a lot of metrics uh about 300 on
 
02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
the program all told them we have a
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
website if you'd like to look at that
 
02:38:50.929 --> 02:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
but I would mention a couple things that
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
generally in Medicaid there are areas
 
02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
where we even outperform the the
 
02:38:58.610 --> 02:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
commercial market in terms of the Care
 
02:39:01.730 --> 02:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
Management that's with the program just
 
02:39:04.849 --> 02:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
one example is control of diabetes and
 
02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
the common
 
02:39:09.610 --> 02:39:09.620 align:start position:0%
H1 AC
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
Dimension that the rates for New
 
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid are higher than in in
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
other parts of the market and also in
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the important Services of
 
02:39:20.809 --> 02:39:20.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up after an emergency room for
 
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
either mental health and sud condition
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
um higher than than the New Hampshire
 
02:39:28.130 --> 02:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
commercial Market with that I'll stop
 
02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
and take any questions thank you very
 
02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:31.550 align:start position:0%
and take any questions thank you very
much

02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions oh yes representative Murphy
 
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is I
 
02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
believe that you have
 
02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken three MCO contracts
 
02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh in the Medicaid Program is that
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct and how long how
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
long does each contract usually
 
02:39:49.849 --> 02:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
negotiate for yeah and the program has
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
been five year terms and how challenging
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
would it be to go to two years or how
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
beneficial as a conversely stated you
 
02:39:59.570 --> 02:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
know would it be to allow this to be a
 
02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
permanent change at house division three
 
02:40:04.490 --> 02:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
I testified the concern I had was with a
 
02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
two-year reauthorization that was talked
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
about there is that it would actually
 
02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
only amount to one year
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
um under the procurement
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was scribbling as
 
02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
fast as I could but I missed your point
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
number three which was about the
 
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
workforce and then I missed the last
 
02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
part of that so in terms of Workforce
 
02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
the 70 number that uh
 
02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley referenced that was in
 
02:40:38.030 --> 02:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
the Kaiser report if you go back and
 
02:40:41.809 --> 02:40:41.819 align:start position:0%
look at 2019 report that actually the
 
02:40:43.130 --> 02:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
number of people are working in the
 
02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid within Medicaid is higher today
 
02:40:47.090 --> 02:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
than it was
 
02:40:49.610 --> 02:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
um before the pandemic okay thank you
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
very much and the second point was
 
02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:53.870 align:start position:0%
regarding the
um

02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
the question MS lippin
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
earlier I asked the question to Senator
 
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
Bradley my concern is that for the last
 
02:41:13.969 --> 02:41:13.979 align:start position:0%
two years it has been sort of an
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
emergency Federal order to protect
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid people from income issues and
 
02:41:20.690 --> 02:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
it could be taken up Medicaid because of
 
02:41:22.610 --> 02:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
that however that's been changeable I
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
think it's May 11th or the next nine
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
months the Department's going to go
 
02:41:28.250 --> 02:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
through that reevaluation process my
 
02:41:30.050 --> 02:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
what impact it's going to have on those
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that may not qualify and
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
then what can the department do to try
 
02:41:38.650 --> 02:41:38.660 align:start position:0%
to help them apply for
 
02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
individual coverage or supplement them
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned for like
 
02:41:46.010 --> 02:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
25 30 000 people that may not qualify
 
02:41:48.770 --> 02:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
what can we do about that
 
02:41:52.250 --> 02:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
so we've been doing a lot and um just in
 
02:41:54.410 --> 02:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
the interest of time here I think let me
 
02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:55.250 align:start position:0%
the interest of time here I think let me
just

02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:41:57.170 --> 02:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
um highlight a few of the sort of the
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
key ones is that an individual that's
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
over income that completes their
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
redetermination we automatically refer
 
02:42:06.889 --> 02:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
them to the federal exchange so that
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
they can be picked up on we went further
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
than that we were the first state in the
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
country to approach socio which is the
 
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
the agency within the federal HHS to be
 
02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
able to actually people who in the past
 
02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
would do nothing about that that their
 
02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
application would just sort of be like a
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
dead letter wouldn't go anywhere and so
 
02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
now we have a mechanism to communicate
 
02:42:33.770 --> 02:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
back so that those individuals can be
 
02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
picked up and offered the opportunity
 
02:42:37.250 --> 02:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's a special enrollment period
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
available to people who lose their
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid they have between now excuse me
 
02:42:46.849 --> 02:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
between April 1st and July of 24 and so
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
we've been working extensively with the
 
02:42:50.809 --> 02:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
states navigate us through the New
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department we've
 
02:42:54.969 --> 02:42:54.979 align:start position:0%
been working extensively with the mcos
 
02:42:57.889 --> 02:42:57.899 align:start position:0%
and they've we've given them their
 
02:42:59.690 --> 02:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
patients list so that they can do
 
02:43:01.730 --> 02:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
Outreach we've worked with Community
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers fqhcs and giving
 
02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
them their patient list to let them know
 
02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
in detail what individuals they're
 
02:43:11.210 --> 02:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
caring for that have a redetermination
 
02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's outstanding one just wants to two
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
statistics quick statistics we never
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
stop like some states processing
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
applications or asking people
 
02:43:21.889 --> 02:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
voluntarily to complete their
 
02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
redetermination we had about 103 000
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
people at the end of March that were
 
02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
protected by the continuous enrollment
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
we'd actually we're concerned about how
 
02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
many people would be affected so we
 
02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
worked for a couple years to get people
 
02:43:38.809 --> 02:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
to do it voluntarily we've got over 32
 
02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
000 people to complete their
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
determination on a voluntary basis
 
02:43:44.330 --> 02:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing the workload so that we
 
02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
can catch give people the attention they
 
02:43:49.370 --> 02:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
deserve and then secondly
 
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh people have let us know over I think
 
02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
3 300 people now maybe 3 500 have let us
 
02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
know that they no longer need Medicaid
 
02:43:59.210 --> 02:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
because they have based on our Outreach
 
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know we're we're uh we're
 
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
doing all we can I think we you know
 
02:44:05.809 --> 02:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
we've come at this we don't want anybody
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
to lose coverage that that qualifies
 
02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and those that can't we're trying to
 
02:44:13.630 --> 02:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
look help them find other options
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want a quick comment I
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
want to say much appreciate your
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
involvement of what you're doing in the
 
02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
department as well going my opinion
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what's probably
 
02:44:25.929 --> 02:44:25.939 align:start position:0%
required I think it's um the human
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
humanistic side of the department that I
 
02:44:30.889 --> 02:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
see which is thank you thank you other
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Coachman
 
02:44:34.849 --> 02:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:44:36.889 --> 02:44:36.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:44:40.090 --> 02:44:40.100 align:start position:0%
um so thinking about the MCO contracts
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that they're
 
02:44:46.190 --> 02:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to you know the the funds
 
02:44:48.410 --> 02:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
that come from the state and federal
 
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
government to pay for the actual care
 
02:44:54.290 --> 02:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's probably a baseline
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
um compensation for the mcos for the
 
02:44:58.849 --> 02:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
um do you know what those are per
 
02:45:04.490 --> 02:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
enrollee per day I don't have an on a
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
per day basis I can give you on a
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
percentage basis and and roughly what I
 
02:45:10.250 --> 02:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
what came out in dollars in the most
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
recent contract but basically um you
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
know when I was in front of governor and
 
02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:16.190 align:start position:0%
know when I was in front of governor and
Council

02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
Council
 
02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
um one of the key things that I'm always
 
02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
facing when I come to Governor council
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
is you know the challenge of how much
 
02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're paying for administration you know
 
02:45:26.450 --> 02:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're currently paying
 
02:45:28.010 --> 02:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
um among the lowest I think in the
 
02:45:29.809 --> 02:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
country with respect to to the
 
02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
administrative costs we're paying
 
02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
between for the administrative component
 
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
depending on the eligibility class
 
02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
between 7.4 and 8.3 percent of the the
 
02:45:43.969 --> 02:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
capitation rate
 
02:45:45.770 --> 02:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
um there's built-in
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
um on top of that we we spend about 90
 
02:45:52.610 --> 02:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
percent of the dollars our Medical Care
 
02:45:54.530 --> 02:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
um two percent is for the premium tax
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and one and a half percent is the
 
02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
built-in Actuarial margin into the into
 
02:46:01.550 --> 02:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
the program and it's it's very lean and
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
and uh we I think that we've spent
 
02:46:06.889 --> 02:46:06.899 align:start position:0%
um with the enrollment at in this
 
02:46:08.809 --> 02:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
current uh amendment that we're
 
02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
operating under we're about a quarter of
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
a million individuals today
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
um in total in the program not just
 
02:46:16.969 --> 02:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
expansion but the entire program it was
 
02:46:18.889 --> 02:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
about 105 million dollars in an
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
out of a 1.3 billion plus contract
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions okay thank you
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Senator Cindy
 
02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
and Senator you put down five minutes if
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
you can keep it to three I'd appreciate
 
02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you yeah thank you Mr
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Cindy Rosenwald from
 
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
Senate District 13. I'm here to speak in
 
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
strong supportive Senate bill 263. this
 
02:47:09.770 --> 02:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
program not only benefits the health of
 
02:47:11.690 --> 02:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of New Hampshire
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
residents it's also a very significant
 
02:47:17.929 --> 02:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
pro-business program because a healthy
 
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
working age population is an employable
 
02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:22.570 align:start position:0%
working age population is an employable
population

02:47:22.570 --> 02:47:22.580 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:47:27.170 --> 02:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
since its Inception in 2014 Medicaid
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
expansion has been a Lifeline for
 
02:47:32.929 --> 02:47:32.939 align:start position:0%
hospitals particularly the small rural
 
02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
ones reducing uncompensated care as
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley said
 
02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care leads to higher
 
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
premiums for people who have private
 
02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:45.349 align:start position:0%
premiums for people who have private
insurance

02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
and because the federal government funds
 
02:47:52.370 --> 02:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
almost all of it Medicaid expansion is a
 
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
significant economic driver last year
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
alone it represented a 500 million
 
02:48:01.929 --> 02:48:01.939 align:start position:0%
dollar investment in our state's economy
 
02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
the program has several built-in
 
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
safeguards for taxpayers Senator Bradley
 
02:48:13.309 --> 02:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
spoke of removing a perspective repeal
 
02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
as making the the program permanent
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking that's not the case as
 
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court
 
02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
um issued an opinion
 
02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years ago now as a waiver
 
02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
program is completely voluntary
 
02:48:38.929 --> 02:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
while no state has stopped Medicaid
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
expansion all of them could and New
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could stop Medicaid expansion
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
by notifying CMS that we wanted to
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
winding down the waiver it would
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
probably take six or nine months but
 
02:48:56.399 --> 02:48:58.130 align:start position:0%
probably take six or nine months but
there's

02:48:58.130 --> 02:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
there's not really permanency in it
 
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
because it's a voluntary program and
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's a waiver program
 
02:49:08.809 --> 02:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
I've been honored to work with Senator
 
02:49:08.819 --> 02:49:10.070 align:start position:0%
I've been honored to work with Senator
Bradley

02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
Bradley
 
02:49:13.370 --> 02:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
on this program since its Inception in
 
02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:15.130 align:start position:0%
on this program since its Inception in
2014

02:49:15.130 --> 02:49:15.140 align:start position:0%
2014
 
02:49:17.690 --> 02:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
actually we started working on probably
 
02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
in 2012.
 
02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
granted advantages and extremely
 
02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
successful program and I think we need
 
02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
to reauthorize it thank you I'm happy to
 
02:49:29.270 --> 02:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator questions
 
02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
being here Senator
 
02:49:38.929 --> 02:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
um I want to know your opinion what do
 
02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
you make of the recent statement the
 
02:49:43.969 --> 02:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
recommendations released by the
 
02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
Congressional budget office
 
02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
that due to the federal deficit
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the immense amount of debt
 
02:49:55.730 --> 02:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with federally that
 
02:49:58.030 --> 02:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
they recommend that the states
 
02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
and the federal government decrease
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrollment and increase the
 
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
state portion of funding for Medicaid
 
02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
and how does that impact the future of
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation well in terms of this
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
program then 90 Federal contribution is
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
not by regulation it is in federal
 
02:50:26.330 --> 02:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
statute it can only be changed by an act
 
02:50:28.370 --> 02:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
of Congress
 
02:50:31.010 --> 02:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
and let me just say that the federal
 
02:50:35.330 --> 02:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
government has never ever not made good
 
02:50:38.210 --> 02:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
on its promises for paying their
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of Medicaid costs in fact
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
several times since I've been in the
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
legislature over the past nine and a
 
02:50:50.650 --> 02:50:50.660 align:start position:0%
half terms the federal government has
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
increased its proportion of matching
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
funds either for children for the last
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
few years for
 
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
all of Medicaid except for a Medicaid
 
02:51:09.050 --> 02:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
expansion so I really don't see
 
02:51:13.809 --> 02:51:13.819 align:start position:0%
any change in the federal matching
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
percentage for this program
 
02:51:19.550 --> 02:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:51:20.929 --> 02:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:51:23.270 --> 02:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
um well I'm concerned when you what do
 
02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
you make of the effect that this will
 
02:51:27.290 --> 02:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
have on on national debt and inflation
 
02:51:29.090 --> 02:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
because the federal government is
 
02:51:32.330 --> 02:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
picking up more of the tab and with the
 
02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
increase in spending we're printing more
 
02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
money we have a higher deficit now than
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
we ever have you know Nationwide this is
 
02:51:41.270 --> 02:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
an issue and it impacts us here in the
 
02:51:44.290 --> 02:51:44.300 align:start position:0%
granite state do you have any
 
02:51:46.849 --> 02:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
trepidation about that
 
02:51:49.849 --> 02:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm not an
 
02:51:53.690 --> 02:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
economist but I think with
 
02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:54.710 align:start position:0%
economist but I think with
um

02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
lots of other changes in the world and
 
02:52:02.269 --> 02:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
in federal law over the last four or
 
02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
five years there are many other things
 
02:52:08.090 --> 02:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
that have contributed to federal debt
 
02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
rather than Medicaid expansion in the
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
like 40 states that have done it
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:52:21.349 --> 02:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions
 
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative Weber uh
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%

Doug McNutt I'm a member of the state
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging I serve with
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber on that Commission
 
02:53:33.170 --> 02:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
in the past I've worked for AARP and I
 
02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
also work for the Department of Health
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and division of
 
02:53:40.090 --> 02:53:40.100 align:start position:0%
elderly Adult Services I come here today
 
02:53:42.110 --> 02:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
representing the state Commission on
 
02:53:44.349 --> 02:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
Aging who is in support of this bill
 
02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
I've passed out written testimony and I
 
02:53:49.550 --> 02:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
want to just talk about a couple of
 
02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
things that probably
 
02:53:52.929 --> 02:53:52.939 align:start position:0%
um some of the other
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
testifiers won't be mentioning I'm going
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
to focus on the category of people that
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
are 56 to 64 that are taking advantage
 
02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid
 
02:54:06.769 --> 02:54:06.779 align:start position:0%
expansion that's a population for home
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
health insurance is very expensive they
 
02:54:12.349 --> 02:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
are people who oftentimes have lost jobs
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
and at that age it's very difficult to
 
02:54:17.570 --> 02:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
get the next job this program is a
 
02:54:19.929 --> 02:54:19.939 align:start position:0%
lifesaver for those people in terms of
 
02:54:22.190 --> 02:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
keeping them healthy so that they can
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
and continue to work and take on that
 
02:54:28.130 --> 02:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
next job at this point and I the figures
 
02:54:31.370 --> 02:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
from last year indicate about 15 percent
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
of the people on Medicaid expansion are
 
02:54:35.809 --> 02:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
from that age group and they are
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
particularly vulnerable group of people
 
02:54:40.610 --> 02:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
and this program is critical for them
 
02:54:42.170 --> 02:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to mention
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
briefly is that this is also helpful for
 
02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:46.570 align:start position:0%
briefly is that this is also helpful for
caregivers

02:54:46.570 --> 02:54:46.580 align:start position:0%
caregivers
 
02:54:49.550 --> 02:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of taking care of people who
 
02:54:50.830 --> 02:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
are in that age bracket and
 
02:54:53.870 --> 02:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
significantly older this helps the
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
workforce situation and the people who
 
02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
are low wage are able to get health
 
02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
insurance and when they need it and it
 
02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
is also helpful in terms of that regard
 
02:55:06.349 --> 02:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
so those are the two principal things
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to focus on and I'd be
 
02:55:10.490 --> 02:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:11.349 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
have

02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:55:16.429 --> 02:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr McNutt
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Greg Moore
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.010 --> 02:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
again sir you have three minutes
 
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:55:37.370 --> 02:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
committee I'll make this as brief as
 
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
possible uh there's two issues as a
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
sponsoring side relative to this bill
 
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
one is to the merits of Medicaid
 
02:55:46.130 --> 02:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
expansion and the second subsidiary
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
issue is uh what time duration if there
 
02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
should be an expansion should it last
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
those are the two fundamental issues
 
02:55:53.570 --> 02:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
here I'll address both in the first
 
02:55:55.490 --> 02:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
instance in the first instance and by
 
02:55:56.990 --> 02:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
the way uh this is actually the fifth
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
time we've done Medicaid expansion
 
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's 2013 2014 2016 2018 and now and
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh I also want to point one thing out
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
which is the uh the Senator Senator how
 
02:56:10.130 --> 02:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
the speakers have mentioned a drop in in
 
02:56:12.410 --> 02:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
health insurance costs
 
02:56:14.510 --> 02:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
I will say that I monitor this pretty
 
02:56:16.610 --> 02:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
closely and the correlation to that
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
appears to be with an insurance waiver
 
02:56:20.510 --> 02:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Insurance filed
 
02:56:22.610 --> 02:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
in 2018 relative to setting up a
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide reinsurance pool and that that
 
02:56:26.750 --> 02:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
correlates much more closely with the
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
drop in health insurance costs than the
 
02:56:32.750 --> 02:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
2014 expansion of Medicaid but America's
 
02:56:35.570 --> 02:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
Prosperity uh poses this legislation and
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
it does so for a couple of reasons first
 
02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
and foremost first and foremost as this
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned uh there is concern
 
02:56:45.050 --> 02:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
about the impact of a welfare or
 
02:56:46.849 --> 02:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
benefits Cliff we know this is a big
 
02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
issue it's an issue that's been
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in both left and right and I
 
02:56:51.290 --> 02:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
know the department issued a report on
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
this very issue last week oddly enough
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
they seem to they seem to tackle every
 
02:56:57.769 --> 02:56:57.779 align:start position:0%
means tested welfare program in the
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
state except for Medicaid which I find
 
02:57:02.330 --> 02:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of an outlier but uh
 
02:57:04.010 --> 02:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's not so much whether people work or
 
02:57:05.809 --> 02:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
not work as a sponsor said the question
 
02:57:08.929 --> 02:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
is whether people will work further take
 
02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
a job that pays a little more seek out
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
more hours that's really the challenge
 
02:57:16.429 --> 02:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
is the benefit Cliffs impact that aspect
 
02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
not whether the binary decision as to
 
02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
what whether or not to work
 
02:57:22.010 --> 02:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
so we think that's an important factor
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
for the for the committee to consider
 
02:57:25.849 --> 02:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
the second factor for the committee to
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
consider is the impact of all the
 
02:57:29.809 --> 02:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
induced demand they're putting hundreds
 
02:57:31.849 --> 02:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars of new money into
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
the HealthCare Marketplace makes
 
02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
now we do know it reduces uncompensated
 
02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
care there's no question that it reduces
 
02:57:39.710 --> 02:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care but we're spending
 
02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
500 million dollars a year on Medicaid
 
02:57:43.849 --> 02:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
expansion and the reduction in
 
02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
uncompensated cares is well less than
 
02:57:48.110 --> 02:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
that the the other money represents an
 
02:57:50.929 --> 02:57:50.939 align:start position:0%
uh induced demand that is uh causing
 
02:57:52.969 --> 02:57:52.979 align:start position:0%
more utilization that utilization has
 
02:57:55.490 --> 02:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
put a strain on our on our health care
 
02:57:57.469 --> 02:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we have now have provider
 
02:57:59.150 --> 02:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
shortages across the state when I worked
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
at the department provider shortages
 
02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
were something that were fairly rare
 
02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes within unique fields and and
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
particularly in the Northern parts of
 
02:58:07.730 --> 02:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
the state now we see them widespread
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
across the state and this induced demand
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
does have an impact on that the second
 
02:58:15.290 --> 02:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
issue relative to the time frame uh I as
 
02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
to whether or not this should be
 
02:58:17.809 --> 02:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
permanent or as the house finance
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee recommended a more temporary
 
02:58:22.429 --> 02:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
expansion of Medicaid and what I was
 
02:58:24.410 --> 02:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
what I would say to that is I do expect
 
02:58:26.210 --> 02:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
there will be Federal action I know this
 
02:58:28.849 --> 02:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
because a former boss of mine that
 
02:58:31.010 --> 02:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative McKay knows well and our
 
02:58:32.330 --> 02:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
Pacific McDonald knows well has been
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
talking with members of Congress and
 
02:58:36.410 --> 02:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
there is an effort a foot to look for
 
02:58:39.290 --> 02:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
ways to try to bring reforms to it a lot
 
02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
of those reforms look like some of the
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
reforms that represent McKay would
 
02:58:45.050 --> 02:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
remember from TANF which is such as uh
 
02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
allow allowing for the provision of work
 
02:58:48.110 --> 02:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
requirement New Hampshire does have a
 
02:58:49.309 --> 02:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
work requirement law but it's been
 
02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
disallowed by the federal courts in
 
02:58:52.849 --> 02:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
other words changing the federal law to
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
allow work requirements and potentially
 
02:58:56.570 --> 02:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
a lifetime benefit cap similar to what's
 
02:58:59.690 --> 02:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
what's been in place with TANF so for
 
02:59:01.010 --> 02:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
those reasons we think it's important
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
for us to consistently refresh and look
 
02:59:04.849 --> 02:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
back at this program and to determine
 
02:59:06.530 --> 02:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
and determine whether we need to make
 
02:59:09.050 --> 02:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
adaptations as we did with the TANF
 
02:59:10.969 --> 02:59:10.979 align:start position:0%
program tanfree authorization back in
 
02:59:15.290 --> 02:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
2006 and Justice TANF is reauthorized we
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
should be doing the same with with uh
 
02:59:19.610 --> 02:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid expansion as well and
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
because I do expect there will be
 
02:59:22.490 --> 02:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
Federal action at some point because
 
02:59:24.290 --> 02:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's not wrapping up please absolutely
 
02:59:26.570 --> 02:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll leave it there and
 
02:59:27.769 --> 02:59:27.779 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions from
 
02:59:30.170 --> 02:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you any questions
 
02:59:33.410 --> 02:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
from Mr Moore representative Shapiro
 
02:59:35.090 --> 02:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:59:37.070 --> 02:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question you talked about
 
02:59:37.080 --> 02:59:38.090 align:start position:0%
taking the question you talked about
um

02:59:38.090 --> 02:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
that you seem to be advocating for a
 
02:59:42.889 --> 02:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
shorter term reauthorization because
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
there might be changes coming along and
 
02:59:47.330 --> 02:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
we should be able to be nimble to adjust
 
02:59:49.250 --> 02:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
to those changes
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh we we opposed the
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
program and it's in totality however
 
02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
what I was saying is that the house
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee that with the budget
 
02:59:59.090 --> 02:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
you'll be voting on on Thursday right um
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
has a a shorter duration a two-year
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
extension uh for Medicaid expansion
 
03:00:04.730 --> 03:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
relative to this legislation I was
 
03:00:06.050 --> 03:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
comparing and contrasting to two
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
approaches follow up follow up well
 
03:00:10.670 --> 03:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that if this is made
 
03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:11.809 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that if this is made
permanent

03:00:11.809 --> 03:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
um if this bill is the bill that
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
predominates and it's made permanent
 
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
um couldn't changes be made in any case
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
just by introducing the legislation
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a prospect but uh if
 
03:00:26.330 --> 03:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
you look at the this would be the third
 
03:00:29.650 --> 03:00:29.660 align:start position:0%
reauthorization so 2016 2018 and now
 
03:00:33.410 --> 03:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
2023. uh every time that there have been
 
03:00:34.969 --> 03:00:34.979 align:start position:0%
that this has been reauthorized there
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
have been major changes to the program
 
03:00:38.330 --> 03:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
so it creates a consistent inflection
 
03:00:39.950 --> 03:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
point for the legislature to look to
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
take action so we think that we think
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's a healthy approach
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:48.290 --> 03:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:00:50.450 --> 03:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
say no other questions thank you thank
 
03:00:50.460 --> 03:00:56.150 align:start position:0%
say no other questions thank you thank
you

03:00:56.150 --> 03:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:58.370 --> 03:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is former
 
03:01:06.349 --> 03:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is Tom
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
Sherman I'm a physician in Exeter and a
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
former State Rep and state senator and
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's I always feel like I'm coming home
 
03:01:22.969 --> 03:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
when I come back to health and human
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
services and elderly Affairs I see my
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
former Vice chair and my former chair
 
03:01:30.170 --> 03:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it's just great to be here with you
 
03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:31.790 align:start position:0%
and it's just great to be here with you
all

03:01:31.790 --> 03:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:01:34.370 --> 03:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
um what I'm first of all my background
 
03:01:36.170 --> 03:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid expansion is that I was on
 
03:01:39.769 --> 03:01:39.779 align:start position:0%
the original commission that created the
 
03:01:41.630 --> 03:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
bipartisan proposal for Medicaid
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
expansion that included as
 
03:01:45.769 --> 03:01:45.779 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman alluded to the
 
03:01:48.650 --> 03:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
circuit breakers that that's what we
 
03:01:51.410 --> 03:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
call them the taxpayer protections that
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
are in the Bill currently
 
03:01:56.269 --> 03:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
and that also anticipated the need to
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
have expiration dates or reauthorization
 
03:02:01.429 --> 03:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
dates and one of the circuit breakers
 
03:02:04.610 --> 03:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
just to address representative Kushner
 
03:02:08.510 --> 03:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
cushman's earlier question was that the
 
03:02:10.849 --> 03:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
program would automatically go into a
 
03:02:13.250 --> 03:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
reauthorization if the federal component
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
dropped below 90 percent so I think that
 
03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
was one of the reassurances that we had
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
and continue to have whether or not this
 
03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
is made permanent that circuit breaker
 
03:02:28.610 --> 03:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.690 --> 03:02:31.700 align:start position:0%
focus on today very quickly is
 
03:02:35.570 --> 03:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
the human side it's also the fiscal side
 
03:02:38.290 --> 03:02:38.300 align:start position:0%
when I was practicing
 
03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
before Medicaid expansion two patients
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
really stood out to me one of them had
 
03:02:46.969 --> 03:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
ulcerative colitis it was actually very
 
03:02:49.450 --> 03:02:49.460 align:start position:0%
easily treated with an oral medication
 
03:02:52.969 --> 03:02:52.979 align:start position:0%
that he couldn't afford and as a result
 
03:02:54.769 --> 03:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
of not being able to afford it he was
 
03:02:56.809 --> 03:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
bouncing in the hospital in and out of
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
the hospital about every six weeks
 
03:03:02.990 --> 03:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
he lost his job he lost his home his
 
03:03:05.210 --> 03:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
family was dependent completely on
 
03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
public assistance
 
03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
but with Medicaid expansion having seen
 
03:03:12.769 --> 03:03:12.779 align:start position:0%
the before and after as his provider
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
not only did he recover his job
 
03:03:19.250 --> 03:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
and his health but his home and the
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
interesting part to this is that
 
03:03:25.010 --> 03:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
he went off Public Assistance went off
 
03:03:27.950 --> 03:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and was able to be fully
 
03:03:30.110 --> 03:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient once he got his health
 
03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:31.429 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient once he got his health
back

03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:03:34.610 --> 03:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
the second one was more poignant for me
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
it was a woman who not only lost her job
 
03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
her home
 
03:03:40.870 --> 03:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
but also her family
 
03:03:45.010 --> 03:03:45.020 align:start position:0%
she was homeless and we took everybody
 
03:03:48.830 --> 03:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
at core gastroenterology and she walked
 
03:03:51.650 --> 03:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
in with multiple medical problems only
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
one of which was in my specialty
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
but through Medicaid expansion and
 
03:04:01.969 --> 03:04:01.979 align:start position:0%
getting her that coverage with the full
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
complement of 10 essential services
 
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
not only did she recover her health
 
03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
after Medicaid expansion but she also
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
recovered her home and eventually her
 
03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:17.389 align:start position:0%
recovered her home and eventually her
family

03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
the point here is that real people these
 
03:04:21.530 --> 03:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
are Granite Staters these are our
 
03:04:24.410 --> 03:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
neighbors our families
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
these aren't people as as rep as a
 
03:04:31.490 --> 03:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
director Lipman pointed out 70 percent
 
03:04:33.050 --> 03:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
are working
 
03:04:35.389 --> 03:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
these are people who are working they
 
03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:39.420 align:start position:0%

03:05:08.210 --> 03:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
President of Cushman thank you Mr
 
03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:05:09.779 --> 03:05:10.610 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
um it's a simple one uh do you know what
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
the work requirement is exactly is there
 
03:05:19.250 --> 03:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
an hour a number of hours per week that
 
03:05:23.330 --> 03:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
is required of the enrollees it's my
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that there is no work
 
03:05:27.849 --> 03:05:27.859 align:start position:0%
requirement currently because the
 
03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
federal courts actually struck down the
 
03:05:32.570 --> 03:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
work requirements in other states even
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
though we passed a work requirement it
 
03:05:37.370 --> 03:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
couldn't be implemented because of
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal that's my understanding you can
 
03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
check that I'm sure representative I'm
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
sorry director Lipman would know the
 
03:05:46.610 --> 03:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
03:05:49.250 --> 03:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:05:51.290 --> 03:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'm saying none thank you oh I'm sorry
 
03:05:54.530 --> 03:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:57.170 --> 03:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
so it would be your would it be your
 
03:05:59.150 --> 03:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that we are succeeding and
 
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
returning people to the workforce
 
03:06:02.809 --> 03:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that the work
 
03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
requirement is not currently being
 
03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
enforced absolutely and you know when
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
you look at the income levels that allow
 
03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
you to qualify for Medicaid expansion
 
03:06:16.370 --> 03:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
then think about trying to live
 
03:06:19.130 --> 03:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
at that income and also manage your own
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
health care
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
costs it's it's daunting
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
but all of my patients who have come in
 
03:06:31.250 --> 03:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid expansion have gotten the
 
03:06:33.910 --> 03:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
exact same care as commercial carriers
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
patients covered by commercial carriers
 
03:06:39.050 --> 03:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
they have been working and one other
 
03:06:41.389 --> 03:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
point is that I I'm sure you know of the
 
03:06:43.250 --> 03:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
Oregon study that was done through
 
03:06:43.260 --> 03:06:44.450 align:start position:0%
Oregon study that was done through
Harvard

03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
Harvard
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
that study showed that one of the first
 
03:06:49.370 --> 03:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
benefits is that economic stability that
 
03:06:52.010 --> 03:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
allows people to go back to work
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that's really important we
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of Health Care
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
bills it breaks people's home budget
 
03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:00.889 align:start position:0%
bills it breaks people's home budget
completely

03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
completely
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
so having this as a as a tool it doesn't
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
keep people off work it actually gets
 
03:07:10.969 --> 03:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
them back to work and off of Public
 
03:07:14.750 --> 03:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
Assistance and that is has been my
 
03:07:17.230 --> 03:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
clinical experience in my own practice
 
03:07:19.010 --> 03:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and welcome back thank you it's great to
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%

pretty strategies but here today
 
03:08:10.610 --> 03:08:10.620 align:start position:0%

of Commerce Wendy Hunter our president
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
and CEO had very much hope to be here to
 
03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
testify because this bill is a number
 
03:08:21.889 --> 03:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
one priority for the national Chamber of
 
03:08:24.050 --> 03:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
Commerce but she's winging her way home
 
03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
from Greece as we speak so that
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
took priority uh the greater Nashua
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce represents over 400
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%

every sector manufacturing Hospitality
 
03:08:44.090 --> 03:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
health care and and this is a very
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
important business related Bill you'll
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about the health uh
 
03:08:51.230 --> 03:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
improvements that have come through
 
03:08:54.170 --> 03:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion I'm here just to talk
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
about why it's so important to the
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
businesses and we know that we've heard
 
03:09:01.610 --> 03:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
over and over again that we're lacking
 
03:09:05.290 --> 03:09:05.300 align:start position:0%
in many instances of work ready
 
03:09:09.410 --> 03:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce a healthy Workforce ready
 
03:09:09.420 --> 03:09:10.670 align:start position:0%
Workforce a healthy Workforce ready
um

03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:12.769 --> 03:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
lack of insurance is the biggest
 
03:09:15.769 --> 03:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
deterrent to both preventative and
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
necessary particularly for chronic
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
health conditions Health Care
 
03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
greater Nashua has two major Hospital
 
03:09:25.389 --> 03:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
Systems we have Home Care
 
03:09:28.250 --> 03:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers substance abuse
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
providers all of these are major
 
03:09:34.130 --> 03:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
Employers in the greater Nashua area
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
without Medicaid expansion these
 
03:09:41.330 --> 03:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
employers lose significant funding and
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
the members of those that are uninsured
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
as you've heard repeatedly will rise
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically and you've heard that the
 
03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
data on uncompensated care costs will
 
03:09:56.389 --> 03:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
rise and those costs are then passed on
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
to the private insurance contracts and
 
03:10:01.010 --> 03:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
then to the employer who offers health
 
03:10:03.950 --> 03:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
insurance and then to the employee in
 
03:10:06.769 --> 03:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
the form of higher premiums that they
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
get from their their work environment
 
03:10:11.809 --> 03:10:11.819 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley has referred to this as
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
a hidden tax and he's absolutely correct
 
03:10:17.030 --> 03:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what this is cost
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
shifting is a hidden tax
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
and finally again as you've heard and
 
03:10:25.610 --> 03:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
we'll hear repeatedly Senate Bill 263
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
calls for permanent reauthorization we
 
03:10:30.590 --> 03:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
know that what our businesses want and
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
ask consistently from our government is
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
stability and predictability
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
to limit authorization to two years or
 
03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
four years or six years threatens that
 
03:10:45.889 --> 03:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
predictability so on behalf of the
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
strong business community of the SEC
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
State's second largest city and all of
 
03:10:53.630 --> 03:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
its surrounds we ask that you find
 
03:10:57.769 --> 03:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 263 permanently authorizing
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion
 
03:11:01.570 --> 03:11:01.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
and you could follow the sentence
 
03:11:08.170 --> 03:11:08.180 align:start position:0%
send its way and do it unanimously
 
03:11:11.330 --> 03:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for your time and for
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%

and we'll take any questions that you
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%

I serve as the CEO at Emma skate health

this from the perspective of a patient
 
03:15:36.290 --> 03:15:36.300 align:start position:0%

03:16:06.010 --> 03:16:06.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the last five years we've seen a 12
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
percent increase in patients and 116
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%

patients seeking sud services
 
03:16:18.889 --> 03:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
and we know that the members of our
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
community and the communities that you
 
03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
represent have better access to health
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
care services that they desperately need
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
when they have insurance and I'd like to
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that through a patient care
 
03:16:31.790 --> 03:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
story I always think that's the most
 
03:16:33.950 --> 03:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
impactful way to think about a program
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
such as this this is a story that our
 
03:16:38.929 --> 03:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
associate medical director of Family
 
03:16:42.050 --> 03:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
Practice shared with our team and I
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
thought it was really poignant and I
 
03:16:45.530 --> 03:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
thought it would make sense to share
 
03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
with you she had a patient that was in
 
03:16:50.330 --> 03:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
his mid-50s that she had been providing
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
health care for for over 15 years
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
construction worker great guy but
 
03:16:58.370 --> 03:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
suffered with diabetes and Sugar's
 
03:17:00.110 --> 03:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
constantly out of control constantly out
 
03:17:01.730 --> 03:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
of control couldn't do anything to kind
 
03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
of get them established and after the
 
03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
implementation of the Granite State
 
03:17:09.650 --> 03:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
advantage and Medicaid expansion in New
 
03:17:12.769 --> 03:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire suddenly his number started to
 
03:17:15.230 --> 03:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
come down and come down and she said all
 
03:17:17.150 --> 03:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
right I gotta ask I don't know what we
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
did differently this time but suddenly
 
03:17:22.250 --> 03:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's working and he said because I can
 
03:17:25.610 --> 03:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
afford my medication I can afford my
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
test strips I'm testing regularly I'm
 
03:17:30.710 --> 03:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
taking the medication as you prescribe
 
03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm not cutting my doses suddenly
 
03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
he's doing it excellently his sugar is
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
controlled and this has really enabled
 
03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
him that ability to stabilize his health
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
and stay out of the hospital and not
 
03:17:47.570 --> 03:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
lose a limb not lose his eyesight so
 
03:17:50.510 --> 03:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
you can see that that impact for
 
03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
managing chronic disease and so many
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
individuals face that and the older we
 
03:17:57.170 --> 03:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
get the more of those we Face I'll
 
03:17:59.809 --> 03:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
include myself in that group it's a
 
03:18:02.450 --> 03:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
really critical mechanism and she often
 
03:18:04.130 --> 03:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
says you know if it weren't for Medicaid
 
03:18:07.010 --> 03:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
expansion so many of my patients I would
 
03:18:08.990 --> 03:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
not be able to help them effectively
 
03:18:11.330 --> 03:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
manage their care because when I come to
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
the doctor I'm probably going to need a
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
test or I'm probably going to need a
 
03:18:17.809 --> 03:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
medicine and how am I going to be able
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
to afford that if I don't have a
 
03:18:21.769 --> 03:18:21.779 align:start position:0%
mechanism and people make horrible
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
horrible choices about oh can I afford
 
03:18:27.290 --> 03:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
my rent or can I pay my gas or can I buy
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
this medicine that I so desperately need
 
03:18:31.730 --> 03:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
we can start wrapping up please that was
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%

03:18:36.769 --> 03:18:36.779 align:start position:0%

want to talk to you about Farnum in
 
03:19:26.450 --> 03:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
particular it's one of 14 programs and
 
03:19:29.690 --> 03:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
services that Easter Seals manages
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
um just a note about Easter Seals in New
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're in the top five largest
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
Affiliates of Easter Seals in the

individuals across the granite in Green
 
03:19:42.889 --> 03:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
Mountain States and we're the 12th
 
03:19:45.950 --> 03:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
largest employer in New Hampshire
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
so Farnam as you may know is a carf
 
03:19:50.210 --> 03:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
accredited substance misuse Treatment
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
Facility in Manchester we do inpatient
 
03:19:54.290 --> 03:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
and outpatient treatment at two
 
03:19:56.929 --> 03:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
locations Our Queen City app location is
 
03:19:59.630 --> 03:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
a 24 by 7 residential treatment facility
 
03:20:01.969 --> 03:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
and Farnam has been doing substance use
 
03:20:05.210 --> 03:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
treatment for over 35 years
 
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
Burnham services are evidence-based
 
03:20:09.290 --> 03:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
which is something critical in this
 
03:20:09.300 --> 03:20:10.190 align:start position:0%
which is something critical in this
field

03:20:10.190 --> 03:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
field
 
03:20:12.230 --> 03:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
our staff just completed training at
 
03:20:14.450 --> 03:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
Hazelton Betty Ford foundation so that
 
03:20:16.730 --> 03:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
they can do co-occurring treatment it's
 
03:20:18.769 --> 03:20:18.779 align:start position:0%
estimated that 80 percent of people in
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment also have
 
03:20:23.809 --> 03:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
mental illness this will position Farnum
 
03:20:25.730 --> 03:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
well to be able to manage the whole
 
03:20:27.950 --> 03:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
person instead of bisecting between
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
mental illness and substance misuse I
 
03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
see representative McKay nodding
 
03:20:32.340 --> 03:20:36.530 align:start position:0%
see representative McKay nodding
knowingly

03:20:36.530 --> 03:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:38.929 --> 03:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
just this last weekend
 
03:20:38.939 --> 03:20:41.450 align:start position:0%
just this last weekend
um

03:20:41.450 --> 03:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
our payer mix in detox was 78 Medicaid
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
and in residential treatment it was 89
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and this is typical at Freedom
 
03:20:53.809 --> 03:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
our next largest payer is the Bureau of
 
03:20:55.969 --> 03:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol services with whom we
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
have a contract and it reimburses less
 
03:21:00.050 --> 03:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
than Medicaid does
 
03:21:02.450 --> 03:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
asking why Farnham served so many people
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid as akin to asking what came
 
03:21:07.610 --> 03:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
first the chicken or the egg
 
03:21:09.170 --> 03:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
focusing on the Medicaid population
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
allows us to sub-specialize on the
 
03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
social determinants of Health that
 
03:21:16.010 --> 03:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
underpin Medicaid eligibility
 
03:21:17.690 --> 03:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
this is the space that we proudly
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of our
 
03:21:25.309 --> 03:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
patients benefit from the granted
 
03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program so recall 87 and 89
 
03:21:29.929 --> 03:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
percent of our census was Medicaid the
 
03:21:32.090 --> 03:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
majority of those are granted advantage
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and one need not be the chair of house
 
03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
finance to understand that if the
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage goes away Farnham
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
becomes extremely precarious
 
03:21:42.530 --> 03:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
permanent reauthorization is
 
03:21:44.750 --> 03:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this bill is needed for
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
safety net provides providers like
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
Farnham who do not have the ability to
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
do robust cross-subsidization across
 
03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:51.889 align:start position:0%
do robust cross-subsidization across
payers

03:21:51.889 --> 03:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
payers
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
our ability to plan for the future for
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
sustainability requires that we know
 
03:21:58.130 --> 03:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
that our primary source of funding is
 
03:21:58.140 --> 03:22:00.010 align:start position:0%
that our primary source of funding is
intact

03:22:00.010 --> 03:22:00.020 align:start position:0%
intact
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
in the absence of Farnam who will
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
welcome 300 3000 or more low-income
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
individuals for treatment for which they
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
cannot pay each year
 
03:22:10.190 --> 03:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
we all know that those folks will go
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
without necessary care
 
03:22:13.370 --> 03:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
they will miss the opportunity to get
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
back on their feet return to family and
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
work stronger and healthier
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
National estimates are that 110 000
 
03:22:24.190 --> 03:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
individuals died last year of overdoses
 
03:22:26.809 --> 03:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
this does not include deaths due to
 
03:22:28.969 --> 03:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts of addiction which
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
are what my father succumbed to last
 
03:22:33.170 --> 03:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
summer at age 70 and my sister-in-law
 
03:22:35.450 --> 03:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
succumbed to last November at age 55.
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
you could please stop wrapping up
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
my sister-in-law lived in Florida while
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
she was fighting cancer they don't have
 
03:22:44.090 --> 03:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid expansion she sold her home
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
before going to hospice in order to pay

never heard of the plan post Awards I
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
lost my insurance and had to choose
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
between getting medical care that I
 
03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
needed or accruing medical debt since I
 
03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
was a caretaker still to my parents I
 
03:23:51.889 --> 03:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
applied for assistance and the granted
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage was the only program that I
 
03:23:56.330 --> 03:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
could qualify for due to my age plus not
 
03:23:59.630 --> 03:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
being labeled disabled through SSI
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
with the grand Advantage Program I don't
 
03:24:05.269 --> 03:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
have to choose between care slash debt I
 
03:24:07.130 --> 03:24:07.140 align:start position:0%

03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%

affected by this
 
03:24:23.389 --> 03:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
proposal to make it permanent I wouldn't
 
03:24:25.490 --> 03:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
be able to afford the treatment for my
 
03:24:28.250 --> 03:24:28.260 align:start position:0%

I I wouldn't have been able to go to
 
03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
Boston for treatments and then get
 
03:24:43.490 --> 03:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for mileage that Medicaid
 
03:24:46.130 --> 03:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
does right now I get Vision treatment

anxiety ADHD and to be able to go to
 
03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:01.250 align:start position:0%
anxiety ADHD and to be able to go to
work

03:25:01.250 --> 03:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
at my own pace as a member of the
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
Seacoast Pathways a clubhouse they are
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
mental health non-profit that helps
 
03:25:11.690 --> 03:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
people get back to work
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
with my conditions I can't focus on
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
getting healthier as well as getting
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
back to work at the same time so taking
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
care of my health because of the great
 
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
Innovations program has helped me be
 
03:25:25.190 --> 03:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
able to work part-time I doordash
 
03:25:27.429 --> 03:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
because my parents recently passed away
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
so this helps me get back to work and to
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
be able to have the services I need and
 
03:25:36.349 --> 03:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
the support for
 
03:25:38.690 --> 03:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
me to have a healthier life for the rest
 
03:25:41.690 --> 03:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
of my life because I'm only 39.
 
03:25:41.700 --> 03:25:43.130 align:start position:0%
of my life because I'm only 39.
so

03:25:43.130 --> 03:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
I propose that you say yes to keeping
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
this program and to keep it permanent so
 
03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have to have the anxiety of
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
just waiting for it to end or to I read
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
determination all the time and I get
 
03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
anxiety from that so I don't need the
 
03:26:06.410 --> 03:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
anxiety of having that plus waiting to
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
see if this is over you know like with
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%

03:26:15.050 --> 03:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
provoking so if you have any questions I
 
03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:16.439 align:start position:0%

committee
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Peter Mason I'm here
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
representing the medical society and
 
03:26:49.010 --> 03:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
headrest I'm a family physician and I've
 
03:26:50.929 --> 03:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
practiced in Lebanon for over 40 years
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
since 2005 I've worked extensively with
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
individuals struggling with substance
 
03:26:58.130 --> 03:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
use disorders and I'm currently the
 
03:27:00.050 --> 03:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
medical director of headrest an
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
outpatient and Transitional Living
 
03:27:04.490 --> 03:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
facility for people in recovery with
 
03:27:06.410 --> 03:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
offices in Lebanon and a sober living
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
house in Boston approximately 90 percent
 
03:27:10.849 --> 03:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
of the individuals I care for are
 
03:27:13.010 --> 03:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid when Medicaid
 
03:27:16.490 --> 03:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
expansion became effective in 2014 it
 
03:27:19.790 --> 03:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
enabled them to access to have access to
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
treatment for their substance use
 
03:27:24.130 --> 03:27:24.140 align:start position:0%
disorders as well as for other chronic
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
physical and emotional illnesses
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
suddenly they were able to establish
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
with pcps and get preventative and
 
03:27:34.190 --> 03:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
continuity care rather than presenting
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
to emergency rooms in crisis when their
 
03:27:40.010 --> 03:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
problems were more advanced lead to more
 
03:27:43.610 --> 03:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
expensive inefficient and episodic care
 
03:27:45.889 --> 03:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
as a result Medicaid expansion has
 
03:27:48.170 --> 03:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
decreased the burden of illness and it
 
03:27:50.330 --> 03:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
saved countless dollars
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
as bad as a healthcare system is today
 
03:27:53.929 --> 03:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine how much worse
 
03:27:55.130 --> 03:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
things would be without Medicaid
 
03:27:55.140 --> 03:27:56.809 align:start position:0%
things would be without Medicaid
expansion

03:27:56.809 --> 03:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
03:27:59.090 --> 03:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
I've delivered hundreds of babies but
 
03:28:02.090 --> 03:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
equally rewarding is the work I do with
 
03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
people in recovery
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
to see them stabilize get their lives
 
03:28:10.250 --> 03:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
back together engage in productive work
 
03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
reunite with the loved ones and stay out
 
03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
of trouble is incredibly gratifying many
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
of these individuals have a history of
 
03:28:18.239 --> 03:28:20.090 align:start position:0%
of these individuals have a history of
incarceration

03:28:20.090 --> 03:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
now their productive tax paying members
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
of society we need to make Medicaid
 
03:28:30.530 --> 03:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
expansion permanent without the clarity
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
of funding that permanent
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
reauthorization provides not only the
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
agency I work for but also so many other
 
03:28:40.250 --> 03:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
Health and Social Service Providers
 
03:28:42.530 --> 03:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
would not be able to continue their work
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
and most importantly the people we're
 
03:28:47.090 --> 03:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
serving will lose the care that they so
 
03:28:49.370 --> 03:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
desperately need please support this
 
03:28:51.349 --> 03:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm happy to take any
 
03:28:51.359 --> 03:28:52.969 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm happy to take any
questions

Charities to register our support for
 
03:29:47.870 --> 03:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 263. I have just two quick
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
comments to make
 
03:29:49.800 --> 03:29:51.290 align:start position:0%
comments to make
first

03:29:51.290 --> 03:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
a bill like this is important for a
 
03:29:57.170 --> 03:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
number of reasons and one of them is
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
that it uh once again
 
03:30:04.010 --> 03:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
re-emphasizes the fundamental place of
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
the principle of the common good and
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
you've heard me say in front of this
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
committee before that it's important for
 
03:30:13.790 --> 03:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
us to remember that the principle of the
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
common good is not just a religious
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
sentiment but it is at the heart of the
 
03:30:22.729 --> 03:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
Constitutional order that was left us by
 
03:30:25.969 --> 03:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
the framers of the Constitution part one
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
article one of the New Hampshire
 
03:30:31.490 --> 03:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that that government
 
03:30:36.610 --> 03:30:36.620 align:start position:0%
was instituted for the general good
 
03:30:36.620 --> 03:30:38.570 align:start position:0%
was instituted for the general good
second

03:30:38.570 --> 03:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:30:40.729 --> 03:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
um it's clear from what you've heard and
 
03:30:43.250 --> 03:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
what you will hear that the granite
 
03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage program has improved the live
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
lives of tens and tens and tens of
 
03:30:53.870 --> 03:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire citizens
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
and there are many people obviously who
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
are alive today because of the health
 
03:31:04.190 --> 03:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
care that they received undergraded
 
03:31:06.769 --> 03:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
advantage that seems obvious
 
03:31:10.610 --> 03:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
and so manifestly in our view Senate
 
03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
Bill 263 is a bill that can and should
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
now the Medicaid Program may not be
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
perfect but we think that this bill
 
03:31:29.389 --> 03:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
boils down to just one question
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
what would be the mechanism for
 
03:31:35.210 --> 03:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
providing Health Care to the Granite
 
03:31:37.030 --> 03:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage population
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
if Granite Advantage were to disappear
 
03:31:44.809 --> 03:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
and since we all know what the answer to
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
that question is we think that and we
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
ask we think that Senate Bill 263 is a
 
03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
good idea and we ask you to vote ought
 
03:31:58.250 --> 03:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you thank you
 
03:32:01.630 --> 03:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative King
 
03:32:04.610 --> 03:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:32:08.929 --> 03:32:08.939 align:start position:0%
um through the whole Medicaid process
 
03:32:10.670 --> 03:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
that we've gone through this session
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
I've I've been asking the question where
 
03:32:17.150 --> 03:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
the churches fit in in helping out with
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
some of our societal issues that we have
 
03:32:23.210 --> 03:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
well the the from the Catholic Church's
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
perspective the um the church and the
 
03:32:29.929 --> 03:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
state have an obligation to work
 
03:32:34.190 --> 03:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
together to serve the common good
 
03:32:36.650 --> 03:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and in fact we believe that the
 
03:32:38.570 --> 03:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
Catholic church in New Hampshire through
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
its um diocese and through its parishes
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
and institutions is second only to the
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as a provider of
 
03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
charitable care
 
03:32:54.650 --> 03:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so it's I think something where both
 
03:32:57.290 --> 03:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
sides need to do their work
 
03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
I think the churches are doing the work
 
03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
and this is where the state gets to
 
03:33:05.330 --> 03:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
stand up and do the same
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
03:33:17.450 --> 03:33:17.460 align:start position:0%

behalf of myself on behalf of Dartmouth
 
03:34:02.690 --> 03:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
health and that of many of my position

in pediatrician colleagues I too I'm
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
going to put a little personal face on
 
03:34:10.130 --> 03:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
this most of my patients are younger and
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
so they don't qualify for Medicare
 
03:34:14.210 --> 03:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Advantage but my parents of my
 
03:34:16.729 --> 03:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
kids do and I'd like to speak with one
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
example of taking care of many parents
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
who have unmet health care needs and for
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
many years that's been the case but I'm
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
going to talk about a success story I'll
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
talk about Julie that's not her real
 
03:34:28.010 --> 03:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
name but I've known Julie for about
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
seven years as the pediatrician for her
 
03:34:32.510 --> 03:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
kids and about a year ago we had her
 
03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
come in for her uh daughter's six month
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
well child check we screen all of our
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
moms at six months for maternal
 
03:34:40.729 --> 03:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
depression and she scored incredibly
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
high and in depression and in talking
 
03:34:45.170 --> 03:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
with her she said I don't know how I can
 
03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
pay for this and then she said wait a
 
03:34:48.530 --> 03:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
minute I just got Health Care insurance
 
03:34:50.690 --> 03:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
through Medicare Medicaid Advantage we
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
were able to get her the health she need
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the help that she needed she was already
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
employed she works at a grocery store
 
03:34:58.429 --> 03:34:58.439 align:start position:0%

03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.100 align:start position:0%

a very short statement
um

03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired physician
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
I live in New Market and I serve on the
 
03:36:11.330 --> 03:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
board of Southeastern New Hampshire
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
Services those services are drug and
 
03:36:16.250 --> 03:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
alcohol treatment services
 
03:36:19.190 --> 03:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
so my comments will be an echo of what
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
03:36:22.319 --> 03:36:23.210 align:start position:0%
a bit
um

03:36:23.210 --> 03:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
yeah my point of reference is Saving
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
Lives it's uh goes with my practice
 
03:36:30.600 --> 03:36:32.110 align:start position:0%
Lives it's uh goes with my practice
and

03:36:32.110 --> 03:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
Southeastern does that it's in Dover
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the services it provides our outpatient
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and inpatient treatment of substance use
 
03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:43.849 align:start position:0%
and inpatient treatment of substance use
disorders

03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
03:36:43.859 --> 03:36:45.050 align:start position:0%
disorders
um

03:36:45.050 --> 03:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
it's been there doing that for 40 years
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
I've served on the board for 23. I do
 
03:36:54.429 --> 03:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
that because this is a valid effective
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
organization struggling to help people
 
03:36:59.990 --> 03:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
who are struggling
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
to get out of addiction and into
 
03:37:02.279 --> 03:37:03.590 align:start position:0%
to get out of addiction and into
recovery

03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's hard work
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement of our staff is really
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
inadequate and
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
with inflation and competing salaries
 
03:37:16.620 --> 03:37:18.130 align:start position:0%
with inflation and competing salaries
elsewhere

03:37:18.130 --> 03:37:18.140 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:37:22.130 --> 03:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's a real problem for us
 
03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
90 percent of our clients
 
03:37:26.450 --> 03:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
are Medicaid
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our annual revenue is
 
03:37:29.399 --> 03:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our annual revenue is
Medicaid

03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
03:37:33.769 --> 03:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
and as you know we're dealing with a
 
03:37:35.450 --> 03:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
massive problem
 
03:37:38.690 --> 03:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
last year we had 434
 
03:37:38.700 --> 03:37:40.130 align:start position:0%
last year we had 434
confirmed

03:37:40.130 --> 03:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
confirmed
 
03:37:42.650 --> 03:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths
 
03:37:44.690 --> 03:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
and a few years ago when they measured
 
03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
oh someone's already said this a hundred
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
thousand nationally overdose deaths so
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
the work being done there is critical
 
03:37:58.250 --> 03:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
and the support we get from Medicaid or
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
bdas is also critical
 
03:38:04.269 --> 03:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to support this legislation
 
03:38:07.570 --> 03:38:07.580 align:start position:0%
anything that would enhance expand
 
03:38:11.809 --> 03:38:11.819 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage and ideally make it
 
03:38:11.819 --> 03:38:13.490 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage and ideally make it
permanent

03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
03:38:13.500 --> 03:38:15.170 align:start position:0%
permanent
um

03:38:15.170 --> 03:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:19.849 --> 03:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
we simply can't sustain our operations
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:26.090 --> 03:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
so I urge you
 
03:38:28.370 --> 03:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
to pass this legislation
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I thank you and I thank you all
 
03:38:33.790 --> 03:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
for all of the work you do for all of us
 
03:38:36.349 --> 03:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
all of the time
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:39.889 --> 03:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
you're welcome you're taking questions
 
03:38:42.170 --> 03:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions or
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Susan Stearns
 
03:39:21.769 --> 03:39:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.929 --> 03:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman McDonald and
 
03:39:25.610 --> 03:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:39:27.650 --> 03:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
my name is Susan Stearns and I'm a
 
03:39:29.330 --> 03:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
resident of samberton
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in support of Senate Bill
 
03:39:31.439 --> 03:39:33.170 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in support of Senate Bill
263

03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
263
 
03:39:35.330 --> 03:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the interest of full disclosure I am
 
03:39:36.889 --> 03:39:36.899 align:start position:0%
employed as the executive director of
 
03:39:39.530 --> 03:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire however I do not come
 
03:39:41.690 --> 03:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
before you today in that role
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
I come before you in what I consider to
 
03:39:46.670 --> 03:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
be my most important role
 
03:39:48.650 --> 03:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
that of a mother
 
03:39:50.809 --> 03:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
my child was first diagnosed with an
 
03:39:53.450 --> 03:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
emotional disorder at age five a serious
 
03:39:55.969 --> 03:39:55.979 align:start position:0%
one at age eight and a serious mental
 
03:39:58.130 --> 03:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
illness at age 14.
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
raising my child was not an easy task
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
however we were lucky
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
my employer offered health insurance
 
03:40:07.729 --> 03:40:07.739 align:start position:0%
that covered my child and he was able to
 
03:40:09.769 --> 03:40:09.779 align:start position:0%
access the mental health treatment that
 
03:40:12.889 --> 03:40:12.899 align:start position:0%
kept him at home in his school and not
 
03:40:14.269 --> 03:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
in an emergency department or
 
03:40:16.610 --> 03:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
residential placement
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
as my child grew up there were many
 
03:40:20.269 --> 03:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
sobering realizations for me as a mother
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
that his path would often be different
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
from that of other children because of
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
his disability that not everyone in the
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
world would be as patient with him and
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
his approach to life
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
and that he might not be able to work 40
 
03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
hours a week for all of his adult life
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that he might not have access to
 
03:40:37.680 --> 03:40:38.929 align:start position:0%
and that he might not have access to
treatment

03:40:38.929 --> 03:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
that last one terrified me
 
03:40:43.250 --> 03:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
my child had been a treatment success
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
story despite some difficult times he
 
03:40:47.210 --> 03:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
never required a visit to an emergency
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
department or a hospitalization
 
03:40:51.889 --> 03:40:51.899 align:start position:0%
but without treatment which he would
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
lose access to without insurance I Knew
 
03:40:56.809 --> 03:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
Too Well what his path would likely be
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
he would decompensate
 
03:41:01.370 --> 03:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
probably become unable to function be at
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
risk of hospitalization or even
 
03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:05.630 align:start position:0%
risk of hospitalization or even
homelessness

03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
once that happened after what would
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
likely be a several year period he would
 
03:41:11.450 --> 03:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
probably be determined to be disabled
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore eligible for traditional
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because his mental illness
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
would have proven so disabling
 
03:41:19.849 --> 03:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
one in five adults and one in six
 
03:41:21.290 --> 03:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
children in our state has a mental
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
health disorder and I am certainly not
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
the only mother to lose sleep many
 
03:41:26.330 --> 03:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
nights fearing for her child's future
 
03:41:28.969 --> 03:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
Access to Health Care
 
03:41:31.190 --> 03:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
as my child approached his 26th birthday
 
03:41:33.530 --> 03:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
he and I sat down to apply for Medicaid
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
expansion coverage for him
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
a few weeks later his enrollment letter
 
03:41:37.500 --> 03:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
a few weeks later his enrollment letter
arrived

03:41:38.750 --> 03:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
arrived
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
and I read it and wept
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
since first becoming eligible for
 
03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion my child has had
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
periods where he has been able to work
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
and has had his health insurance
 
03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
provided by an employer or been able to
 
03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
purchase it himself on the marketplace
 
03:41:55.130 --> 03:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
when times have been more challenging he
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
has been able to access the mental
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
health treatment necessary for him to
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
live a full life through Medicaid
 
03:41:59.640 --> 03:42:01.250 align:start position:0%
live a full life through Medicaid
expansion

03:42:01.250 --> 03:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
so to all the legislators who enacted
 
03:42:05.809 --> 03:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion in our state and
 
03:42:07.490 --> 03:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
those who are working to move it forward
 
03:42:10.190 --> 03:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
with this legislation to reauthorize it
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
words cannot express the gratitude that
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
this mother has for the safety net that
 
03:42:18.410 --> 03:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion is provided to my
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
child and I know I am only one of many
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
parents to feel this way so thank you
 
03:42:25.190 --> 03:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
for helping us all sleep a little better
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
at night knowing our children have
 
03:42:28.849 --> 03:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
access to Essential Health Care
 
03:42:30.290 --> 03:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:32.809 --> 03:42:32.819 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:40.610 --> 03:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Christina
 
03:42:52.990 --> 03:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:56.150 --> 03:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Christina I am
 
03:42:58.190 --> 03:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
Christina Fitzpatrick I am the state
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
director for AARP New Hampshire and I am
 
03:43:07.150 --> 03:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in support of SB 263
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
ARP has 210 000 members in New Hampshire
 
03:43:13.190 --> 03:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
and what I would like to do is explain
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
to you today why
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
um why SB 263 and the permanent
 
03:43:21.889 --> 03:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
reauthorization of the program is
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
important for our constituents people 50
 
03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
and older and specifically people 50 to
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
64. because people older than that most
 
03:43:35.630 --> 03:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
likely qualify for Medicare
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
so people
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
um age 50 to 64 were probably not
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
eligible for health insurance through
 
03:43:47.570 --> 03:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid prior to the development of the
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Healthcare program
 
03:43:51.950 --> 03:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
because the program the Medicaid was
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
only available to people with children
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
people with a disability and some people
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
now with the Medicaid expansion the
 
03:44:06.530 --> 03:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Health Care Program
 
03:44:08.570 --> 03:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
um if they if they qualified with their
 
03:44:13.610 --> 03:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
low income they may have a job with no
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
health insurance they may have lost a
 
03:44:18.290 --> 03:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
job and have trouble getting a new one
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
um and that is more likely when an older
 
03:44:22.190 --> 03:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
worker loses their job it's much more
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to become re-employed
 
03:44:26.090 --> 03:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
and to become re-employed in a job
 
03:44:29.450 --> 03:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
offering comparable pay and benefits
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
insurance is especially important for
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
people 50 and older
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
because we know that people without
 
03:44:38.330 --> 03:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
access to to health insurance delay care
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
which can lead to late diagnosis poorer
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
outcomes more expensive treatment and
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's especially true for older people
 
03:44:48.050 --> 03:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
because they are more likely to have
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
health care needs more likely to have
 
03:44:51.889 --> 03:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
chronic health conditions that need to
 
03:44:53.570 --> 03:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
be managed
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
and the lack of health insurance can
 
03:44:57.170 --> 03:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
make it harder for them to stay in the
 
03:44:57.180 --> 03:44:58.910 align:start position:0%
make it harder for them to stay in the
workforce

03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
03:45:01.610 --> 03:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
you have heard from others about how
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is important for how extending this
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
program is important because it people
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
when people have access to health
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
insurance they are healthier
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
they are less likely to seek
 
03:45:16.010 --> 03:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care in hospitals that
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
leads to Savings in the state budgets
 
03:45:20.809 --> 03:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
means lower premiums for employers and
 
03:45:22.870 --> 03:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
for people with Private health insurance
 
03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
we get all of this with the federal
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
government absorbing 90 percent of the
 
03:45:31.729 --> 03:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
costs and this program brings in 500
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year to the state of
 
03:45:36.410 --> 03:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which helps to improve our
 
03:45:39.050 --> 03:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
economy in addition to helping people
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
maintain their health
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
we know that the granite Advantage
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
Healthcare program has created sizable
 
03:45:46.969 --> 03:45:46.979 align:start position:0%
positive effects in New Hampshire it's
 
03:45:49.130 --> 03:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
time to make the program permanent I
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in favor of Senate bill
 
03:45:51.239 --> 03:45:54.229 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in favor of Senate bill
263.

treatment
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
improving access is a critical step but
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
we have access having Access to Health
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
Care insurance through Medicaid
 
03:47:49.010 --> 03:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
expansion allows people to continue to
 
03:47:51.050 --> 03:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
participate in the treatment over the

long term
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
please allow me to share a couple of
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
examples Joe lives in Laconia he was
 
03:47:59.150 --> 03:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
previously uninsured homeless living in
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
a shelter and not engaged in treatment
 
03:48:02.929 --> 03:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
thanks to the granted Advantage Program
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
he became a patient of the local
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center in April
 
03:48:09.410 --> 03:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
21. with the help of the cmhc staff Joe
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%

Services through that program

he has remained positive throughout his
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
recovery and now three years later has
 
03:48:21.050 --> 03:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
his own apartment he's employed and
 
03:48:22.849 --> 03:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
actively focusing on his budgeting
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
skills so he can be more independent
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
Bob is a young man referred to the
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
Concord doorway from the Concord
 
03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
Hospital Emergency Department in the

spring of 22.
 
03:48:34.309 --> 03:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
during his assessment he identified many
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
barriers to staying engaged in treatment
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
he was uninsured unhoused unemployed and
 
03:48:41.330 --> 03:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
had a history of serious mental illness
 
03:48:43.010 --> 03:48:43.020 align:start position:0%

including considerable self-harm
behaviors

03:48:44.330 --> 03:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
Barbara eagerly completed the
 
03:48:47.450 --> 03:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
application for Medicaid with the
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
assistance of the doorway staff the new
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
parameters for expanded medicaid allowed
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
Bob to be eligible for insurance
 
03:48:56.330 --> 03:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
he was immediately successfully referred
 
03:48:58.130 --> 03:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
to the residential substance use
 
03:49:00.170 --> 03:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
disorder treatment program where he was
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
admitted for care within three days of
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
his arrival to the doorway
 
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
Bob continues to gain make gains in his
 
03:49:08.330 --> 03:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
recovery he has completed residential
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
partial hospital and intensive
 
03:49:13.190 --> 03:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
outpatient levels of care he has moved
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
into long-term recovery housing as of
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
the drug court is another successful
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
program that would not be able to
 
03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
function without Medicaid expansion in
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
this program clients commit to engaging
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
in treatment for mental illness and
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
addictions versus being incarcerated
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
having access to insurance is critical
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
to their success in the community I was
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
recently told the story of one client
 
03:49:35.450 --> 03:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
who had never entered treatment before
 
03:49:37.610 --> 03:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
this person this person first became
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
involved in the criminal justice system
 
03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
in 1985. it's a good start wrapping up
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay they spent a lot of time in the
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
prison system but at 48 years old was
 
03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
finally able to get access to care is
 
03:49:53.809 --> 03:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
working full-time and went back to
 
03:49:56.090 --> 03:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
school without the Medicaid Program
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
people like Bob and Joe would not have
 
03:50:00.889 --> 03:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
access to the services they need
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
this program is a Lifeline for many
 
03:50:04.429 --> 03:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
individuals in need of treatment and we
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
ask you to please support with an ought
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
to pass for Senate Bill 263. thank you
 
03:50:10.490 --> 03:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:50:14.809 --> 03:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
of Representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Miss Matson for
 
03:50:18.769 --> 03:50:18.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question I know that even with
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion that the community
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
mental health centers are
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
um struggle with funding and struggle
 
03:50:27.650 --> 03:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
with hiring people big struggle with
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
paying competitive salaries
 
03:50:31.630 --> 03:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
we all secretly are thinking well
 
03:50:37.010 --> 03:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion is going to be
 
03:50:37.020 --> 03:50:38.690 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion is going to be
reauthorized

03:50:38.690 --> 03:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
reauthorized
 
03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
um some of the you know the length of
 
03:50:41.460 --> 03:50:42.769 align:start position:0%
um some of the you know the length of
time

03:50:42.769 --> 03:50:42.779 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
Etc is in question but I think it's
 
03:50:48.769 --> 03:50:48.779 align:start position:0%
important for us to keep in mind that
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
about 10 states have not never passed
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion and so my question to
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
you is
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
what would it mean to your Center and
 
03:50:59.090 --> 03:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
the other Mental Health Centers of
 
03:51:01.610 --> 03:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion went away oh thank
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
you very much for that question it's
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to know that
 
03:51:08.450 --> 03:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
we are able to serve a demographic that
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
we were not previously able to serve and
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
I think that the you would see an
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
increase in the utilization of emergency
 
03:51:16.969 --> 03:51:16.979 align:start position:0%
departments an unfortunate increase in
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
overdose and other high-risk behaviors
 
03:51:21.530 --> 03:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
for folks who are not able to access
 
03:51:21.540 --> 03:51:22.630 align:start position:0%
for folks who are not able to access
treatment

03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
the open uh the ability to access
 
03:51:26.570 --> 03:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
treatment with the ease that has been
 
03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
allowed with Medicaid expansion has
 
03:51:30.290 --> 03:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
served thousands of people who would not
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
have sought care prior because it would
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
have no means for payment so it is of
 
03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
critical it's a critical nature for our
 
03:51:37.490 --> 03:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
organization to be able to serve them
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
and to be able to stay solvent in doing
 
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
that because we do not have the capacity
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
to provide the care without some type of
 
03:51:43.920 --> 03:51:45.229 align:start position:0%
to provide the care without some type of
compensation

03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
03:51:46.849 --> 03:51:46.859 align:start position:0%

treatment facilities and bouts of
 
03:53:57.060 --> 03:53:58.610 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities and bouts of
homelessness

03:53:58.610 --> 03:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
a little more than three years ago he
 
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
almost died from a drug of Overdose and
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
was luckily found and brought to the
 
03:54:08.450 --> 03:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
hospital where he was on life support
 
03:54:10.490 --> 03:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
for eight days
 
03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
he is now living with a traumatic brain
 
03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
injury it has been a long road to his
 
03:54:20.809 --> 03:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
own version of recovery but he hasn't
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
had a drink or in an illegal drug for
 
03:54:26.450 --> 03:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
almost three years
 
03:54:26.460 --> 03:54:28.550 align:start position:0%
almost three years
uh

03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:54:30.889 --> 03:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
it needs to be said that Jeremiah has
 
03:54:33.170 --> 03:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
struggled with mental health issues all
 
03:54:33.180 --> 03:54:34.870 align:start position:0%
struggled with mental health issues all
along

03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
along
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
fortunately he is living in Nashua and
 
03:54:41.150 --> 03:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
works at the hearts peer support center
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
and has many folks around him that are
 
03:54:46.849 --> 03:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
so important to his recovery
 
03:54:49.370 --> 03:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
most of this success is due to the
 
03:54:51.889 --> 03:54:51.899 align:start position:0%
assistance from the New Hampshire
 
03:54:54.010 --> 03:54:54.020 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Health Care Program
 
03:54:57.769 --> 03:54:57.779 align:start position:0%
and I say most of that's a large part of
 
03:55:03.170 --> 03:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
it uh SB 263 which reauthorizes The
 
03:55:05.570 --> 03:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
crucial and successful New Hampshire
 
03:55:09.050 --> 03:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Health Care Program is
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
one of the most impactful measures the
 
03:55:14.450 --> 03:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
legislate legislature can employ in
 
03:55:16.729 --> 03:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
supporting Granite Staters
 
03:55:19.490 --> 03:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
and I must acknowledge my wife's
 
03:55:22.969 --> 03:55:22.979 align:start position:0%
contribution to my our son's recovery
 
03:55:25.490 --> 03:55:25.500 align:start position:0%

03:59:37.250 --> 03:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
about 14 years ago around my 31st
 
03:59:39.889 --> 03:59:39.899 align:start position:0%
birthday I was diagnosed with a rare
 
03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
chronic cancer not a very fun birthday
 
03:59:42.479 --> 03:59:43.550 align:start position:0%
chronic cancer not a very fun birthday
present

03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:59:45.290 --> 03:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
at the time I was working as a case
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
manager for a non-profit organization in
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
my peers are planning weddings
 
03:59:55.729 --> 03:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
purchasing their first homes having
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
their first kids and I was left trying
 
03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
to wrap my mind around my cancer
 
03:59:59.040 --> 04:00:00.590 align:start position:0%
to wrap my mind around my cancer
diagnosis

04:00:00.590 --> 04:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
04:00:03.410 --> 04:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
I needed to learn about my diagnosis in
 
04:00:05.809 --> 04:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
treatment options while figuring out how
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
to cover all the costs of treatment on
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
my own
 
04:00:10.189 --> 04:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to leave my surviving
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
family with any medical debt or have to
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
take on the burden of financially
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
supporting me
 
04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
I wanted to remain as independent as
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
possible as most adults do
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
and after research I learned that cancer
 
04:00:25.250 --> 04:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
patients are two and a half times more
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
likely to file for bankruptcy after they
 
04:00:29.150 --> 04:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
are diagnosed according to the Fred
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
Hutchinson cancer research center based
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
in Seattle
 
04:00:35.990 --> 04:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
they say life is priceless but I beg to
 
04:00:38.570 --> 04:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
differ it comes at a cost
 
04:00:40.370 --> 04:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
as a single person supporting myself
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
financially the majority of my income
 
04:00:43.969 --> 04:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
went and has gone towards medical
 
04:00:43.979 --> 04:00:45.530 align:start position:0%
went and has gone towards medical
expenses

04:00:45.530 --> 04:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
04:00:47.210 --> 04:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
what I'm about to share is not a
 
04:00:49.130 --> 04:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
complaint but facts because I'm grateful
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
for what I do have
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
I have done the math and over the past
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
13 years with co-pays deductibles and
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expenses I would have
 
04:00:59.809 --> 04:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
owned a very nice home by now a nice car
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
and traveled
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
if I added up just the co-pays to see
 
04:01:05.689 --> 04:01:05.699 align:start position:0%
the doctors and it would be about twenty
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's just to step in
 
04:01:10.250 --> 04:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
foot in the doctor's office
 
04:01:12.650 --> 04:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
over the past 13 years I have delayed
 
04:01:14.570 --> 04:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
treatment skipped doctor's appointments
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
not followed up with recommendations and
 
04:01:20.290 --> 04:01:20.300 align:start position:0%
even delayed care due to Insurance costs
 
04:01:22.849 --> 04:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
at times I had to decide whether to go
 
04:01:25.010 --> 04:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
to the doctor's office or pay rent
 
04:01:26.809 --> 04:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
and I shared this with you today because
 
04:01:28.910 --> 04:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
most people looking at me would never
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
know that I was facing those choices
 
04:01:32.750 --> 04:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
those aren't decisions a cancer patient
 
04:01:34.849 --> 04:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
or anyone should have to make
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
I am not living the American dream I
 
04:01:40.130 --> 04:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
rented a car I rent an apartment drive a
 
04:01:41.689 --> 04:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
12 year old car and with paycheck to
 
04:01:44.210 --> 04:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
paycheck cancer is expensive and private
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
insurance is just as expensive but we
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
say life is priceless and our actions
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
need to start reflecting that
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
this year when my employer let me go I
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
could not keep up with my health care
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
costs and I couldn't afford cobra
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
while trying to meet my basic needs
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
applying for Medicaid was and the best
 
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
option I was so thankful I qualified
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid I've had the full access
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
to all the medical care I need including
 
04:02:14.090 --> 04:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
Home Health Therapy medication and for
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
the first time in my cancer journey of
 
04:02:18.530 --> 04:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
almost 14 years the primary focus has
 
04:02:20.570 --> 04:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
been on my health care not my insurance
 
04:02:22.490 --> 04:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
and insurance costs
 
04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
and with treatment in access to care
 
04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
I have regained strength and even
 
04:02:30.050 --> 04:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
started a small part-time job
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not waking up in the middle of the
 
04:02:33.650 --> 04:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
night thinking about or having to decide
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
to pay rent or delay treatment and be
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
able to seek the care I need follow up
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
on recommendations and not be concerned
 
04:02:43.130 --> 04:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
about racking up medical debt I don't
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
have to worry about debt collectors or
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
those notices in the mail
 
04:02:48.590 --> 04:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
the stress it alleviates is beyond words
 
04:02:50.210 --> 04:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
it makes me emotional just thinking
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
about it it's why I volunteered to share
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
my story with all of you today
 
04:02:56.689 --> 04:02:56.699 align:start position:0%

level

04:02:59.809 --> 04:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
not only am I a healthier person because
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
I have the care I need and don't have to
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
delay any treatment I am able to
 
04:03:07.969 --> 04:03:07.979 align:start position:0%

04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
importance of Medicaid and related
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
Services is uh I grew up impoverished I
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
was born in uh Lynn Mass and then when
 
04:08:41.450 --> 04:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
we left there there's no Mass health
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I got Medicaid uh in New Hampshire as
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
a kid uh healthy Goods gold I think and
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I was a great student uh a student
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
athlete great GPA
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and then I got addicted to a
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
prescription opiates
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
and uh from there I kind of fell off a
 
04:08:59.520 --> 04:09:00.349 align:start position:0%
and uh from there I kind of fell off a
cliff

04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
cliff
 
04:09:00.359 --> 04:09:01.010 align:start position:0%
cliff
um

04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
and only as a result of the services
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
which I couldn't have afforded on my own
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
in my life today
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
um between having to go to
 
04:09:12.410 --> 04:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know partial hospitalization or
 
04:09:14.210 --> 04:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
detox or being on life support when I
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
overdosed not to be too graphic but uh
 
04:09:18.410 --> 04:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd only sit before you today
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
because I I was provided a service that
 
04:09:21.769 --> 04:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
I definitely couldn't have afforded
 
04:09:21.779 --> 04:09:22.790 align:start position:0%
I definitely couldn't have afforded
myself

04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and now I have the uh not only honor
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
but a responsibility to my peers who are
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
going through the same thing locally and
 
04:09:30.120 --> 04:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
going through the same thing locally and
um

04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
they come out of detox rehab or they're
 
04:09:35.090 --> 04:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
homeless and they don't have the means
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
to pay for their own services and um
 
04:09:40.729 --> 04:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
these individuals uh over the first few
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
months they they're allowed you know
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
they're able to get the mental health
 
04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
treatment they need the physical
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
treatment some of them come in with a
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
lot of conditions drug and alcohol abuse
 
04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
are both devastating to the Mind into
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
the body
 
04:09:54.769 --> 04:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
um and then after about a year some of
 
04:09:54.779 --> 04:09:55.490 align:start position:0%
um and then after about a year some of
them

04:09:55.490 --> 04:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:09:55.500 --> 04:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
them
um

04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
make really good money and they pay
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
really good taxes and they have their
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
own insurance whether it be you know
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
they pay themselves or through the
 
04:10:05.809 --> 04:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
companies they're at and again they're
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
only alive and able to do this because
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
of that initial stepping stone so I know
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
this isn't speculation this isn't my
 
04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
guess this is uh first in experience
 
04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
that this works it works very well and
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
then ultimately even if it's about money
 
04:10:21.170 --> 04:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day these individuals
 
04:10:23.450 --> 04:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
myself included pay really good money
 
04:10:25.370 --> 04:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
for taxes and continue to buy back into
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
the program otherwise we would be a
 
04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
virgin on a system you know we're not
 
04:10:30.410 --> 04:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
going to be turned on health care and
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
then we can't pay for it no one's paying
 
04:10:34.849 --> 04:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
for it and uh we create a problem rather
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
than a solution so uh
 
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's my story man
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:10:44.929 --> 04:10:44.939 align:start position:0%

04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
great job of testifying and thank you

service living how close am I I'll let
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire I'm a recovery addict uh
advocate

04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
I'm a board member of the New Hampshire
 
04:12:13.250 --> 04:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
Coalition recovery residences
 
04:12:15.889 --> 04:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm the owner of seven certified
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
recovery homes
 
04:12:20.090 --> 04:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
our home serve a total of 100 residents
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
serving both men and women I come to you
 
04:12:26.210 --> 04:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
today representing those men and women
 
04:12:28.250 --> 04:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
typically someone arrives at our
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
recovery house after first completing
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
some form of inpatient treatment first
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
thankfully with Medicaid expansion New
 
04:12:39.050 --> 04:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has exponentially increased
 
04:12:41.570 --> 04:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
access to inpatient treatment options
 
04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
over the last five years
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
making it viable for providers to serve
 
04:12:47.809 --> 04:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid population
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
once that individual completes their
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
treatment program they are then stable
 
04:12:54.050 --> 04:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
and appropriate for one of our recovery
 
04:12:54.060 --> 04:12:55.070 align:start position:0%
and appropriate for one of our recovery
homes

04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
when they arrive many of them are
 
04:12:59.410 --> 04:12:59.420 align:start position:0%
connected to recovery support services
 
04:13:01.849 --> 04:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
such as laidac and mental health
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
counseling medication management and
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
medicated assisted treatment
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
this allows for a continuity of care
 
04:13:11.450 --> 04:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
which is incredibly critical in early
 
04:13:11.460 --> 04:13:12.710 align:start position:0%
which is incredibly critical in early
recovery

04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
04:13:14.929 --> 04:13:14.939 align:start position:0%
these essential Services would not be
 
04:13:17.150 --> 04:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
available to them without Medicaid
 
04:13:17.160 --> 04:13:18.229 align:start position:0%
available to them without Medicaid
expansion

04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
many of them wouldn't have found the
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
doors to inpatient treatment to begin
 
04:13:25.849 --> 04:13:25.859 align:start position:0%
with now fast forward several months
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
into their stay with us
 
04:13:30.170 --> 04:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
which ranges anywhere from six six to
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
eighteen months they're now gainfully
 
04:13:34.929 --> 04:13:34.939 align:start position:0%
employed they are stable on medications
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
they are beginning reunification with
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
their families and loved ones they're
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
resolving outstanding legal issues they
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
are becoming financially self-sustaining
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
they are now contributing to the
 
04:13:48.650 --> 04:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
community as opposed to burdening it
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
a large number of them are now offered
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
health coverage through their employers
 
04:13:55.729 --> 04:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
they no longer require Medicaid
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
with these examples the Medicaid system
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
is doing exactly what it's intended to
 
04:14:00.000 --> 04:14:00.710 align:start position:0%
is doing exactly what it's intended to
do

04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
to bridge the gap to a vulnerable
 
04:14:02.520 --> 04:14:04.070 align:start position:0%
to bridge the gap to a vulnerable
population

04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
without Medicaid expansion we have
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
higher rates of homelessness recidivism
 
04:14:11.450 --> 04:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
overdose and relapse Medicaid expansion
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
is a Cornerstone of all the progress in
 
04:14:15.710 --> 04:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's response to the
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder epidemic I speak
 
04:14:20.570 --> 04:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
for our residents when I say many
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here without it
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee in the legislature
 
04:14:26.689 --> 04:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
to permanently reauthorize Medicaid
 
04:14:26.699 --> 04:14:27.830 align:start position:0%
to permanently reauthorize Medicaid
expansion

04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
04:14:33.849 --> 04:14:33.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
could we get a copy of your testimony
 
04:14:36.180 --> 04:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
could we get a copy of your testimony

story my experience

you know the thing is
 
04:15:42.410 --> 04:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
from heroin addiction alcoholism crime
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
like I have totally ruined my entire
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
life I have it back now I got it back
 
04:15:51.650 --> 04:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
now I've done almost 17 years in prison
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
I've been in and out of treatment
 
04:15:56.210 --> 04:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
centers in Massachusetts and in Mass I
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
had to use State Insurance
 
04:16:01.370 --> 04:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
up here uh when I moved to New Hampshire
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
I had suffered an air fatal overdose and
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
ended up in a sober living a recovery
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
home in Littleton New Hampshire
 
04:16:10.010 --> 04:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
and when I went there one of the
 
04:16:11.570 --> 04:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
requirements was I had to get a
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
therapist and I I couldn't get it
 
04:16:15.469 --> 04:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
because I still had Massachusetts
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
insurance so New Hampshire wouldn't give
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
me Insurance until that was canceled and
 
04:16:25.130 --> 04:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
I get it uh and it just took a while so
 
04:16:27.110 --> 04:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know thank God for Littleton
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
Regional hospital they paid for me to
 
04:16:32.410 --> 04:16:32.420 align:start position:0%
see a therapist for over a year
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I was employed I ended up getting a
 
04:16:37.610 --> 04:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
job up there and then my employee
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
offered me insurance so I took that for
 
04:16:41.689 --> 04:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
a little bit but what I was noted and I
 
04:16:43.370 --> 04:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
became the manager of that recovery
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
house and what I noticed was
 
04:16:47.710 --> 04:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
guys coming out of treatment centers
 
04:16:50.210 --> 04:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
that had to live in these sort of living
 
04:16:52.610 --> 04:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
houses that had to follow rules but they
 
04:16:54.650 --> 04:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't because they couldn't get a
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
therapist because they couldn't get
 
04:16:56.580 --> 04:16:57.650 align:start position:0%
therapist because they couldn't get
insurance

04:16:57.650 --> 04:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:16:59.750 --> 04:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
now these guys don't have jobs they
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're barely you know uh cognitive
 
04:17:06.410 --> 04:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
they they don't know you know some of
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
them didn't even know how to make a bet
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the problem was I seen people leave
 
04:17:16.130 --> 04:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
because when an addict or an alcoholic
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
feels like they can't do something
 
04:17:19.560 --> 04:17:20.210 align:start position:0%
feels like they can't do something
um

04:17:20.210 --> 04:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:24.769 --> 04:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
it it puts a toll on on on on the way we
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
think and the way we feel about each
 
04:17:28.490 --> 04:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
other ourselves so people were leaving
 
04:17:31.370 --> 04:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
and relapsing and dying because they
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't follow the rules and when
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
someone gets clean that's all we want to
 
04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
do we just want to follow the rules and
 
04:17:37.969 --> 04:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
um to speed it up
 
04:17:44.210 --> 04:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
you know I would get phone calls to try
 
04:17:46.490 --> 04:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
to help people get into detox and every
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
time I would call these detox facilities
 
04:17:49.969 --> 04:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
the first thing they would ask is do
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
they have insurance
 
04:17:52.610 --> 04:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these guys that I was
 
04:17:53.570 --> 04:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
trying to help they didn't have
 
04:17:56.210 --> 04:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
insurance so what happens is now they
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
continue to use they continue to get
 
04:18:01.010 --> 04:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
high and we all know what happens now
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
now they continue to die
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.610 --> 04:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
basically if if this doesn't if this
 
04:18:16.010 --> 04:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't get permanently
 
04:18:19.130 --> 04:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
reauthorized like people are gonna die
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:18:23.090 --> 04:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
I had a good friend of mine
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
on a waiting list he was waiting to get
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
insurance and he relapsed and got high
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
one last time and he's dead
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know that was a really good friend
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
of mine whose struggled his entire life
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh with drug addiction alcoholism and
 
04:18:38.570 --> 04:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know to speed it up a little bit
 
04:18:40.490 --> 04:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
more if you could start wrapping up
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
please okay yes uh to speed it up a
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
little bit more I own a recovery house
 
04:18:47.450 --> 04:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh sober living like the one I got
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
cleaning and part of the requirement is
 
04:18:51.229 --> 04:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
you have to get insurance and you have
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
to get a therapist because a therapist
 
04:18:55.490 --> 04:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
is very important for someone like
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
myself to unpack all the trauma and
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
stuff that we've been through and we
 
04:19:02.990 --> 04:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
also allow folks that are on mat
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
medicated assistant treatment and I
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
think every guy in my house that's on
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
mat Medicaid is paying for so if they
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
don't have their Medicaid they're going
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
to be dope sick for a lack of better
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
words and what happens when we're Dope
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
Sick we go out we commit crime we rob
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
banks we rob stores we steal from our
 
04:19:23.389 --> 04:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
loved ones we get high or we die
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
so it's either we get insurance or we
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
can just buy body bags because that's
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen people are going
 
04:19:31.969 --> 04:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
to die so I urge you strongly or
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
encourage you to strongly reauthorize
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
this permanently and thank you for your
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.050 --> 04:19:45.060 align:start position:0%

04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%

expansion and SB 263 I'm employed by
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%

Mental Health provider so I am also so I

04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
benefits of Medicaid expansion
 
04:20:31.010 --> 04:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
insurance is another huge deterrent and
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
roadblock for our participants can I
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
interrupt can you move the microphone
 
04:20:36.170 --> 04:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
closer to you please we're having a
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%

better okay
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
insurance is another huge deterrent and
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
roadblock for our participants who
 
04:20:47.050 --> 04:20:47.060 align:start position:0%
struggle with substance use disorder
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion has allowed them to
 
04:20:52.030 --> 04:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
receive medicated assisted treatment MIT
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
higher levels of substance use treatment
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
like residential and partial
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
hospitalization programs psychotropic
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
medications and the ability to focus on
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
the recovery and reintegration to the
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
into the community instead of
 
04:21:07.610 --> 04:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
astronomical medical bills the vast
 
04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
majority of our participants rely on
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion for the substance use
 
04:21:13.370 --> 04:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
treatment and overall health care
 
04:21:15.410 --> 04:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
the stability that Medicaid expansion
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
has provided allows individuals to
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
address their substance use disorder
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
which allows them to find employment
 
04:21:21.479 --> 04:21:22.790 align:start position:0%
which allows them to find employment
that

04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
provides proper benefits along with the
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
paycheck they need to become independent
 
04:21:28.969 --> 04:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
I wanted to share with you a few
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
specific stories I've seen throughout my
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
time with drug court in Riverbend one

have 10 teeth pulled while on a mare

health and has fully fitted with posts
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
and partial dentures his mental health
 
04:21:47.090 --> 04:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
and self-confidence has entirely changed
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
since his procedure until this month
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
Mari Health was the only Medicaid plan
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
to offer dental coverage I've also seen
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
many participants go from relying on
 
04:21:58.729 --> 04:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
Suboxone a daily medication to fight
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
cravings and physical withdrawals to
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
supplicate a monthly injection that
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
provides the same effects supplicate is
 
04:22:08.090 --> 04:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars in injection
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
but it has decreased medication misuse
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
and allows for a slow taper off
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
medication altogether
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%

graduate our program
 
04:22:30.410 --> 04:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion hasn't just helped
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
individuals like these it is played an
 
04:22:34.490 --> 04:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
essential role in building New

04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
since Medicaid expansion residential
 
04:22:50.210 --> 04:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
facilities have opened their doors or
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
expanded Services as they are able to
 
04:22:54.349 --> 04:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
remain open due to program fees being
 
04:22:56.809 --> 04:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
paid by State insurance companies
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
it now can take less than 24 hours for

the drug crisis in New Hampshire I mean

never be fully eradicated but we can
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
continue to do everything we can to
 
04:23:50.929 --> 04:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
combat it and reduce the amount of

Overdose deaths
 
04:23:56.349 --> 04:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
this state sees every year

463 over to overdose deaths in New
 
04:24:02.090 --> 04:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire last year it's terrifying to
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
think what these numbers would look like
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
and how many lives would be lost without
 
04:24:07.969 --> 04:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion there to support
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
individuals and Families in Need and
 
04:24:12.410 --> 04:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
support our overall treatment system I
 
04:24:13.969 --> 04:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all for your time and
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
your consideration and permanently
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
reauthorizing Medicaid expansion
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:26.410 --> 04:24:26.420 align:start position:0%

thank you so much for taking my question
 
04:24:31.140 --> 04:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking my question
uh

04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
I hadn't thought about this aspect of it
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
before but would you say from your
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
experience that this not only has
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
benefits to the individual benefits to
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
Health Care overall but is also a crime
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
reduction measure absolutely
 
04:24:48.080 --> 04:24:48.830 align:start position:0%
reduction measure absolutely

04:24:48.840 --> 04:24:49.809 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:24:49.809 --> 04:24:49.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
providing treatment and having that
 
04:24:54.849 --> 04:24:54.859 align:start position:0%
available for our participants
 
04:24:58.130 --> 04:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
we see less recidivism
 
04:25:01.490 --> 04:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we do like a risk assessment which is
 
04:25:03.650 --> 04:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
the risk to reoffend um to be in drug
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
court you have to be high risk on that
 
04:25:05.399 --> 04:25:06.889 align:start position:0%
court you have to be high risk on that
assessment

04:25:06.889 --> 04:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:25:08.450 --> 04:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
um when I've been
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
redoing them before my participants
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
graduate they go from high risk to low
 
04:25:17.150 --> 04:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
um it's there the numbers with the
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
treatment that we're able to provide
 
04:25:20.809 --> 04:25:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
the work you do thank you other
 
04:25:23.040 --> 04:25:25.790 align:start position:0%
the work you do thank you other
questions

04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%

also signed up to speak is Keith Howard
 
04:25:42.290 --> 04:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Howard here
 
04:26:01.210 --> 04:26:01.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%

04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dave
 
04:26:43.010 --> 04:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
duvet I'm a senior vice president for

public policy for the business and
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
industry Association I'm here to convey
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
the strong support for New Hampshire's
 
04:26:53.929 --> 04:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
private sector employer Community for
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
this bill it's been a long hearing a
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
fruitful hearing so I'll keep my
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
testimony short I have provided written
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony when you receive the written
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
testimony you'll notice at the bottom
 
04:27:08.689 --> 04:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
bia's Mission which is promoting a
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
healthy climate for job creation and a
 
04:27:14.330 --> 04:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
strong New Hampshire economy
 
04:27:16.969 --> 04:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to think of any other
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill this session aside from perhaps the
 
04:27:23.330 --> 04:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
state budget that has more of an impact
 
04:27:26.210 --> 04:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
on job growth and a healthy New
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
but it could easily go the other way if
 
04:27:32.290 --> 04:27:32.300 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
is not is not
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
renewed at the end of the year
 
04:27:40.370 --> 04:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot from the provider
 
04:27:42.889 --> 04:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
community and a lot from individuals
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
explaining how important expanded
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
medicaid is to them it is equally
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
important to New Hampshire's employer
 
04:27:50.640 --> 04:27:53.570 align:start position:0%
important to New Hampshire's employer
community

04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
if this program goes away
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
means at the very least a billion
 
04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars every biennium will not be
 
04:28:05.330 --> 04:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
coming into the state from the federal
 
04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
government obviously that will have an
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
economic impact hospitals will feel it
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
directly but hospitals
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
sound like a cold entity hospitals are
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
really made up of individuals employees
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
whose job is to provide care to all of
 
04:28:23.880 --> 04:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
whose job is to provide care to all of
us

04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:28:27.290 --> 04:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
all of those individuals will feel the
 
04:28:31.370 --> 04:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
impact of that loss of Federal Aid to
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
support this program which means that
 
04:28:37.370 --> 04:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
their spending will be impacted they're
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
spending for food they're spending for
 
04:28:42.050 --> 04:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
rent they're spending for a mortgage
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
they're spending for schools cars any
 
04:28:48.649 --> 04:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
commodity will be impacted the ripple
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
effect of losing that money will spread
 
04:28:53.689 --> 04:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire's economy but
 
04:28:55.849 --> 04:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to focus on why this is
 
04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
important for employers especially
 
04:29:00.889 --> 04:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
employers who provide a health care
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
benefit and even more especially for the
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
small business employers who struggle to
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
provide a health care benefit if we lose
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
that revenue from the federal government
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
which supports this program we'll go
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
back to the battle days of 10 years or
 
04:29:22.130 --> 04:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
more where hospitals had to pass on the
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
cost for uncompensated care to other
 
04:29:27.649 --> 04:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
buyers of health insurance which in New
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is primarily employers what
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that means is employers especially the
 
04:29:35.410 --> 04:29:35.420 align:start position:0%
small business Community
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
it will make it even more difficult for
 
04:29:40.250 --> 04:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
them to provide a health care benefit so
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
I would suggest if this program is
 
04:29:45.769 --> 04:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
allowed to Sunset it's not only the
 
04:29:47.689 --> 04:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
people on the program who will lose
 
04:29:51.170 --> 04:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
access to health care insurance and and
 
04:29:54.530 --> 04:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
health care services it's many employers
 
04:29:56.090 --> 04:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
especially of the small business
 
04:29:58.490 --> 04:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
community that will also lose their
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
health care about it happy to answer any
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
04:30:03.000 --> 04:30:04.130 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
Shapiro

04:30:04.130 --> 04:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
04:30:06.050 --> 04:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
04:30:09.050 --> 04:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
jubay for taking this question I wonder
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
since you're talking about
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
the effects on Medical Care obviously
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
and on individuals but also on
 
04:30:19.250 --> 04:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
businesses on employers on the economy
 
04:30:21.530 --> 04:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
and all the cascading effects on the
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
other parts of the economy can you speak
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what the advantages
 
04:30:29.809 --> 04:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
or disadvantages would be of
 
04:30:29.819 --> 04:30:30.550 align:start position:0%
or disadvantages would be of
um

04:30:30.550 --> 04:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:34.130 --> 04:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
reauthorizing the program for two years
 
04:30:37.370 --> 04:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
versus making it permanent
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
well we support permanent
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
reauthorization I want to make that
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
clear one of the issues about just
 
04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
providing a two-year reauthorization I
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean is a practical reason there's no
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
reason to do so this is not a new
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
program we have 10 years experience and
 
04:30:58.729 --> 04:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
10 years of documented data showing how
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
effective it is so it doesn't make any
 
04:31:05.090 --> 04:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
sense to only reauthorize it for two
 
04:31:06.830 --> 04:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
years and then have to come back two
 
04:31:08.809 --> 04:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
years later and reauthorize it again
 
04:31:11.689 --> 04:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
other people testifying have spoken to
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
the safeguards that are in the program
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
so is a practical level I don't believe
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
that that's necessary or helpful it also
 
04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
I believe would impact in a negative way
 
04:31:30.530 --> 04:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
competition in the state right now for
 
04:31:30.540 --> 04:31:32.830 align:start position:0%
competition in the state right now for
for

04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
those entities that provide
 
04:31:40.189 --> 04:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
Medicare coverage
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful for them to know
 
04:31:45.050 --> 04:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
that there is a permanency to this
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
program by just having a two-year
 
04:31:50.689 --> 04:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
guarantee you are acting as a
 
04:31:54.110 --> 04:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
disincentive for other mcos to enter
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
this market so I would argue if you
 
04:31:59.450 --> 04:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
really want to increase competition and
 
04:32:01.729 --> 04:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
have a positive impact on health care
 
04:32:03.769 --> 04:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
costs this should be a permanent
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.410 --> 04:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions okay thank you thank

the New Hampshire Psychiatric Society
 
04:32:54.410 --> 04:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
strongly supports SP 263 because we
 
04:32:56.929 --> 04:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
believe it will improve access to mental
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
health care
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
and substance use disorder treatment in
 
04:33:04.131 --> 04:33:04.141 align:start position:0%
our state better access to mental health
 
04:33:06.289 --> 04:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
care and substance use disorder
 
04:33:09.051 --> 04:33:09.061 align:start position:0%
treatment is really the best way to
 
04:33:11.570 --> 04:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
address the Mental Health crisis in our
 
04:33:15.170 --> 04:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
state as well as the opioid epidemic
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
suicide is the ninth leading cause of
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
death in New Hampshire according to the
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
most recent statistics from the Center
 
04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
for Disease Control
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
and better treatment of underlying
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
psychiatric disorders can reduce the
 
04:33:32.449 --> 04:33:32.459 align:start position:0%
risk of suicide as you know there is a
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis in our state where
 
04:33:38.090 --> 04:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
citizens often must wait days or weeks
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
in the emergency department to access
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
mental health care that they need it is
 
04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
much better care and more cost effective
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
to enable citizens to get Outpatient
 
04:33:48.840 --> 04:33:49.609 align:start position:0%

covered by Medicaid at an earlier stage
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
in their illness where they can be more
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
successfully treated and avoid the need
 
04:33:59.570 --> 04:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
to be admitted to an emergency

department or Hospital
 
04:34:05.209 --> 04:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
SB 263 may also help to address the
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic in our state by helping
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
citizens to get treatment for opioid use
 
04:34:12.890 --> 04:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
disorder more easily which can help
 
04:34:17.330 --> 04:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
prevent tragic deaths from overdose
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%

04:34:26.449 --> 04:34:26.459 align:start position:0%
great way to improve access to mental

um I've had an opportunity over the last
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
15 years to work in states that have not
 
04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid states that have
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
04:35:49.799 --> 04:35:50.750 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
um

04:35:50.750 --> 04:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
additionally I'm uh over the past 10
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
years I've studied Medicaid expansion
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
and it's impact particularly on on
 
04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
common and costly surgical conditions
 
04:36:01.131 --> 04:36:01.141 align:start position:0%
and Cancer Care
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
it's in this capacity that I think I can
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
provide my strong support for SB 263 in
 
04:36:09.769 --> 04:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
order to do the same I moved to New

04:36:40.010 --> 04:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
who wasted away lost 30 pounds
 
04:36:42.410 --> 04:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
increasing abdominal pain waiting to get
 
04:36:44.929 --> 04:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
Medicare before his family found him
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
down in the bathroom in septic shock
 
04:36:49.490 --> 04:36:49.500 align:start position:0%

04:36:55.131 --> 04:36:55.141 align:start position:0%
uh Tanya 52 year old woman mother of two
 
04:36:57.289 --> 04:36:57.299 align:start position:0%
working mother of two
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
um who I first saw to put up permanent
 
04:37:01.369 --> 04:37:01.379 align:start position:0%
catheter and get chemotherapy seven
 
04:37:04.010 --> 04:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
months after Her diagnosis she couldn't
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
afford her insurance and subsequently
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
she had to spend her time finding a job
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
well feeling the cancer grow in her
 
04:37:12.840 --> 04:37:13.789 align:start position:0%

breast
 
04:37:15.051 --> 04:37:15.061 align:start position:0%
I think about another gentleman We
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
performed a life-saving liver surgery on
 
04:37:18.890 --> 04:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
um and on the day of discharge I went in
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
to talk to him and he was crying and I
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
said you know everything had gone great
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
from surgery he said I'm grateful for
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
all that you've done but my family had
 
04:37:29.330 --> 04:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
to sell the farm that's been in our
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
family for four generations in order to
 
04:37:32.570 --> 04:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
pay for this
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
now these aren't only anecdotes both in
 
04:37:37.010 --> 04:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and in States across the
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
country we know that expansion is
 
04:37:41.570 --> 04:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
associated with patients presenting with
 
04:37:43.730 --> 04:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
earlier disease that includes earlier
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
stage cancer that's more treatable and
 
04:37:49.490 --> 04:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
results in longer survival with those my
 
04:37:51.051 --> 04:37:51.061 align:start position:0%
preliminary evaluation in New Hampshire
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact which I'd be happy
 
04:37:54.769 --> 04:37:54.779 align:start position:0%
to follow up with you all shows that
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
after New Hampshire's Medicaid expansion
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
similarly there's reductions in the
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
stage at which cancer was diagnosed in
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this corresponds to
 
04:38:04.369 --> 04:38:04.379 align:start position:0%
additional likelihood of getting
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
treatment and improved survival
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
beyond the patients that it impacts I
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
also want to recognize the stability and
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
well-being that Medicaid expansion has
 
04:38:14.810 --> 04:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
on our surgical Workforce we've talked a
 
04:38:16.910 --> 04:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
little bit about the role that Medicaid
 
04:38:18.769 --> 04:38:18.779 align:start position:0%
expansion plays in hospital stabilities
 
04:38:21.529 --> 04:38:21.539 align:start position:0%
prior research shows that they there's a
 
04:38:23.090 --> 04:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
significant increase particularly in
 
04:38:24.769 --> 04:38:24.779 align:start position:0%
rural Hospital closures in states that
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
have not expanded Medicaid and so this
 
04:38:29.810 --> 04:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
isn't a hypothetical Factor we know from
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
across the state that without this
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage and what the pressures
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
that are going on in healthcare right
 
04:38:34.980 --> 04:38:35.650 align:start position:0%
that are going on in healthcare right
now

04:38:35.650 --> 04:38:35.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
rural hospitals in particular are facing
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
that stress
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
finally I want to talk about the moral
 
04:38:43.609 --> 04:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
injury that
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
um has led to a significant Workforce
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
shortage if you could start wrapping up
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
I I'd be happy to
 
04:38:52.010 --> 04:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
um not only from taking care of patients
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
that lack insurance but being told that
 
04:38:55.369 --> 04:38:55.379 align:start position:0%
we can't kicking out patients before we
 
04:38:56.449 --> 04:38:56.459 align:start position:0%
can take care of them because they don't
 
04:38:58.970 --> 04:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
have insurance that puts a significant
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
moral uh injury on per individuals that
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
leads them to quit the job or seek care
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
elsewhere this is an abstract we're
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
recruiting a surgeon up to Dartmouth
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
right now who's who when I told her
 
04:39:11.570 --> 04:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
about this hearing said well maybe I'll
 
04:39:13.970 --> 04:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
wait to hear what happens this is a very
 
04:39:15.289 --> 04:39:15.299 align:start position:0%
tangible thing for the lives and
 
04:39:17.390 --> 04:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
livelihood of our of granite Staters as
 
04:39:18.769 --> 04:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
well as the well-being of our Surgical
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
and Healthcare Workforce I urge you to
 
04:39:23.810 --> 04:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
support 263. thank you
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy thank you very
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for taking my
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just following up one of
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
your comments have you
 
04:39:34.609 --> 04:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
and maybe a misinterpreted what you said
 
04:39:36.529 --> 04:39:36.539 align:start position:0%
but have you ever been told that you
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
should not or could not take care of a
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
patient because of their insurance
 
04:39:40.200 --> 04:39:43.788 align:start position:0%
patient because of their insurance
coverage

04:39:43.788 --> 04:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.368 --> 04:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
yes not in New Hampshire oh okay that's
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire in New Hampshire I
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
have not not for granted health I'm not
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
for any of the marketplace plans uh and
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
not for the few uninsured that do happen
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
to come in I just want to be clear but
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
during your time at DH you have not been
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
told that you cannot take care of a
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
patient because of insurance coverage
 
04:40:02.630 --> 04:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you all of those
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
examples were in Prior States or prior
 
04:40:06.410 --> 04:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid expansion
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
04:40:17.690 --> 04:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Keith cooning
 
04:40:25.010 --> 04:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.448 --> 04:40:26.458 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how well I did with your
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
last name I apologize if I didn't do it
 
04:40:30.410 --> 04:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
well so
 
04:40:33.050 --> 04:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
close enough Mr chair hi
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair members of the committee my
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
name is Keith kinning I'm the advocacy
 
04:40:39.170 --> 04:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
director at Waypoint
 
04:40:41.690 --> 04:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
um we sit here in strong support of SB
 
04:40:41.700 --> 04:40:43.610 align:start position:0%
um we sit here in strong support of SB
263.

04:40:43.610 --> 04:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
263.
 
04:40:44.930 --> 04:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I want to give a little bit different
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
perspective on this
 
04:40:49.010 --> 04:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
um the way we approach families these
 
04:40:50.570 --> 04:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
days is we've learned not to approach it
 
04:40:52.788 --> 04:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
as a child issue or a parent issue we
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
approach things as the whole the family
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
needs help as a whole we've done this
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
now through voluntary services in a lot
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
of different ways and we see SB 263 is a
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
part of that so if you think about it
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
this way a healthy parent is a providing
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
parent and a healthy parent is a caring
 
04:41:11.930 --> 04:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
caregiver also if they're healthy they
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
can do the things they need to do and we
 
04:41:15.770 --> 04:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
also know
 
04:41:17.930 --> 04:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid expansion is critical more
 
04:41:19.730 --> 04:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
than just adults but is crucial to the
 
04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of the children so
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just the parents that benefit
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
the children benefit how do they benefit
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire more children gain
 
04:41:28.490 --> 04:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
coverage in the first five years
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
following the adoption of Medicaid
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
expansion this is consistent with
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
research done in other Medicaid
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
expansion States showing that when
 
04:41:37.010 --> 04:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
parents gain coverage they are more
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
likely to enroll their children in
 
04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
coverage and to take their children to
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
the doctor this has in turn demonstrated
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
an increase in well-child visits for
 
04:41:46.128 --> 04:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
children in Medicaid expansion States so
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
when the parent gets the health care
 
04:41:49.250 --> 04:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to take care of
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
their child in the Health Care system so
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
they're able to go off and provide and
 
04:41:54.890 --> 04:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
when the child gets otitis media they're
 
04:41:56.448 --> 04:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
able to put their child into the medical
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
system and make sure that that child
 
04:42:00.288 --> 04:42:00.298 align:start position:0%
immediately gets care and they don't
 
04:42:02.208 --> 04:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
hold the parent back from going off to
 
04:42:03.770 --> 04:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
the job that they need to go off to in
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
order to provide for the family so we
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
see SB 63 and Medicaid reauthorization
 
04:42:11.448 --> 04:42:11.458 align:start position:0%
as beneficial to the entire family
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
um we think it keep keeps the families
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
together and keeps them out of
 
04:42:16.850 --> 04:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
homelessness in other situations that
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
they can find themselves in if they
 
04:42:19.010 --> 04:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
don't have the health care and they
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
can't get to their their their work so
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
um for this reason that we support SB
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
