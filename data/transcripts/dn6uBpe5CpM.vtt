small high-level overview of who the
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
Services is and just briefly what the
 
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
role of the child support program is
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then more importantly for the
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee have an opportunity to speak
 
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 align:start position:0%
to our partnership with the New
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Circuit Family Division Court
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
which is uh I will anticipate of
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
Interest here
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
and certainly myself and attorney Hayes
 
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 align:start position:0%
are available to answer any questions
 
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
either now or for the future
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
um if the committee needs any further
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
information from the bureau
 
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so just to start to sort of level set
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
the child support program is encourages
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
responsible parenting Family
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency and Child well-being
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know by assisting uh in offering
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
services to families to help locate
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
parents to help establish paternity to
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
help establish and modify and enforce
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
child support obligations and to obtain
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
child and medical support for children
 
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
so really our goal is to help families
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
achieve positive outcomes by addressing
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
the needs and the responsibilities of
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
parents through the child and medical
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
support services that our program can
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
offer them
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
so our child support program is a
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
federal state and a tribal partnership
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's established by the Social Security
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
Act the title Roman numeral 4--d that
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
seeks to promote economic stability for
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
children whose parents or caretaker live
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
apart so we serve families both in state
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
out of state internationally and within
 
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 align:start position:0%
tribal communities
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
and our program really Services families
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
from all socioeconomic backgrounds so
 
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
either parent or caretaker May apply for
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
our services and we are not an
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
eligibility program
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
so you know nationally the child support
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
program is very successful it serves
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
about one in five children in the United
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
States about 13.2 million children
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and on a national level in
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year of 2021 the child
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
support program as a nationally
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
collected 32.7 billion dollars in child
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
support money for families in New
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our program serves
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
approximately thirty thousand families
 
00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:58.580 align:start position:0%
and collects about 76 million dollars
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
in collections annually as of federal
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year of 2021.
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
so our child support program as I stated
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
really focuses in on servicing families
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
single parent households to help them
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
receive a reliable source of private and
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
financial medical support services and
 
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
when I speak about medical and financial
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
that again is their appearance financial
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility as ordered by the court
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
through a um through a child support
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
order and a parent's responsibility to
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
provide health insurance or medical
 
00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:38.899 align:start position:0%
medical coverage for their children
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
so in keeping with that again as I uh
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
the core functions of our program really
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
include helping families establish
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
paternity legal fatherhood or parentage
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
locating parents The Establishment and
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
modification and enforcement of the
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
orders both financial and medical
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
support collecting and distributing that
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
support and helping families reduce
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
barriers to compliance with the those
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
orders for the success of their children
 
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.910 align:start position:0%
orders for the success of their children
so

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
could I interrupt you for a moment
 
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
could I interrupt you for a moment
um

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
if I heard you correctly you said
 
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
adjusting the orders in some way so that
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
is done
 
00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
in your bailiwick rather and then in the
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
courts bill
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so there are two primary if I may
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
there are two primary areas that the
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually works with the family division
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
Court one is in the establishment and or
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
modification of child support orders and
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement of child support
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
orders so through our uh primary through
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
the establishment and or modification
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
families who apply for and or request
 
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
for our services or or their child
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
support orders who are ordered to be
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
payable through the child support
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
services families could ask for our
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
assistance in helping them to adjust and
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
modify their orders if it complies with
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
the current child support guidelines
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
and if it reaches that opportunity for a
 
00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.410 align:start position:0%
and if it reaches that opportunity for a
modification

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
modification
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
certain families that we work with if
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
our program identifies an area where an
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
order may be eligible for review either
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:38.899 align:start position:0%
as currently outlined in our guidelines
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
we will notice our families and give
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
them an opportunity if they would like
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
to request our services to assist them
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
to try to modify their orders but all
 
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.140 align:start position:0%
the orders in New Hampshire of course
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
there are multiple types of petitions
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
and actions brought by the bureau on
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of families who have applied for
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
our services but there are also
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances where families bring forth
 
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
orders to the court directly that are
 
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
considered private action cases that the
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
Bureau of child support would not
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily have involvement in so again
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
the families we serve are those families
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
who have ultimately applied for our
 
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.569 align:start position:0%
who have ultimately applied for our
services

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
so in the private action cases those are
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
typically divorce and parenting
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
petitions which the court will include a
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
uniform support order for child and
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
medical support in those cases but our
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
Bureau is typically not involved in
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
those private action cases until after
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
an order is issued and somebody has
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
requested for our services to
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
um either comply or monitor or enforce
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
so as I had mentioned the Bureau of
 
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:03.740 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
works with the bureau excuse me works
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
with the family division in the two
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
primary areas and we
 
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
um we do that through a Cooperative
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
agreement with the New Hampshire
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
Administrative Office of the courts so
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support works very
 
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
closely with the New Hampshire family
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
court and the New Hampshire judicial
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
branch as as we know is the only source
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that's authorized
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
to perform these services in New
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this partnership that we
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
have with them really helps us to ensure
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
that our federally mandated expedited
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
process program for the establishment
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the modification of
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
orders helps to be in compliance with
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
our title Roman numeral 4D regulations
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
and through our state plan that we must
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
have in effect and in use in order to
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
provide these Services
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
it allows us to really help to establish
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
child support orders for families as
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible because the goal is
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
that we want to try to assist families
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
in getting Financial income as quickly
 
00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:17.459 align:start position:0%
as possible so our we work within our
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines and time frames to
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
try to work with our families to get
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
those orders and get families to agree
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
to orders if at all possible and then
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
quickly try to file them with the courts
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
could you tell us what those timelines
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
are so the expedited process really
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
encourages the child support programs to
 
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
try to seek an order for establishment
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
within a 90-day time frame
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and then from there it you know
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the start we want to try
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
to get a nine an order in place within
 
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
90 days from the date of service of
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
process to the time of disposition
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
um and we work hard uh to try to
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
facilitate that with our families
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
outside of Court whenever possible
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and then file any agreements that we
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
can with the court but in if unable to
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
do so then we have the ability through
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of child support legal
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
department uh to file those petitions on
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
behalf of those families to seek those
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
orders and and in those circumstances
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about child support
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
orders we're not talking about filing
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
petitions relative to Parenting plans or
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
relative to divorce or anything of that
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
nature again those are private actions
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
that's outside of the scope of the work
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
that the child support program does
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and our Bureau of child support legal
 
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.650 align:start position:0%
um and our Bureau of child support legal
unit

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:44.660 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
consists currently of about 18 staff in
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
total whose sole responsibility is
 
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:53.180 align:start position:0%
ultimately to research those cases
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
prepare and file those legal petitions
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
and work with the courts to try to
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
establish those orders as effectively
 
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
and efficiently as we can
 
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.509 align:start position:0%
and efficiently as we can
yes

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
may I just follow up on the timeline so
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
your timeline to seek an order from the
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
court is 90 days what about it when one
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
of the private action cases comes to the
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
bureau and says we would like this order
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
enforced what's the timeline from the
 
00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
enforced what's the timeline from the
time

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
um a citizen would bring you their order
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
to the time that the child support is
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
um when an order is received from our
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
program with an individual has applied
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
for child support services and they come
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
to us with a child support order we have
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
20 days to process the application and
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
then from there we have 90 days to
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
locate the individual who is responsible
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
for paying the child support and once we
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
have that locate information in place we
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
try to get that order up and running as
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible within at least
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
within a 30-day time frame we really
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
encourage we try to set the internal
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
parameter to try to get our orders up
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
and running within a couple of weeks
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
again all of those circumstances depend
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
upon whether or not we're able to have a
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
valid information on all the parties
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
that are involved so that we can ensure
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
that payments are being received and
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
distributed as quickly as possible
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
um so to speak just really briefly again
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned the two primary areas
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the Bureau of Child Support
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
Services works with the family division
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
Court was establishment I've spoken
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
about that the other half of uh the work
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
that we do with the child of the Family
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
Division court is through civil contempt
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
and or otherwise known as show cause
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
hearings perhaps for the enforcement of
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
child support orders of course the
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services really
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
has an array of administrative
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement remedies and Court action
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
for us is always a last resort it is
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
really important that we ensure that
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
there is an actual that we we make every
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
effort to try to have to try to work
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
with a parent who is ordered to pay
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
child support to identify what if any
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
barriers they may have to be successful
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
in complying with their order and our
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
staff are equipped with the tools that
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to try to encourage
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
parents to comply on their own before we
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
take any type of enforcement or Court
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
action against them and we go through we
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that we've made every
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
effort possible
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
before we take um matters to court for
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
show cause hearings and our uh in 2016
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
the um the Federal Regulation titled the
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
flexibility efficiency and modernization
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
final rule was revised to ensure that
 
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:13.700 align:start position:0%
criteria for child support agencies
 
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.850 align:start position:0%
criteria for child support agencies
was

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:15.860 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
implemented so that
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
our child support programs could
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
determine and prepare and refer
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate cases to Courts for civil
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
contempt proceedings and within those
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
parameters the child support programs
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
are responsible to ensure that we have
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
actual and present information evidence
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
to support that an obligor or a person
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's responsible to pay child support
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
has the ability to comply with those
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
support orders and that's always
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
something that we're looking at and our
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
staff are looking at at the Forefront
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
so through our court administrative
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
order our child support staff are uh
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
that are employed by my Bureau are are
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services are
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
able to act in their official capacity
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
by bringing these cases forward and
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
presenting information to the courts for
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
consideration in these show cause
 
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.610 align:start position:0%
consideration in these show cause
proceedings

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.990 align:start position:0%
proceedings
so

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and these uh we you know our Bureau
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Services has worked uh
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
historically with the family division
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
Court to ensure that there's a uniform
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement process in place for these
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
types of civil uh contempt proceedings
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
brought forth through the court so
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
currently our program has 43 child
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
support officers who work with both
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
parents both for the establishment and
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
the child's uh enforcement as well as
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
the monitoring and compliance of child
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
support orders and
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to note that
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
through our Cooperative agreement with
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
the family division Court one that we've
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
had in place with a long-standing
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
history with the court and working with
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
the court that we continue to be able to
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
implement some ongoing activities for
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
regular liaison meetings with the family
 
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:09.140 align:start position:0%
division court and to ensure Statewide
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
Provisions are being met and to allow
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
for us to have some cross training
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
between our staff and the Family
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
Division Court staff you know child
 
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
support matters are really complex
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
families uh and and family circumstances
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
can be really complex so it's important
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our programs are both well
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
aware of ways that we can best support
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
those families that we're serving in the
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
variety of capacities
 
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.490 align:start position:0%
variety of capacities
so

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
um in coming here today and giving the
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak before the
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee there were a couple of things
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to bring to the
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee's attention just to
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
potentially share for considerations
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
that the committee may be able to take
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:06.620 align:start position:0%
in in relation to child support
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services and
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
Services here in New Hampshire is
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
required every four years by Statute to
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
facilitate a quadrennial review report
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
for our child support guidelines our
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
most recent the most recent report was
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
completed in December of 2022 and the
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee may want to consider taking a
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
look at that report if they if the
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
committee has not already to consider
 
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:36.539 align:start position:0%
the recommendations within that report
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
and how that might impact the work that
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
you're doing here there is some current
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
data in there from the work that our
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
program does as well as the Family
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
Division Court does with the child
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
support related matters and how that may
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
impact the child support guidelines
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
and two other areas of notation are just
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
I just interrupted with that in that
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
report which will be
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
um made available to us uh
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
are there particular recommendations
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh to which you would like to draw our
 
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.610 align:start position:0%
uh to which you would like to draw our
attention

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative I again I think that all
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
of the considerations should be take I
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
think all the recommendations should be
 
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
think all the recommendations should be
considered

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that there has been over the
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
last uh several quadrennial reviews
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
um some information made available to
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
our representatives in consideration for
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
what the legislature feels are the most
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate fair and Equitable changes
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
for our citizens and our job is to get
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
you the information from in that report
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
to help make to help consider what those
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
positions and considerations might be
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know the bureau really looks at is
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
here to provide that resource to you
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
but not really
 
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.730 align:start position:0%
but not really
um

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.190 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to necessarily include or
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
exclude any one of the potential
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
recommendations so I hear very clearly
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I certainly share
 
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
um all of our beliefs that in this world
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
everything is equal but some are more
 
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:36.380 align:start position:0%
equal than others and if we cannot
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
get some helpful guidelines from those
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
people who are best situated to advise
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
us then that makes it much more
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
difficult for the legislature to do the
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
responsible things so I don't want to
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
pressure you and if you don't want to
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
answer I understand that you're under no
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
obligation but if you can identify some
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
that are more equal than others I do
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
representative law thank you madam chair
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
um with those recommendations are there
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
common denominators are they best suited
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
for payer payee
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
the bureau
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
or the court system Family Division do
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know or are they all over
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
so there were thank you representative
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
long and representative Smith for that
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
um there were ultimately 10
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were made by our
 
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.289 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were made by our
economists

00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:41.299 align:start position:0%
economists
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
that were that had completed the review
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
and they are partial in that
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
um basically they made recommendations
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
to update the guidelines percentages set
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
in statute and this is just the high
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
level recommendations from the executive
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
summary the report is available publicly
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
out on our department website for anyone
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
to view and certainly we could get that
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee if the committee
 
00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:11.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't already have that information
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
but again it was to basically update the
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines percentages set in statute as
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
I have it right in front of me revise
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
the statutory Provisions covering the
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
preparation of the schedule and annual
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
update to make the schedule simpler to
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
understand replace
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
income deductions for work related child
 
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
care and so on and so forth so there are
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
I I won't take the time to read all of
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
them here but there were a variety of
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were made for both
 
00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:47.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
I think too that um to for consideration
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
of the committee of course naturally
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
there are always opportunities I think
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
that the department and the Family
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
Division Court could possibly uh enhance
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
informational resources to families to
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
help them navigate some of the complex
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
areas that we deal with in relation to
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
child support so certainly the Bureau of
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
and the Family Division must meet those
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
increasing needs of families and for
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
their convenience of easy access to
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
services and if the committee has any
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
through your research and Gathering of
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.510 align:start position:0%
through your research and Gathering of
information

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some considerations there
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
where the bureau and the Family Division
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
can be more uh can enhance some of those
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
resources to our families to help them
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
navigate these circumstances
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
and of course I think it goes without
 
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
saying and I think you've heard this
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
already from several others who have
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
come before you at this committee is
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
that you know staff resources are always
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
something that could benefit both uh our
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
program as well as
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
um The Family Division I anticipate you
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
know we both strive to provide optimal
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
services and optimal Service delivery to
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
the families that we serve and we really
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
make every effort to try to meet those
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
time frames and work within the limited
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
resources that we have provided so you
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
know I our program really works to try
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we can be as efficient
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
and effective as we can for the families
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
that have applied for our services so
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
that we can ensure that families get the
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
income that they have been ordered to
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
receive and that we can help families
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
reduce those barriers so that they can
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
continue to support their children
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so um you know really in closing
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
the court is really a key stakeholder in
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
meeting the mission of the Bureau of
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
and to really encourage and generate the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
responsible parenting
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
um that um and self-sufficiency and
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
child well-being so we really depend the
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services really
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
depends on having a strong collaborative
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the court to
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
which we have had for many decades now
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we continue to Foster that
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
relationship with the court and we're
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
really grateful for the opportunity to
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
have be able to work with the court in
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
um Mr Hayes do you have anything you
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
want to add at this point
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
um director deckatowski did a good job
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
okay nothing further to add to that
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um Mr kotowski
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
in the interest of Cooperative
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration to achieve consensus
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
do you uh in in your statement I'm
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
saying you work with the family court
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
let's say every four years I'll say last
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
three reports
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
have any of your recommendations not
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
yours but the um child support
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
guardianship guidelines been updated
 
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
I'd have to take a look at thank you for
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
the question representative and I have
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
to take a look at the statute and I'm a
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
statute book in front of me but I
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
believe the last significant changes to
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
the Child Support guideline statute was
 
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
in 2013.
 
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.630 align:start position:0%
in 2013.
um

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
so it's it's been a little while since
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's been a big overhaul in the
 
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.169 align:start position:0%
there's been a big overhaul in the
guidelines

00:29:32.169 --> 00:29:32.179 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I may
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh but just in that today one other
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
question for you both
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
with that being said is uh we're here
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
because of the expression implied
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
conflicts of performance at the family
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
court level and those who have stand
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
before them the families
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
did the changes that these latest ones
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and that you indicated
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
give us 10 10 proposals made
 
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:01.940 align:start position:0%
of any of those
 
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:04.820 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
interactions of families petitioning
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
before the court to improve their ex
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
I think if you um in in reviewing the
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines review report
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
that was submitted and looking at the
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations there are certainly
 
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
recommendations there are certainly
um

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.289 align:start position:0%
um
information

00:30:32.289 --> 00:30:32.299 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
that is stated in the report that
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
suggests that parenting time and and
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
shared parenting time and deviations
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
from the child support guidelines if you
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
look at the deviation rates
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
um and the data that supports that in
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
the guidelines report which I don't have
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
that data in front of me and I would
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
want the committee to defer to the
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
report exactly and not take what I say
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
by wrote here but that there's a
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
significant amount of deviations from
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
the existing guidelines and that those
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
are the types of circumstances within
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
the review report that should be taken a
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
look at but as I stated before you know
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
again our role at the Bureau of Child
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
Support is to provide the committee with
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
a holistic approach excuse me a holistic
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
report of of current and relevant data
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the guidelines review report working
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
with our economists to provide the
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
legislative legislature with the
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
information to try to make what the best
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
decision is here for New Hampshire and
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
and we certainly
 
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:43.340 align:start position:0%
are available as a resource but and
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.950 align:start position:0%
willing to
um

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about the
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services and our
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
experience with that certainly the
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
report speaks to the data that we were
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
able to provide on behalf of the cases
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
and the families that we serve and the
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we see as well so it
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
gives you the um the balance between
 
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
both private action cases that we see
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
through the Family Division court and
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
the cases to which the Bureau of Child
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
Support Services
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%

whether the parent has the ability to
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
comply to the court order but came to my
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
mind then uh is do you represent both
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
um oh do both
 
00:32:56.889 --> 00:32:56.899 align:start position:0%

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
neutral third party
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
our job is to help both parents succeed
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the well-being and the success and
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the compliance of their child support
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
orders yes we have an applicant our
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
applicant is can be either parent either
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
the one responsible to provide the
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
support or the one to receive the report
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
anyone is allowed to anyone is available
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
to apply for our services but the role
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
of our program is to be neutral is to
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
provide service to both
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
um both parents for the success and the
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
well-being of their children yeah thank
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you and
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
um you had testified earlier that it
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
seems like there's two ways um the
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
people apply for your services either
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
the private action route or the the name
 
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
of what's the other route
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and the
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to clarify
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
um because it seems like perhaps I
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
didn't do that well enough
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so every individual who of every
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
person that we serve every family that
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
we serve has to apply for our services
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
even if they come to us with an existing
 
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
order or they don't have an existing
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
child support order and they would like
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
us to establish one
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
so regardless uh so we help families we
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of families that we help
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
um who who don't have parenting plans
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
who don't you know who have and again
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
ultimately the child support programs
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
Services a majority of families who are
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
single parent families who they've never
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
been married or not going through a
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
divorce but we do have another portion
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know we have a portion of our
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
families that we serve that do come with
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
us with existing orders already
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
so everyone must apply they either come
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
with us with an order or they don't have
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
an order and we work to establish one
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
so actually so in the case of someone
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have an order and I think
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
that goes back to the recommendation
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
about the deviations so then it's the
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
bureau themselves that are bringing
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
forth and suggesting perhaps the
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
criteria for deviation and whether or
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
not it might apply to that case
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you for the
 
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.370 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you for the
question

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
um no actually so the court is the only
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
one that can make the determination as
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
to whether a deviation the bureau's
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
responsibility would be to gather the
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
information of the applicant and gather
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
the information of the other individual
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
and the parents in the case we would
 
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:01.460 align:start position:0%
then do our best to try to
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
utilize the existing child support
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines and the formulas to establish
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
an order based on that income from both
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
parties in circumstances where they
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreement where there
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
may be circumstances
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
where they wish to agree to a different
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
amount or other factors may come into
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
play our job is to bring that
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
information to the court and the court
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
would assist in making a decision
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up just one more time
 
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.730 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up just one more time
um

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.370 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:33.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
the divisions officers are just trying
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
to get an agreement they wouldn't be are
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
they is there an affirmative
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
um responsibility for them to inform the
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
individuals they could go to the court
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
and perhaps get a different order
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is part we we give our
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
families every opportunity we explain to
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
them every circumstance that is
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
available to us we we lay out how the
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
process will work we try to do our best
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
to facilitate with families if they're
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
willing to come into our office to come
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
to an agreement if they can't then are
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
we will explain to them the court
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
process and how we will help to file
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
that petition on their behalf with the
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
court and that's sorry thank you I have
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
one I just is this one short may may I
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
um who pays for this is there a payment
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
for the services so when someone applies
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
is there a payment
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
so our our services there we have an
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
fee only that is for folks who apply for
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
our services
 
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's a 35 application fee if you are and
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.370 align:start position:0%
I don't
um

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get you the specifics
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%

annual fee for non-public assistance
 
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.609 align:start position:0%
annual fee for non-public assistance
recipients

00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
if I may add onto that um with respect
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
to filing petitions on behalf of the
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
parties um
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
as director takatowski pointed out
 
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.730 align:start position:0%
as director takatowski pointed out
um

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.170 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
our attorneys don't represent any of the
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
parties represent the state our client
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
is the Bureau where as she's pointed out
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
our purpose is to help get the parties
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
before the court so that decision on
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
child support can be made we file the
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
petitions and we affect service on the
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
other party so those are fees that they
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
would uh of a filing party would
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
normally have to pay that they don't
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
have to pay so I just wanted to make
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
sure the committee knew that as well
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that the um I I
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
heard you say you're responsible for
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
both child and medical support the
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
medical kind of flew me a little bit I
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
didn't quite realize that is the medical
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
also included in title 4D
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
or is it just child support
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you want to answer
 
00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:16.609 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you want to answer
that

00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
uh medical sport is in would be in title
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
40 as well and uh if we would enforce
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
medical sport if there was a separate or
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different ways it comes
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
up uh medical support can also can be uh
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
in a in a support order let's say the
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
party's split medical costs on internal
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
medical costs 50 50 which is typically
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
what happens uh if someone incurred
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
let's say a thousand two thousand
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
dollars in medical costs and the other
 
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.990 align:start position:0%
dollars in medical costs and the other
party

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
you know wasn't making payments on their
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
own and they had to go to court the
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
court would adjudicate that arrange and
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
that would be a special medical support
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
or rearing that would be separate from
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
child support and that that's some type
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
that's one type of a rear edge that the
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's one way it comes up and then the
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
other way it comes up is with medical
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
or health insurance on the bureau
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
has enforcement remedies it can use to
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
compel compliance with a court order
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
with respect to obtaining health
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
insurance for a child
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you
 
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:37.550 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you
no

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
if you could help clarify something for
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
me you talked about the deadlines you
 
00:40:47.089 --> 00:40:47.099 align:start position:0%
have a timeline 30 days 90 days whatever
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
um do you keep track in any way of
 
00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:53.710 align:start position:0%
um do you keep track in any way of
um

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
however you measure it let's just say
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
the percentage of cases which uh fall
 
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:02.540 align:start position:0%
within the uh
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
established timelines and those that do
 
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.829 align:start position:0%
established timelines and those that do
not

00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes we do
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative and we can certainly get
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
you and the committee those percentages
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much can you tell me
 
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.810 align:start position:0%
thank you very much can you tell me
um

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
is do you ever find yourself in a
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
situation where there is a conflict
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
between the Federal
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
not that I can speak to no
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's a relief
 
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:51.980 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for the time that
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
you've given to us
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to do the right thing
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we need the input from you I do
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand that the report you
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier is
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
um working its way through
 
00:42:10.619 --> 00:42:11.210 align:start position:0%
um working its way through
um

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
to get to all members of the committee
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
and so we will benefit from that is
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
there anything else that you could say
 
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.470 align:start position:0%
there anything else that you could say
um

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
reach our goal which is making sure that
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything we can to ensure
 
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
living up to its obligations to meet the
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
needs of the people of the state
 
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:41.930 align:start position:0%
needs of the people of the state
um

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
you've already mentioned one that
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
applies to you when we know it applies
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
to the courts and that's the
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
availability of resources and so that we
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand but is there anything else
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
that you might want to just in closing
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
share with us
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
um no I don't have anything additional
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
to say in closing we just want to thank

thank you
um

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative bigford
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
I I see a card from you do you want to
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
speak with reference to
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
um the child support
 
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:52.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
oh is that what you would like to speak
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
to today then I would like to recognize
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
you following this and then we'll move
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
well yes we have Ned Gordon but if what
 
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:15.260 align:start position:0%
you want to speak about is is this
 
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:18.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
fine then I think that we'd like to hear
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
no no no I'm I'm taking the prerogative
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the the chair to say that um we get
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
confused easily here and we want to make
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
sure that we keep
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
like topics together
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
no I assume you don't need a quorum to
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
we do not need a quorum we are not
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
voting as you know representative
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
Bickford that's the only time we need a
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
quorum okay good and you also know that
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
this is being recorded I do and it's and
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's being seen live and at least one of
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
our absentees is home with the dreaded
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
covid and probably watching oh I do
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
watch these I've only missed the last
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
one so far and uh I can hear them very
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
well on the uh
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
monitor my computer monitor
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyway what I wanted to speak to is that
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
the problem with child support is is not
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
to me it's not the courts and it's not
 
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
to me it's not the courts and it's not
the

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
Department of Child Support Services the
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
problem is the guidelines themselves
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
now I was on the uh commission to study
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
child support in 2004.
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I learned a tremendous amount at
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
that time I was the vice chair of that
 
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.990 align:start position:0%
that time I was the vice chair of that
committee

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to go back and speak to
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of the background
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh which I've learned a lot from the
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
these quarterly
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
um some of those that are lawyers uh the
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
family law quarterly
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
I used to subscribe to and they're
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
incredible information in them
 
00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.210 align:start position:0%
incredible information in them
anyway

00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.290 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
the problem is legislative negligence
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the real problem is here
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
um but historically it was in 1985
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
Lenore Weitzman wrote a book titled the
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
divorce Revolution
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
they claimed women and children averaged
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
a 73 percent drop in standard of living
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
after divorce while fathers increase 42
 
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.450 align:start position:0%
after divorce while fathers increase 42
percent

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be completely false
 
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be completely false
but

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
it ignited a child support Revolution at
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
the federal level and Congress
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
strengthened the guidelines requirement
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
through the Family Support Act of 1988
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
Section 102 of the ACT requires states
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
to provide by October 13
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
1989 that in any judicial or
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
administrative support proceeding there
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
shall be a rebuttable presumption that
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
the guideline amount is correct
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
since then a lot has changed we have
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
many more parents that both parents are
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
the uh taking care of their children
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
and we changed the law in New Hampshire
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
and get rid of the term visitation so we
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
now have two parents well we used to
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
have just one though the guidelines are
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
created for
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
to be one parent and one visitor that
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
has parental responsibility particularly
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
and that creates a real problem to try
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
to adjust and it's even bigger problem
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
when you try to factor in lifestyle
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
rather than just support levels
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
the following is from the review of the
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire child support guidelines
 
00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:52.339 align:start position:0%
of December 31 of
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
2022. it's I believe 200 pages of it
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's very good well done
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they paid for it I
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
happen to have all of the reviews done
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
the four-year studies required by the
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
federal government so if anybody's
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
interested in historical information I'd
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
be happy to share that
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I had research here get them uh for
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
me and Bickford recently got them for me
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
but I already have several here
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
and and in those
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
to start with the the most recent one
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uses the income shares
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
model which entitles the same level of
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures the child would have
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
received had the parents lived together
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
as I pointed out that's problem number
 
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
as I pointed out that's problem number
one

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire guideline system is
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
based on lifestyle not the actual
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
support needs of the child however
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
support needs can be used as a deviation
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
for low-income parents you'll see that
 
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
on page 107.
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
the analysis of the case File data found
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
a deviation rate of 61 percent among
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
divorce and
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
and uh parenting petitions
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire deviation rate is much
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
higher than that of other states I'm
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
reading this verbatim right from the
 
00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:11.270 align:start position:0%
reading this verbatim right from the
study

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
over half the deviations were known to
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
be due
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
to the parenting or caused by the
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
now in comparison the state does foster
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
care or the Social Security System phase
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
for the decisive apparent this
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
there's one fee is for the support not
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
for a lifestyle
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
so I just want to keep pointing that out
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
that's where we skewed
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
or the federal government forced us a
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
skew there
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
um does the government really have a
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
right to demand a parent exchange from
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
one parent to the other what would be
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary and not needed for the
 
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
support of children in a marriage when
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
we stop the courts from ordering College
 
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:01.130 align:start position:0%
we stop the courts from ordering College
expenses

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
in 2004 it was because married parents
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
are not required to do so therefore
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
neither should divorced separated or
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
widowed parents
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
in other words we treat them as a
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
we discriminate against divorced parents
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
is what we do
 
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation number six of the 22
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
review adopt a time-sharing adjustment
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
recognition number seven from the family
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
law task force
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
of 2004 Nina Gardner was our executive
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
director uh
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
cheered it rather
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
um this is the best thing we ever did
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
you got time we sat together we had
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
people from a court
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
um the Departments there and we came up
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
with several recommendations we got
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of it uh passed but one
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
thing didn't and that is from uh on page
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
9 and 12 States amend child support
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
statutes to deal with shared or split
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
residence Arrangements
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation number three from the
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines review of 2018.
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
that was the one before this one
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
um address shared parenting they even
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
sent us
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
an addendum in 2019 to use just for
 
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
shared parenting
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth College uh Kristen Smith
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be exased
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation number three from the
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
2009 New Hampshire child support
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines review we recommend New
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopt the Shared Parenting
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
adjustment currently used by Vermont
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
this involves multiplying the basic
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
order by 1.5 to account for the
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
additional fixed costs associated with
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
raising a child in two homes and
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
subtracting an amount directly
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
proportional to the fraction of time an
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
obligor spends with a child
 
00:52:02.049 --> 00:52:02.059 align:start position:0%
as measured in overnights
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
adopt a simple cross calculation method
 
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
for setting Awards in cases of exactly
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
equal shared parenting time or split
 
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.750 align:start position:0%
equal shared parenting time or split
custody

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
that was that was done by uh the
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
university the extension service did our
 
00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:26.420 align:start position:0%
review that time Dr Kalinowski and Dr uh
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
I can't remember first name Smith
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
from Durham
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
you just made that up he did The
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
Bullying uh statutes too
 
00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.150 align:start position:0%
Bullying uh statutes too
um

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
commissioned to study child support and
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
related child custody issues on December
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
1st of 2004 guidelines are skewed by
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture reports of
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
expenditures on children and by families
 
00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
due to the way they calculate housing
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
and transportation
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
in that case if someone has one child
 
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:00.260 align:start position:0%
then half the cost of the automobile
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
expenses and and payments
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
is retributed to a child and it's the
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
same thing with housing all of a sudden
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
if you have a house and you have one
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
child half the cost of the house so that
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me alimony moved Beyond support
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
to permitting the more dependent spouse
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
to become financially independent or to
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
have the same standard of living as
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
during the marriage and child support
 
00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
has also moved Beyond to become child
 
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.069 align:start position:0%
has also moved Beyond to become child
alimony

00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
keep in mind one parent must pay the
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
other for a standard of living or go to
 
00:53:39.059 --> 00:53:39.950 align:start position:0%
other for a standard of living or go to
jail

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
jail
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
but the other parent
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
is under no obligation to provide that
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
standard of living to the child
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when you create a
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
standard living thing
 
00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:52.370 align:start position:0%
standard living thing
um

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out it
 
00:53:54.599 --> 00:53:55.970 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out it
back

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
around 2004 I can remember exactly when
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
one or 2002 probably when I was here
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
serious mistakes can happen
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
I I was on the child and family law
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
committee at that time and I was trying
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
to understand the child support because
 
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
the statute said it was income shias
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
which is a model federal government told
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
us to we could use
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
but the guidelines were written around
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
percent of obligora
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
and I can remember asking Joan Williams
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
I said I don't get it your father's wow
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
I guess it's a kind of a hybrid thing
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
well it was a serious mistake and if you
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
go to the poor these things here they
 
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.849 align:start position:0%
go to the poor these things here they
say

00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
like guidelines are not
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
what the statute said
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a big whoops
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh on iPad
 
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.870 align:start position:0%
uh on iPad
um

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
one of the things I want to point out
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
further is there's been a few
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh Supreme Court decisions it was
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
Anderson and there was Silva most
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
recently this says
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
these things need to be decided by the
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
legislature they're not going to
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
continue to keep making deviations
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
when there's just a sad parenting issue
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
going on that the legislature needs to
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
deal with it our problem has not been
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
the child and family law committee so
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:23.930 align:start position:0%
 
care

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
are you nearing the end am I what are
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
you nearing the end of your presentation
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
yes I am good I'm sorry to hear you say
 
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.410 align:start position:0%
yes I am good I'm sorry to hear you say
that

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:32.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford you and I go
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
back to 19 the election of 1996 so I am
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
well conditioned to listen to your every
 
00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:43.450 align:start position:0%
well conditioned to listen to your every
word

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:43.460 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's right we started in a Judiciary
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
and we sat beside each other
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
and we were good classmates
 
00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
representing him with that I will
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.049 align:start position:0%
um
testimony

00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and do you have
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
um written a copy of that testimony
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
um that you could share with us that
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
because you're so succinct
 
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.410 align:start position:0%
because you're so succinct
representative

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford for taking my
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
question I was wondering if you have a
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
copy of actually the
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
study or report that you did in 2004
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
because I do see that the guidelines
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
were changed in 2005 and I think they
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
corrected kind of much of what you said
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
and then for some reason in 2013 this
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
statue was modified to say that there
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't be a deviation for shared split
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
parenting time and that the courts
 
00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.099 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily comply with it until
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
the Silva V Silva case
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
um was decided in 2018 and when that
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision was decided the
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
judges then
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
stopped deviating because like you know
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
it was confirmed that the statue says
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
that you can't so I'm wondering if
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
we could look at some of those
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations that you had because I'm
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
wondering if whom changed it in 2013
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of these recommendations
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
that you had already kind of looked into
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
the change that was made I think in 20
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
2013 was probably the guidelines
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
themselves to represent income shares no
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
no the change in 2013 is the is the
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
current change which states that you
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
can't make a deviation solely based on
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
shared slash split parenting time and it
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily as well enforced
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
until it was affirmed in the syllabi
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
Silva Supreme Court case somebody who
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
frequently comes in to our committee
 
00:58:02.569 --> 00:58:02.579 align:start position:0%
Vivian Gerard when that was decided in
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
2018 that's when
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
it was kind of effort but it was in 2013
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
that that was changed the the RSA was
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
changed to state that
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
the guidelines couldn't be changed just
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
because of split or shared parenting
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
time previously in 20 2005. let's just
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
say the guidelines can't be changed or
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
does it say that you that's the order
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
the support can't be
 
00:58:27.059 --> 00:58:28.390 align:start position:0%
the support can't be
uh

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
necessarily changed because of only
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
having a um
 
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.530 align:start position:0%
having a um
um

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
she had parenting time
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the they don't have to
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
change the court does not have to make a
 
00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.089 align:start position:0%
change the court does not have to make a
change

00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
as I recall
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right it says in considering
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
that the parenting schedule that can't
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
be like the sole reason for why that
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
they're making a deviation
 
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
it can't be the soul
 
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.549 align:start position:0%
it can't be the soul
yeah

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
yeah we didn't want to uh
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
actually we were expecting the course
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
they have deviation on these things but
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
we never really came up with a good set
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
of guidelines and yet year you know
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
study after study says you got to do it
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
we're only one out of
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
I think there's only nine states left
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
that hasn't done it
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh it this is a legislative action I'm
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
when I thought 13 it was actually before
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
that when I
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going off in a little different
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
direction when I discovered that we were
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
using percent of income uh we we did
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
change it uh to income shares the
 
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.809 align:start position:0%
change it uh to income shares the
guidelines

00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
um to do that I had Ed Morin who was the
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee file it rather
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
than in my name and it might look a
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
little inflammatory
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
and uh what we did was in in that case
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
was copied Vermont
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh I just thought I'd throw that in
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
this do you understand
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
on your question though about
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
so I was just asking if we could see the
 
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
report that you had had I know you
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
referenced it the 2004 report because I
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
think it you know I said it was a 2004
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
report well you had referenced it in
 
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
your testimony that you guys had done
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
this this study and it was subsequently
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
changed to to say that equal or
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
responsibilities shall not eliminate the
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
need for child support or modification
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the guidelines and I just wanted to
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
see your report because I think it was
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
in contradiction to this I just wanted
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
um perhaps excuse me perhaps
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative you could I have all the
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
reports that's terrific and let's um I
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
know you'd want to hear that so well I'm

which report it's in right now well
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
let's at this point let's just thank you
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%

establish exactly what information she
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
would like from your
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%

yes thank you very much for appearing
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
before I also have this on digital too
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
the family law task force uh
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
terrific I really appreciate that thank
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
good morning I hope we haven't kept you
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
waiting too long you have not and thank
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
my name is Ned Gordon and uh I had the
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
pleasure of serving as a circuit court
 
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.910 align:start position:0%
pleasure of serving as a circuit court
judge

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:33.859 align:start position:0%
uh having been appointed in 2005 and
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
volunteering in 2006 to serve in the
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
Family Division the newly created Family
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
Division under the Circuit Court
 
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.950 align:start position:0%
Division under the Circuit Court
the

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh and served there for 12 years until
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
my retirement and uh 12 years later so
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
for 12 years I did rule on Family
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
Division cases and
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
heard Family Division cases so I'm here
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
today to talk about neutral case
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation which is what I'm doing now
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
post retirement
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the court has uh long recognized
 
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
and the court has uh long recognized
that

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
the old standard trial procedure isn't
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best way to resolve
 
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.349 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best way to resolve
cases

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
that are based on familial relationships
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
and are highly emotional and so it has
 
01:03:32.289 --> 01:03:32.299 align:start position:0%
developed alternative dispute resolution
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
processes one of which is nce neutral
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
case evaluation but more frequently used
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
is mediation and I brought along with me
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
today Margaret Wang who is the
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the circuit court for
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution and so
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation but I thought
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
you might want to hear from her as well
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
with regard to the mediation if we have
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
time to do that today
 
01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:03.500 align:start position:0%
so neutral case evaluation
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for particularly cases
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
than dispute that are and going to end
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
up going to a trial or a final hearing
 
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
and they are generally post-discovery
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
after people have exchanged information
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
and they've been scheduled for trial or
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
final hearing and the parties agree and
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
to a neutral case evaluation going in
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
front of a retired jurist a someone who
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
has been deciding cases in the past to
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
attempt to resolve their case
 
01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
attempt to resolve their case
and

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's a period of time generally
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled for three hours period of time
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
where that retired judge such as myself
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
will hear from the parties
 
01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
maybe separate the parties hear from
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
them individually
 
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
and then try to give them an idea of how
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
a judge would decide their case
 
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.849 align:start position:0%
a judge would decide their case
and

01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
the question is can you can you do that
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you two things about Judges
 
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
and this is what I would tell everybody
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
about Judges first of all judges are not
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
problem solvers
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
judges are decision makers
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
I think that's one of the issues that
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
you probably should be addressing in
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
your committee and that is people come
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
to the family division with the
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
expectation that their problem is going
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
to be solved where basically what judges
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
do is decide decisions and they decide
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
decisions pretty mechanically
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
just like you've just heard about child
 
01:05:43.319 --> 01:05:44.329 align:start position:0%
just like you've just heard about child
support

01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
you have created laws that pretty much
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
establish how cases are going to be
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
decided so you establish a law with
 
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
regard to child support you a law regard
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
to how you apply alimony you have laws
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
with regard to property division you
 
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
have all these laws that you've
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
established there's also case law which
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
I just have to follow
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
and there are court rules that the
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
judges have to follow and there are best
 
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
practices there are protocols that
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
judges follow so by the time you do that
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
judging a case is a pretty mechanical
 
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
judging a case is a pretty mechanical
exercise

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
and so I think you can predict in many
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
cases how a case is going to be decided
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
the second thing you need to know about
 
01:06:28.079 --> 01:06:29.589 align:start position:0%
the second thing you need to know about
Judges

01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
Judges
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
is that they're human
 
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.710 align:start position:0%
is that they're human
and

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
they put you they put a robe on you as a
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
judge and they would give you the idea
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
that you're really smart and that you're
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
infallible but the fact is that judges
 
01:06:46.849 --> 01:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
are not infallible they're just as human
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
as anybody else and they do make
 
01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:51.250 align:start position:0%
as anybody else and they do make
mistakes

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:51.260 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.849 align:start position:0%
mistakes
but

01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
judges uh
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
there's a long process for correcting
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
those mistakes in many cases which is
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
the appeal process and uh
 
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.970 align:start position:0%
the appeal process and uh
so

01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the making decisions
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's a mechanical process and somewhat
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
predictable but because judges are human
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's not as predictable that elements
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
are predictable so every time you go in
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
front of a judge you sort of take your
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
chances there are different judges some
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
judges are very formal some judges are
 
01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:27.500 align:start position:0%
very friendly some judges
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
are detail-oriented analytical other
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
judges are very just expressive and so
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
you you take your chances and that's
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
what are you constantly hear from other
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys is you know it depends on who
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get from my judge today so
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
long and short so what happens at the
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
nce is you sit down with the parties you
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
hear what their interests are
 
01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:56.660 align:start position:0%
and you do your very best to to
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
determine how they would end up better
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
off because the fact is that if you
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
simply go through the process
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
mechanically neither party may end up in
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
the best situation they could be and by
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
a judge sitting down with them saying
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is how I think your case will be
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
decided now what's important to you
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
each party can then emphasize what they
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
would like to see happen
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
a for example is uh recently with a
 
01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
husband's biggest concern was saving his
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
retirement plan he did not want to give
 
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
up his retirement plan
 
01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.370 align:start position:0%
up his retirement plan
but

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:39.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
the wise biggest concern was she wanted
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
to have a steady income
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
so the long and the short is when if you
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
had just gone to a judge and the judge
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
decided that mechanically he would have
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
divided that retirement plan in half
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay and probably given alimony just
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
according to statute
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
but then at the end at the neutral case
 
01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.749 align:start position:0%
but then at the end at the neutral case
evaluation

01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
hearing from the parties what we could
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
do is say okay what we're going to do is
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
we're going to escalate the alimony
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
because that's really what the wife
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
wants is she needed to have a steady
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
income and he wanted to preserve so he
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
could preserve his retirement and they
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
the two parties end up better off than
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
they would have if they had just gone to
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
trial and gone before a judge
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
and that's a neutral case evaluation as
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
the idea that people can resolve their
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
case in a manner which both parties end
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
up or benefit from
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
and it works very well right now at
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
least as far as I'm concerned 50 percent
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
of the time we resolve the case we
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
settle the cases before they go to trial
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
it goes to
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh it and that saves the court time
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
saves the court money
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of expense
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
and you end up with a better result for
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
everybody for the court system
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
for the state and for the parties
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
I can talk add Margaret explain a little
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
bit about mediation as well and how
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
we're using the media if
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
before before we get to that
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Kota
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question on uh
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask so you said 50 of the
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
time you're able to resolve the cases I
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
is this neutral case evaluation being
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
offered in all of the course just
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
certain ones or
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
what's the current status with it is it
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
a you know a pilot program where it's
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
only being offered in certain courts
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
so it's offered Statewide
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
um currently all of our nces are
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
occurring in Concord probate
 
01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
occurring in Concord probate
um

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
it has been a robust service and it was
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
a more robust service prior to the
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic where we both had sitting and
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
retired judges doing neutral case
 
01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.810 align:start position:0%
retired judges doing neutral case
evaluations

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
um after the pandemic with the backlog
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
of cases all of our judicial resources
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
have been used to hear cases so as a
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
result the ADR office has been using
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
retired judges to do neutral case
 
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.410 align:start position:0%
retired judges to do neutral case
evaluations

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
um as such there are fewer neutral case
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
evaluations than was back in 2019 but
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
there are still I think around like
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
175 this year that are available should
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
is there a fee involved in
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
participating in this program
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
so for neutral case evaluation there is
 
01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so of the 175 cases that are
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
available is the demand greater than
 
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
available is the demand greater than
that

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
we have attorneys have asked us
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
um to increase the neutral case
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
and uh Madam chair Smith
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Margaret Huang and I am the
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%

coordinator for the New Hampshire
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
in this position I oversee 16 court
 
01:12:43.209 --> 01:12:43.219 align:start position:0%
connected alternative dispute resolution
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
or ADR programs across the Supreme
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
Superior and circuit courts
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
there are about 4 600 ADR sessions that
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
occur per year across these Court
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
connected programs we have two court
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
connected ADR programs that are
 
01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:02.540 align:start position:0%
available in divorce parenting cases
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
mediation and neutral case evaluation
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you to judge Gordon for inviting
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
me to talk about mediation
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
so judge Gordon gave you a description
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
of what neutral case evaluation looks
 
01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
like from the perspective of a judge or
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
an evaluator and I will give you an
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
overview of our mediation program from
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
the perspective of a program manager of
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
course if you have any nce questions
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
that are program related as well please
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask me or to ask me to talk
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
more about the nce program I would be
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:37.580 align:start position:0%
okay so what is mediation
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
mediation is an informal process in
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
which the parties meet with a certified
 
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
family mediator to work out decisions
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
relating to Parenting and divorce
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
mediation provides parents with a
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
collaborative environment in which to
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
make these decisions and as such
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
mediation gives parents an opportunity
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
to resolve matters in a way that
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns and interests of
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
both the parents and the child or
 
01:14:05.159 --> 01:14:07.130 align:start position:0%
both the parents and the child or
children

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
mediation is generally governed by three
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
major principles self-determination
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
impartiality and confidentiality
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
self-determination is the concept that
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
any decisions that the parties come to
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
should be voluntary and uncoerced the
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
mediator does not have any authority to
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
force the parties to come to a certain
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
resolution or any resolution
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
the role of the mediator is to work with
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
parties to explore what they care about
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
what their options are for meeting their
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
needs how these options may impact their
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
situation and to find areas of agreement
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
second is impartiality mediators are
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
neutral which means that they are not
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
partial towards or prejudiced against
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
any party and they should not have a
 
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:55.460 align:start position:0%
stake in the outcome and lastly
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality because mediation is
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
confidential anything that is said or
 
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
written during mediation cannot be
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
shared with the judge hearing the case
 
01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
or used in any further Court proceedings
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
mediations are confidential for the same
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
reasons that settlement negotiations are
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
confidential and inadmissible we want
 
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:17.540 align:start position:0%
people to be as open as they can be
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
should to try to reach resolution
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
without the fear that what they're going
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
to say is going to be used against them
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
should the case go back to court
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
for cases with children all parties are
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
referred to mediation unless there's a
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
statutory reason not to or if a
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
different avenue such as a hearing or a
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
case manager conference is more
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate for cases without children
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
parties are offered mediation at their
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
first court hearing and parties can
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
choose how they want the mediation to
 
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
occur whether it's over Zoom or in
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
person at the courthouse this way
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
parties choose the process that works
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
best for them whether it's mediating in
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
person because they may be uncomfortable
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
with technology or mediating over video
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
because they may have issues with
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation or be less able to take
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
time off work
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
at the date and time of mediation
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
mediation starts with the mediator
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
explaining the process and the ground
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
rules for participation
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
the mediator then leads parties through
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
a discussion around topics such as
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
property division time with children
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
decision making and transportation
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
if the parties come to an agreement on a
 
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
topic the mediator will keep track of
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
the agreements that are reached again
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
mediation is a voluntary process so the
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
parties may come to an agreement on all
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
of the issues some of the issues or not
 
01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:40.010 align:start position:0%
of the issues some of the issues or not
agree

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
after the mediation session if the case
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
settles either the parties or the
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
mediator will submit the required
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
documents to the court
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
if the case does not settle parties can
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
either agree to ongoing mediation or
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
return the case back to court
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
as judge Gordon said judges are decision
 
01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.570 align:start position:0%
as judge Gordon said judges are decision
makers

01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
makers
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
in mediation parents can be problem
 
01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.410 align:start position:0%
in mediation parents can be problem
solvers

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
solvers
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
at a minimum mediation provides a
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
facilitative collaborative space for
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
parties to negotiate with each other and
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
work out solutions to problems that may
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
have arisen
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
it is a process that has a lower barrier
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
to entry to court for example you don't
 
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
need to know the rules of evidence in
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
order to participate effectively
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
and critically it allows for legally
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
irrelevant interests to be important
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
judges are concerned with the facts that
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
will assist them in making a decision
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
and that may not be what is most
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
important to the parties
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
in mediation parties are able to talk
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
about what is most important to them
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
even if it's not relevant in regards to
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
at its best mediation strives to Foster
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
understanding help people feel heard and
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
assist people with generating creative
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
and tailored Solutions
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
every family is different and so every
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
mediation and every mediated agreement
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
will be different
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
that being said mediation is not
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate for every case
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
RSA 461a7 and RSA 45815c list out some
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which the court may
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
choose not to order mediation
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
they include a showing of undue hardship
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
an agreement between the parties for
 
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
different ADR procedures
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
an allegation of abuser neglect a
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
finding of alcoholism or drug abuse an
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
allegation of serious psychological or
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
and both statutes state that the court
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
shall not order mediation if there is a
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
finding of domestic violence as defined
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
in RSA 173 B1 unless all parties agree
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I will try to finish up quickly
 
01:18:58.209 --> 01:18:58.219 align:start position:0%
um in 2021
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
3228 mediation sessions were held
 
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
about 38 percent were ongoing so they
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
needed an additional mediation session
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
28 did not settle seven percent
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
partially settled and 22 percent fully
 
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
settled that being said the outcome of a
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
mediation is not necessarily an
 
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
indicator for whether it's successful
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
a settled mediation can save parties
 
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:21.950 align:start position:0%
a settled mediation can save parties
time

01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
and expense of going on with the court
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
process and can reduce the court the
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
workload of a court but a partially
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
settled mediation also saves the court
 
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
time and can reduce say a two-day trial
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
to a one-day trial and can help the
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
parties figure out what they actually
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
disagree about or what they need more
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
information on
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
going mediation means that there are
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
additional topics that need a longer
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
discussion and the parties are willing
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
to come back to the table to have that
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
discussion with each other or that they
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
need to come to a temporary agreement
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
that they will try out and then go back
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
to mediation to tweak
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
and a mediation that does not settle can
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
clarify for parties the need to go to
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
court the need for Discovery to be
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
completed that mediation is not the
 
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
right Avenue for them or that they have
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
simply exercised their right to
 
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.630 align:start position:0%
simply exercised their right to
self-determination

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
mediation is successful if it provides
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
parties with a quality process
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the 129 feedback responses we've
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
received from parties going through
 
01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:27.380 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting mediation
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
97.7 percent of people felt like the
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
mediator explained the process answered
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
all of their questions were treated
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
fairly and with respect
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
and lastly my last point is that 90.7 of
 
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
people who responded said they would use
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
mediation again if they needed to thank
 
01:20:45.659 --> 01:20:47.390 align:start position:0%
mediation again if they needed to thank
you

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you uh very much for that of the
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
129 responses what does that represent
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the total number of
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
mediation so that were conducted
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
probably a fairly minimal percentage
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
however all parties are offered the
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide their feedback at
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
the end of mediation so these are just
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that we've received thank you I
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
I understand that and I am quite taken
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
by your
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic support of this effort but
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
it helps us if we can
 
01:21:26.219 --> 01:21:28.010 align:start position:0%
it helps us if we can
really

01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
really
um

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
if we have just the facts ma'am and 129
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
responses is fine but one must wonder if
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
the people who responded are the very
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
people who are happiest
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the process and the rest aren't so
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
when I ask you that question it's not in
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
any challenging or hostile way it's just
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
to better evaluate and related to that
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of mediation
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
mediation is currently 300 per case
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
which is a hundred and fifty dollars per
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
party however effective July 1st um with
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was passed by the
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court mediation will increase to
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
450 dollars per case or 225 dollars per
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
party the increase is a result of the
 
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
fact that the mediation fee has not
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
increased for the past 20 years and
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
um to make it commensurate with what the
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
gal and uh defense attorney increase has
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you this
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
is uh very helpful
 
01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.189 align:start position:0%
is uh very helpful
um

01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
in mediation are are they had had uh uh
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
Mr Gordon stated
 
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
um the judges will give them an
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
anticipation of what he believes the
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
result will be uh in mediation is that
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
also the case
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that's a great question no
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
it's not so
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
um nce has that added component of
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
providing an evaluation but the
 
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
mediation does not
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay and uh fall off I may the uh data
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
is there data kept on what how many
 
01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
hours possibly were saved
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh with a potential mediation is is that
 
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
data kept somewhere court hours ever
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
saved I'm not sure but I could see if we
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
have that today all right thank you
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative McBeth
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question it's
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
great to see you um representative
 
01:23:48.179 --> 01:23:49.250 align:start position:0%
great to see you um representative
Gordon

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
Gordon
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
um how do we the neutral case
 
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
evaluations you say it's dropped the the
 
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
amount we're able to offer
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
um what would be what's needed to bring
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
that up to pre-covered levels or even to
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
address all the cases now
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
that that might require it I think you
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
said that there were
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
146 or seven and I think we heard
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that they're 30 000
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
cases filed each year in New Hampshire
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
family court so how could we maybe make
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
those numbers meet better
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
I think that in order to expand the
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
program we would need additional staff
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
in order to process that paperwork and
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
to really implement it day to day on the
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
ground you know getting files to the
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
right places for example
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
processing forms Etc I also think that
 
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:41.780 align:start position:0%
we would need more judicial resources
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
like I had said all of our judges are
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
currently sitting and so having more
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
resources would mean that they would
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
have more space to be able to engage in
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think I'm Madam chair our attorneys
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
present at nces or mediation both
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes so attorneys always have the
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in both okay
 
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
and and that's been and with regard to
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
mediation you have you see many
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
non-represented parties in the mediation
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
but in the nces it's rare to see a
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
non-represented party usually attorneys
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
because you're getting to the point
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
where you're going to trial
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and ma'am how do I
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
pronounce your last name
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's Huang Wang that's like I heard the
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
alternative I want to make sure I had it
 
01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.090 align:start position:0%
alternative I want to make sure I had it
right

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh in previous testimony we had on May
 
01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.930 align:start position:0%
uh in previous testimony we had on May
16th

01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
16th
 
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
the uh comments were made I'm going for
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
my notes right now that the Rules of
 
01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.330 align:start position:0%
my notes right now that the Rules of
Evidence

01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
are not in play in Family Court
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
but you've just you referred in your
 
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:03.470 align:start position:0%
but you've just you referred in your
commentary

01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence what's correct
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I misspoke it was an
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
example well it shows I'm actually
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
paying attention to it I'm good thank
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
you okay just a follow-up
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
um for his honor
 
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh with your 12-year experience
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
and haven't been the authority having
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction which is redundant
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
what is not happening in Family Court
 
01:26:34.209 --> 01:26:34.219 align:start position:0%
since you left that brings us to this
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
tribunal if you will on improving what
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
takes place for our citizens who come
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
two minutes that's a big question for
 
01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:49.460 align:start position:0%
two minutes I can uh I can tell you uh
 
01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh a few thoughts
 
01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.450 align:start position:0%
uh a few thoughts
um

01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
it gets to the issue of the court is not
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
a problem solver the court is a decision
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
maker I think many people come to court
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
with the expectation that their problem
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be solved
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
so if I have a recent case where the 14
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
year old kid
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
parents married 20 years they have a kid
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
mom's got a new boyfriend they've
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
separated and this kid is just torn
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
apart has
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
just emotionally
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
traumatized over this divorce
 
01:27:34.199 --> 01:27:36.010 align:start position:0%
traumatized over this divorce
and

01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:36.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
is upset with Mom upset with dad doesn't
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
like Dad because she doesn't really have
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
a relationship with Dad dad hasn't been
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
much in her life and and they come to
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
court the parents seem to be coming to
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
court with the idea that the Court's
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
going to solve that problem for them
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the court isn't going to solve that
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
problem there are some problems the
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
court cannot solve and it can make an
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
effort to solve those problems it can
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
you know advocate for counseling it can
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
do certain things but there are certain
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
problems in Kansas but people have
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
expectations that the court is going to
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
do more
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
then the court can actually do in many
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
cases and unfortunately
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the other the other issue is
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh these are these are huge emotional
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
issues that people are involved with and
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
I can tell you sitting on the guardian
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
at lighting board for example
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
um people come in and they believe they
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
believe 100 that their right with regard
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
to what their kid needs and and that's
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
great you know and a parent you want a
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
parent to be enthusiastic but there are
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
different points of view on what's in a
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
child's best interest and sometimes a
 
01:28:51.610 --> 01:28:51.620 align:start position:0%
judge will have
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
a different view as to what's in a
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
child's best interest
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
a guardian Elida might have a different
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
view of what it was in the trial's best
 
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:00.590 align:start position:0%
view of what it was in the trial's best
interest

01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
and in many cases that parent who's so
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
invested emotionally whatever else can't
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
see that there are different points of
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
view or people can have different ideas
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
of what's in the child's best interest
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
so they view that difference as bias
 
01:29:22.930 --> 01:29:22.940 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a different point of view
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
or or or the fact that somebody has just
 
01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:28.699 align:start position:0%
got it wrong
 
01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that I think that's certainly one of
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
the issues that you have to deal with I
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
think there's another issue with regard
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
and uh you know the court system might
 
01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:41.060 align:start position:0%
know let me even talk about this but
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
we we had a system at one point in time
 
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
where we had marital Masters all of them
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
had practiced family law
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
and uh were hired because they were
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
family law practitioners and became
 
01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:01.100 align:start position:0%
marital Masters
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
and knew the law practiced the law and
 
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
did what they wanted to do
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
now we're appointing judges
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
in many cases that have had no
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
experience at all in family law who have
 
01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
been prosecutors defense attorneys
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
administrative judges contract reviewers
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and and putting a robe on them and
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
having sending them out to do family law
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that's uh I think that's an
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
issue that we should look at and it's
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
not that they might not be capable of
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
doing it but the question is do they
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
want to do it I know that there are some
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
judges that aren't really enthusiastic
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
about doing family law and it's probably
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
the hardest thing as a judge that you do
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
as a family law cases because
 
01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:50.270 align:start position:0%
as a family law cases because
um

01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
unless you have the nce or the mediation
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
and you work through these things
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that the trial system doesn't
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
work is because there are winners and
 
01:31:00.239 --> 01:31:01.629 align:start position:0%
work is because there are winners and
losers

01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
losers
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
and when you and that's that's the
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
that's the problem with the trial system
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why nce works that's why
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
mediation works even with the nces we we
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
settle 50 of the cases but the other
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
cases are well on their way to being
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
settled or resolved because what you've
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
done is if there are 10 issues in the
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
case you resolved eight of them in the
 
01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
nce and they're just two left that need
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be addressed by a judge someplace
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so those are those are some of my my
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
thoughts if if you were gonna if you
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
were going to have a judge to be a
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
family if you were going to have if you
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
were going to hire somebody
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh for a job you would hire somebody who
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
was experienced and qualified
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that we should have
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
judges if you were going to hire if you
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
wanted a judge to be a family court
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
judge and I think that was the intention
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
I you know I was one of the sponsors of
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
the original Family Division Bill and
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
with the idea that one family one judge
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
and this was going to be a judge that
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:16.940 align:start position:0%
and one follow-up Madam chair
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Joanna for that comment on
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
that being stated what was provided to
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
us under the this document that was
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
given to us
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
it states here the parties shall have
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
attended mediation prior to an nce does
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
that stipulate that that process is made
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
available to
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
um the parties coming before the court
 
01:32:39.169 --> 01:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
system prior to an action being
 
01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:40.550 align:start position:0%
system prior to an action being
initiated

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they know they haven't that
 
01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.570 align:start position:0%
that they know they haven't that
option

01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
no option that that's the process
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh I'll have somebody else can answer
 
01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh I'll have somebody else can answer
that

01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
um so nce is typically offered at the
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
later stages of a case and so mediation
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
needs to have already occurred or the
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
case is inappropriate for mediation and
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
we also ask for Discovery to be complete
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
so that it's the best use of the judge's
 
01:33:05.639 --> 01:33:06.770 align:start position:0%
so that it's the best use of the judge's
time

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
most cases will be given the option of
 
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
mediation at the very first stage right
 
01:33:16.729 --> 01:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
first appearance first court appearance
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
um so we just ask that they have either
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
completed mediation or again it's not
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
appropriate before trying nce
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay just one point of clarification
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh that being said in in and also
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
writing down what the honor you know the
 
01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:36.020 align:start position:0%
owner had stated what regarding bias
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
set a stage of Express or implied bias
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
on fair treatment of either party when
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
mediation is taken off the table before
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that is provided
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think who makes that decision it's is
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
it the parties or is it the does it
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
start at the uh at the judge
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.649 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so mediation is determined to be uh
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate by Statute so RSA 461 A7
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
and RSA 45815c
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
um it would be a the judge who is
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
hearing the case would probably rule on
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not mediation is appropriate
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that being said the person who does
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
the neutral case evaluation
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
um is not the judge hearing the case it
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
is a different judge who typically does
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
not have any knowledge of the case prior
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
to going through nce with the parties
 
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you madam chair if
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
I can just add in the nces there's
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
specifically an agreement first of all
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
the parties have to agree that they want
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
to do nce and second uh they sign an
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
agreement where
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
the the judge who does the nce cannot be
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
subpoenaed to any of the information
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
that came out of the NC it's completely
 
01:35:03.719 --> 01:35:09.110 align:start position:0%
that came out of the NC it's completely
confidential

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
honorable Gordon for taking my question
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of experience in all of
 
01:35:18.649 --> 01:35:18.659 align:start position:0%
this so I'm wondering and you don't have
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
to answer this question but if you don't
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
mind sharing your opinion if you could
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
make any changes what three changes
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
would you potentially make that might
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
have what you think might be the biggest
 
01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:35.540 align:start position:0%
you know most positively impactful
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
are you changes to what the Family
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
Division as a whole you mean the whole
 
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
process as a whole family Division and
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
and that you know as a whole yeah well
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
and and if I could
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
think about their two Avenues one is the
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
legislature is suggesting to the court
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
changes that the court could make and
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
the other is the legislature taking
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
yeah you may have 30 seconds to think
 
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:36:29.169 --> 01:36:29.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
they were there I don't know there's
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
there's a few things I I guess one one
 
01:36:34.739 --> 01:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
there's a few things I I guess one one
is

01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.970 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
I I think there are two things one is
 
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
making sure you have the the resources
 
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
that you need to get the job done
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
and right now I don't believe there are
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
adequate resources to do that
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
particularly with regard to Staffing
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
even more so I think than judging from
 
01:36:58.990 --> 01:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
that you're really the staffing issues
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
are critical
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
I've seen orders for that
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
have been ruled on and then not sent out
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
for two or three weeks later and that's
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
just not acceptable when you have
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you've got families
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
and dealing with children and and these
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
are critical issues to families and it
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
needs to happen and so they need the
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
resources and I think the other issue is
 
01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:32.510 align:start position:0%
resources and I think the other issue is
allocation

01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
of resources I think uh you know the
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
whole concept between the Family
 
01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:39.659 align:start position:0%
Division when we
 
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:43.340 align:start position:0%
created the original
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
pilot program in Rockingham County up in
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
Grafton County was you know that we were
 
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
going to make this
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to make the system better
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
and we were going to have one judge one
 
01:37:56.219 --> 01:37:57.350 align:start position:0%
and we were going to have one judge one
family

01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.229 align:start position:0%
family
and

01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
consistency between
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
consistency and rulings between the
 
01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.410 align:start position:0%
consistency and rulings between the
families

01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:07.270 align:start position:0%
families
um

01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
guess I would like to see that happened
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
and that the people who were doing the
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
cases are people who want to hear the
 
01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.490 align:start position:0%
cases are people who want to hear the
cases

01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh that and who are qualified the most
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
qualified people to hear the cases as
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of questions one of them
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
is incredibly naive
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
no I can't believe that
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:51.659 align:start position:0%
is there any state in the United States
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
which does not use the judicial system
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
to resolve issues
 
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.709 align:start position:0%
to resolve issues
um

01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.719 --> 01:39:05.930 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean there aren't any I'm
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.750 align:start position:0%
is there
any

01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:39:32.770 --> 01:39:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the process of assigning judges to
 
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.649 align:start position:0%
from the process of assigning judges to
other

01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know the
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
answer to that I
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
there was there was a time when
 
01:40:18.719 --> 01:40:22.010 align:start position:0%
there was there was a time when
the

01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
when I was first appointed I was
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
appointed as the presiding judge of the
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
Franklin District Court
 
01:40:27.719 --> 01:40:29.030 align:start position:0%
Franklin District Court
so

01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
and there were other judges who
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
were appointed in that way and they were
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
district court judges and
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
like me they were given the option of
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
hearing Family Division cases and many
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
of those judges decided
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
that they didn't want to hear Family
 
01:40:51.169 --> 01:40:51.179 align:start position:0%
Division cases and so they didn't hear
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
Family Division cases
 
01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.390 align:start position:0%
Family Division cases
which

01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
and so then you what you did with that
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
sort of narrowed down the pool so you
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
only had judges who wanted to hear
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
Family Division here cases hearing them
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
but now I think it appears everybody's
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
appointed with the understanding that
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
they will hear Family Division cases
 
01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.270 align:start position:0%
they will hear Family Division cases
um

01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know the answer to that I
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think you'd have to answer have talked
 
01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
I think you'd have to answer have talked
to somebody

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
to somebody
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
with some Authority
 
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:29.450 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
with all due respect depends upon how
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
you define Authority
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
and in this case I'm asking a person who
 
01:41:40.729 --> 01:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
in my mind has the authority to make
 
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
informed decisions and that's why I ask
 
01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
informed decisions and that's why I ask
you

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer let me if if if
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
you uh you know basically judge
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
assignment is uh uh you know judges can
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
be assigned to different types of cases
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to reassign judges to
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
specific types of cases you could do
 
01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:03.050 align:start position:0%
specific types of cases you could do
that

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
it I think it
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
it cuts down somewhat on efficiency to
 
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
do that but you
 
01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
become by doing specialization you cut
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
down maybe on some efficiency but at the
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
same time
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
can end up with a better product too but
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's just my thought
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
do you see a problem of geography
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
in all this I mean some courts are going
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
that are family court cases and some
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
courts I imagine have many fewer I mean
 
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
courts I imagine have many fewer I mean
uh

01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.689 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:51.500 align:start position:0%
that might mean that judges have to
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
be in the Circuit Court have to actually
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
have a circuit in the way they did in
 
01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
could I ask you to take off your neutral
 
01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
case evaluation hat
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and put on the gal hack
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
when you appeared before us a number of
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
weeks ago you gave some very helpful
 
01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:32.990 align:start position:0%
weeks ago you gave some very helpful
testimony

01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
since then this committee has heard from
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
any number of people about a number of
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
issues and one of them has to do
 
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
with how in fact g-a-l
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
is working now first question in terms
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
of your role
 
01:43:55.810 --> 01:43:55.820 align:start position:0%
are you involved
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively in what as a layperson I
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
would call the casa component
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
as compared with
 
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
component I said on the I said as a
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
board member on the guardian of Litem
 
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
board a public member
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
appointed to serve on the guardian
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
lighting board
 
01:44:22.199 --> 01:44:24.050 align:start position:0%
lighting board
and

01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
I we
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
all guarding that items are subject to
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
the guardian that light and board that
 
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
includes private Guardian ad items and
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
Casa Guardian items there is a
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh there are there is
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
a mou with regard to Casa in the manner
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
in which
 
01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:53.930 align:start position:0%
in which
um

01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh Casa is addressed only because Casa
 
01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
does its own training
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we do training for Guardian level
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
items but Casa does its own training it
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
does its own supervision and so
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I think the last I heard
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the full time in the 20 some odd
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
years the guardian that light on board
 
01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:23.540 align:start position:0%
has been in effect we have had two
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
formal complaints against Casa Guardian
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you We Have Heard
 
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
thank you We Have Heard
um

01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and it is hard to know if this
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
reflects a pattern or if it's
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrat we just don't know
 
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
um that there there have been uh
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
occasions where
 
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.810 align:start position:0%
occasions where
um

01:45:52.810 --> 01:45:52.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
a particular judge favors
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
a particular gal and they establish a
 
01:46:01.679 --> 01:46:03.890 align:start position:0%
a particular gal and they establish a
relationship

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.109 align:start position:0%
relationship
um

01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.119 --> 01:46:07.629 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
might at least an appearance result in
 
01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:13.750 align:start position:0%
might at least an appearance result in
um

01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
the appearance of uh
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh unfairness or favoritism in terms of
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
what that gal
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
might advise
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
a bad is that something that you see
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
might be a problem
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
do I see it as a problem I guess no what
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
what I do see is that
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
you have a universe of guardian that
 
01:46:46.619 --> 01:46:49.609 align:start position:0%
you have a universe of guardian that
items

01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
I think as we discussed at the last time
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
I was here you can't teach common sense
 
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.090 align:start position:0%
I was here you can't teach common sense
and

01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
what happens is that you uh uh in your
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
particular and in your particular area
 
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
there'll be a limited number of Guardian
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
of items who want to serve your area
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
because for convenience purposes
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
and of that pool of those limited
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
Guardian Adel items you find that some
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps appear more competent than
 
01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.370 align:start position:0%
perhaps appear more competent than
others

01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
or some appear to have particular skills
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
that would be better for particular
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
cases than others
 
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
cases than others
so

01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
as a judge you tend to appoint Guardian
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
Adel items in whom you have a great deal
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
of confidence in that will do a good job
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that means that some guardian and
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
items get appointed a lot more than
 
01:47:49.739 --> 01:47:50.930 align:start position:0%
items get appointed a lot more than
others

01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
and I think that's pretty typical uh
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
situation as opposed to just randomly
 
01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
um again in in the private
 
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
do you see a problem related to the cost
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
of a gal in that one party
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
or the other might be paying
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
for the GAO yeah I
 
01:48:28.739 --> 01:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
for the GAO yeah I
um

01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes I think there's it creates a problem
 
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh you do do I think that Guardian Ad
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
Litem has a obligation
 
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
to be independent regardless of who pays
 
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.850 align:start position:0%
to be independent regardless of who pays
yes

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:45.109 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
do I think it creates a issue with
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
regard to perception yes or I think it
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
it does create an issue with regard to
 
01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.450 align:start position:0%
it does create an issue with regard to
perception

01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
perception
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
that Guardian that litem
 
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
has a duty to be independent and to make
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
an independent ruling regardless
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
they think the I think
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
part of what the issue is is if one
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
person if let's say in a thing the the
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
one one of one of the parties either the
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
husband or the wife or the father or the
 
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
mother I should say in those types of
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
cases says no I want to have a guardian
 
01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
that light him and I'll pay for the
 
01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:31.340 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem
 
01:49:34.729 --> 01:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
well why would why would they volunteer
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
to do that they because they think
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
they think that
 
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
the guardian idea might look more
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
favorably upon them if if they if they
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
didn't think that the guardian item was
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
going to look favorably upon them they
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't want to have one so
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
I think it creates this issue with
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
regard to
perception

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
perception
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
if I could just one more and then
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the practice in any
 
01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
other states of um how the financial
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
cost of a gal is handled I'm not thank
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Macbeth
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
um so judge Gordon I wanted to ask you a
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
question that something you were your
 
01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:28.139 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier about the family court
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
judges want to be there what is I know
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
there are some counties that have the
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
complex Family Division how many
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
counties have those and
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
how do you perceive that should all of
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
them have it is that working well
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
I have no clue I don't know the answer
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
to that hey thank you
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and then the other question I had had
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
to do with representative McMahon's
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
question or
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
um this um issue of irrelevant issues
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
coming into mediation or neutral case
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation could could you kind of
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
explain that it's it's really a Time
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
issue this isn't a evidence or Rules of
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
Evidence issue it's
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
isn't it that judges can only consider
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
what's in a statute so things that
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
aren't relevant to the parties aren't
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
considered but in a mediation or a
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation all factors can
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
be considered so it really isn't a
 
01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:18.659 align:start position:0%
whether the Rules of Evidence apply in
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
family cases or not it has to do with
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
what the statute and case law says as to
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
what the judge can look at right well uh
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
even even when the Rules of Evidence uh
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
aren't applied aren't applied they are
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
applied they're just not strictly
 
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
applied in all cases and but the
 
01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:42.830 align:start position:0%
applied in all cases and but the
the

01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.390 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
the neutral case evaluation there's a
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
big difference between you know you have
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
the mediation and the and the mediators
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
there and they're just trying to have
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
people come together and they they're
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
trying to talk through the issues and
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
whatever else the one thing about the
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is great is
 
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
because you know I can actually
 
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
tell people what I think you know uh
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
personally where where they ought to go
 
01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:15.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of resolving their case and you
 
01:52:15.659 --> 01:52:16.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of resolving their case and you
know

01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
just yeah
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
just a case yesterday uh you know
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
fighting over five hundred dollars
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and say you know you're going to
 
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
fight over the you know everything that
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
came down to 500 and say if you're
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
fighting over five hundred dollars you
 
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't you you leave here today you're
 
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
fighting over 500 you're going to go to
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
your next hearing and spend two thousand
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
dollars at your next hearing so get this
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
done and which is not something that a
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
mediator would be able to do but the
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation you can be
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
really strong uh which I think is really
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
helpful you can you know you'd love to
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
be that way in the courtroom uh many
 
01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.689 align:start position:0%
be that way in the courtroom uh many
times

01:52:59.689 --> 01:52:59.699 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.669 align:start position:0%
any other
questions

01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:53:04.679 --> 01:53:07.870 align:start position:0%
questions
um

01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:10.790 align:start position:0%
what happens
um

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
if the parties cannot afford uh in
 
01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:17.719 align:start position:0%
mediation what would now be
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
225 dollars each
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
um we have three streams of financial
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
assistance one is the access and
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
visitation grant that we receive from
 
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
the board from DHHS
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
um the other is the ADR fund
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
um so one was established by Supreme
 
01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
Court rule 48b that one we call fund
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
without kids because it applies to cases
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
without children
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and that if you're essentially at 200
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the federal property line or below
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and then the other is establish live
 
01:53:55.129 --> 01:53:55.139 align:start position:0%
461 A7 and we colloquially call it fund
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
with kids because it applies for fun
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
cases with children and that one however
 
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
has a repayment component to it it has
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
the same standard of 200 federal poverty
 
01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:06.050 align:start position:0%
the same standard of 200 federal poverty
line

01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and there's a current bill SB 129
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
that will remove that repayment
 
01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:12.890 align:start position:0%
that will remove that repayment
requirement

01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
so that all three streams of financial
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
assistance that parties can receive you
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
know there's not just one that requires
 
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.890 align:start position:0%
know there's not just one that requires
repayment

01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
like you have oh yes one more here
 
01:54:30.649 --> 01:54:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I know that you
 
01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
said that the cost for mediation was
 
01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
going to be going up to 450 on July 1st
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of neutral case
 
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.490 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of neutral case
evaluation

01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is free
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
consider that an asset not a debit
 
01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:55.970 align:start position:0%
consider that an asset not a debit
um

01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much for your time
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
we might want to come back and ask you
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
other questions because we are in the
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
learning mode and we do very much
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate your counsel thank you
 
01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.350 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair Miss Duncan did
 
01:55:15.119 --> 01:55:17.330 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Miss Duncan did
you

01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:24.169 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah I I think probably not
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
at this moment although if you have
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
something to say we would very much like
 
01:55:34.810 --> 01:55:34.820 align:start position:0%
to hear from it at the moment we do have
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh some cards uh
 
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I think the first one that was
 
01:55:57.649 --> 01:55:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca Hutchins I'm from
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
Dover New Hampshire I appreciate the
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I would like to
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
address the need for a parenting time
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
adjustment in our child support laws the
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
current laws do not take this into
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
consideration a little background about
 
01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
me I'm a mom of two my son is nine my
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
daughter is about to turn 15.
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have a shared two two three parenting
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
plan my divorce was Final in 2018.
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
I had been the higher earner throughout
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
our 14-year marriage so I'm the obligor
 
01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:39.260 align:start position:0%
in the child support calculation
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
high conflict cases drag on and on and
 
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
cost so much in the form of time money
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
energy and relationships it becomes
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
about money not about what's best for
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
the two families since there's no
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
parenting time adjustment in our laws
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
high conflict parents continue to battle
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
in court to squeeze out the last penny
 
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
parents nerves are high our bank
 
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
accounts are low and we all want to just
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
be enjoying our kids
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
since my separation we've seen at least
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
four different mediators several of
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
those for multiple sessions we've never
 
01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.139 align:start position:0%
reached an agreement through mediation
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
there was one time I made an agreement
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
outside of mediators and attorneys after
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
my ex's my ex lost his job
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
the agreement I made in 2019 was not in
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
my favor it was well above what I could
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
afford or was equitable
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
but because my anxiety was so high I
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
caved to avoid another another Court
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
battle I knew I just couldn't handle it
 
01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
emotionally or financially and then also
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
continue to support two households in
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
2020 just after 16 months of making that
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
agreement I lost my job during the covet
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
economy I asked my ex for some Grace
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
with child support while I was
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
unemployed and he was working full-time
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
we couldn't reach an agreement outside
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
of Court seven months after I lost my
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
job the court did Issue a temporary
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
relief in child support
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
there wasn't even a conversation that we
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
could engage in about how much time I
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
was spending with the children because
 
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm the obligor and the law states equal
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
or approximately equal parenting
 
01:58:16.729 --> 01:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
residential responsibilities in and of
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
itself shall not eliminate the need for
 
01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:20.780 align:start position:0%
child support and shall not be itself
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
shall not by itself constitute grounds
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
for an adjustment
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
in early 2021 we went back to court I
 
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
had just gotten a new job the highest
 
01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
paying job I had ever had
 
01:58:35.089 --> 01:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
I represented myself I had only been
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
working there for less than two months
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
when we had our hearing
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
at our uni as our uniform support order
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
was received about that same time I
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
realized I was suffering from complex
 
01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
PTSD I also found myself in a very
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly toxic work situation I ended
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
up leaving that job
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
and yet I couldn't go back to court to
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
change the order
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
for the next year I made forty thousand
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
dollars less than what my order said I
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
made and I still paid over fifteen
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in child support monthly
 
01:59:08.410 --> 01:59:08.420 align:start position:0%
as well as the amount of our deviation
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
425 dollars monthly to direct child
 
01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.070 align:start position:0%
425 dollars monthly to direct child
expenses

01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
in 2022 I tried to change our order
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
outside of Court including mediation
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
mediation does not work for high
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
conflict cases in this particular uh
 
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
shared parenting situations I've been in
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
another Court battle for over a year
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get my my support order
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
adjusted I've taken thirty thousand
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars out of retirement to pay my
 
01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
bills and to try to keep my credit score
 
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
from tanking as well as taking out a
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
second mortgage you can imagine what I
 
01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
was feeling when my ex recently pulled
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
up in a brand new truck
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of background to help you
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
understand some of the high conflict
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
cases that are being seen in our courts
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'm here to discuss how the the current
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
child support laws don't support
 
01:59:59.689 --> 01:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
co-parenting relationships in my case
 
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
this is particular for high Con in my
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
case and this is particularly for high
 
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
conflict cases and yet it is required
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
that divorced parents attend a child
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
impact seminar which encourages a strong
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
co-parenting relationship the New
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire system both encourages
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
co-parenting and yet does not do so from
 
02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
a finite Financial aspect it's both
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
confusing and Incredibly difficult to
 
02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
confusing and Incredibly difficult to
navigate

02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
the last four-year Child Support
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
guideline Studies have three have shared
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
three main recommendations we've been
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
talking about those today update the
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines tables to reflect the actual
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
cost of child rearing
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
increase the self-support reserve and
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
adopt a formula for Shared Parenting
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
that means for a minimum of eight years
 
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
it has been known that a shared
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
parenting formula is needed in our state
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
we need legislation to help shared
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
parenting families
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
my personal situation leads me to
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
support the need for a shared parenting
 
02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:03.659 align:start position:0%
formula yet I'm not only interested in
 
02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
solving this for myself I want to help
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
create legislation that's fair for more
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
than just my own situation
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
we need to work together to create this
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that takes these studies
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations into consideration we
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
need to come together to support
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
co-parenting and reduce conflict and
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
time and Co in court I'm confident that
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
we can create legislation that doesn't
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
divide but instead pulls parents
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
co-parents together for the betterment
 
02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:34.139 align:start position:0%
of our children in Split households
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
let's get creative let's work together
 
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
if the law is fair for both obligor and
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
obligee in shared parenting situations
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
we can eliminate much of the high
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
conflict cases that bog down the family
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna wrap it up
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
can I have 30 seconds
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
thank you hire earners won't feel taken
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of and both households will
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
have enough funds to support our
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
children I want to see legislation that
 
02:02:06.169 --> 02:02:06.179 align:start position:0%
works for the greater good of all split
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire it needs to
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
start with the parenting time
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
adjustments and a livable self-support
 
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
Reserve thank you
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that was very
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
helpful and very specific do you have a

that's there
 
02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
that's there
um

02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record I'm
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
Susan Duncan and I've had the honor of
 
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
serving as chairperson of the Guardian
 
02:03:03.169 --> 02:03:03.179 align:start position:0%
Ad Litem board and I just wanted to
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
respond to your questions
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
um some of this came up before Ned was
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
appointed he wasn't appointed to join
 
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
the board until after he left the house
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
um there was a very tragic
 
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
um horribly conflicted instance that
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
happened with the judge who was
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
appointing a favorite Guardian Ad Litem
 
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
very good friend fortunately she has
 
02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
been removed is no longer a judge the
 
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
board got a number of complaints about
 
02:03:35.089 --> 02:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
the guardian ad litem during the course
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
and and went through each complaint very
 
02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
and and went through each complaint very
carefully

02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
um and dealt with it by our usual
 
02:03:42.719 --> 02:03:44.030 align:start position:0%
um and dealt with it by our usual
protocol

02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
since this judge has been removed
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
there's been nothing else that's come in
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
regard to that case
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
um we do train the Guardians of light
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
them very carefully we don't get to
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
train the judges unfortunately sometimes
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
we wish we could do a judge training
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
because they're things that they could
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
do better to help the guardian ad light
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
them up optimally ultimately help the
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
families better
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
in regard to payment on the guardian ad
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
Leiden board we used to get a tremendous
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
number of complaints regarding payment
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very painful situation
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
it can be expensive even if the gal is
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
being paid sixty dollars an hour
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
frequently they're paid more it depends
 
02:04:32.290 --> 02:04:32.300 align:start position:0%
on the case
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature in your wisdom put the
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
payment before the judge and this has
 
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
been a tremendous move because the judge
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
is the one that orders specifically what
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
the gal should be doing what he or she
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
should look at
 
02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh what payment they're going to receive
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
and who's going to pay
 
02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
after all of this has happened there's
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
nothing the board can do
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
when the case is over we won't look at a
 
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
case until the case is closed
 
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
the judge is the person who needs to be
 
02:05:10.609 --> 02:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
hearing about the gal's doing too much
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
they're not going to see my person
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the the cases before that judge
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
right then and there and they're okaying
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
02:05:23.089 --> 02:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
we do require that the gals produce
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
itemized bills so that both parties can
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
see exactly how much time they spent
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
visiting different people so when the
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislature put the the bill paying in
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
front of the judge and that he or she
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
has to sign off that was tremendously
 
02:05:40.370 --> 02:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
helpful and I think it was insightful
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the judge to be able to be informed
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
on what was happening outside the court
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
those were my two points for my two
 
02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:48.410 align:start position:0%
those were my two points for my two
minutes

02:05:48.410 --> 02:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you said you
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any questions
 
02:05:53.570 --> 02:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for joking
 
02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:55.260 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
now just hand them here so that we can
 
02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:09.950 align:start position:0%
now just hand them here so that we can
wilcoaster

02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:15.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and special
 
02:06:20.089 --> 02:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
committee members thanks for allowing me
 
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
try to keep this quick and what I passed
 
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
out was just some of the highlights of
 
02:06:27.790 --> 02:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
what we've already been discussing and
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
to make good use of our time this is
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a summary of what we our
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
current uh if I could interrupt
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
um can you uh limit what you're going to
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
talk with us about today to information
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
that has not been given to us about
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
um a very
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
important case that has been discussed
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
and discussed and discussed very much I
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
want to provide that new information and
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
what uh representative Bickford and also
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
um Rebecca had spoken about is the same
 
02:07:04.970 --> 02:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
thing I would say my name is Michael
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
dinen I'm a parent of two daughters
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
um here to talk about kind of where we
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
were but really want to talk about
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
what's been done so far as you may be
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
aware of the child and family law last
 
02:07:20.890 --> 02:07:20.900 align:start position:0%
year we had one bill coming out HP 1647
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
also the Senate bill was Senate Bill 431
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
they kind of met in the middle they were
 
02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
both kind of dissected by both sides
 
02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
neither of them were able to pass each
 
02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:31.970 align:start position:0%
neither of them were able to pass each
other's

02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
other's
 
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:33.050 align:start position:0%
other's
um

02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
muster if you will so it was left with
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I think they were left into to study
 
02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.209 align:start position:0%
um I think they were left into to study
into

02:07:41.209 --> 02:07:41.219 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
um study but one of the things that was
 
02:07:44.209 --> 02:07:44.219 align:start position:0%
clear is that everyone was waiting for
 
02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
the last four-year report that four
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
report came out we've all heard it the
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
PTA parenting time adjustment was highly
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
recommended uh we're one of only nine
 
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
states that doesn't have we're one of
 
02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
nine states that doesn't have it we're
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
still third highest in child support
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
paid the purpose of me being here today
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
is to talk about our current efforts and
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
what's being done
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
um representative Bickford
 
02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:06.659 align:start position:0%
um representative Jim majory who could
 
02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
not be here today because he's working
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
another bill we're working together with
 
02:08:12.050 --> 02:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
some of the uh folks you've heard speak
 
02:08:14.450 --> 02:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
already Greg Lombardo who's here today
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
who spoke before he's someone that's new
 
02:08:18.169 --> 02:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
to this a lot of parents are coming
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
together and we're able to do this and
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're getting kind of sponsorship
 
02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
because since 2018 anyone goes in for
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
their three-year review will be as I was
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
as I was told my decision came out in
 
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
2019 is that because of Silva no
 
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
deviations are being given all the
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
courts are strictly abiding by this the
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bar Associates is
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
aware of this so everyone and they go in
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
for their Theory view comes out kind of
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
in shock and says this can't be possible
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
well I'm here to say you know what are
 
02:08:47.689 --> 02:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
we going to do about that someone should
 
02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
do something we are trying to do
 
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
something so we're pleased to have this
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
this effort we have the nhla Mary
 
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
Krueger is joining our discussion we're
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually having a discussion this
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have some potential
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
legislative language written up already
 
02:09:04.609 --> 02:09:04.619 align:start position:0%
that is called net the difference I
 
02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
think that's what everyone agrees to it
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh is kind of the most common means of
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
coming up with a PTA parenting time
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment we are looking for the bcss
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
to I know they are not part of scripting
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
laws but to you know evaluate this we
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
want everyone working together in the
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
start rather than kind of fighting at
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the end both SB 431 and also HP 1647
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
been a terrible fate
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
um we're here now and we are creating
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
new new legislation some of those
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
efforts I put in here identify them what
 
02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
also is in the second part of that is
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
the Anderson V Anderson which very
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
clearly states the judge Supreme Court
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
said it is not our job to create
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
legislation or to create laws that is
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
for the legislature and that's why we're
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
here today and that's why we're all
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
speaking I want to be clear this is not
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
the previous attempts was met with a
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of a resistance from
 
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
different groups it often is associated
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
this is a dad's problem obviously
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
speaking today Rebecca and there's many
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
other mothers that are part of this that
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
are in the same situation they're left
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
with no funds to raise their own
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
children and what that funds means I
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
just want to be very clear about this
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
not to be redundant but when you don't
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
have funds available to pay for camps to
 
02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
pay for extracurricular activities
 
02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
clothing and sometimes these families
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
are in an Indigent state in the lower
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
earners left in a very interesting State
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
you don't have that means you actually
 
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
don't have the means of parenting all
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
the parenting because of Sylvie Silva
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
you can mention Anderson as well because
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
we don't have a PTA and very clearly
 
02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
those two statutes 458 458 C one five
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
that equal approximately equal parenting
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
time or the oligar proving that there is
 
02:10:48.490 --> 02:10:48.500 align:start position:0%
a reduction in fixed cost which is a
 
02:10:51.530 --> 02:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
oxymoron you can't reduce fixed costs
 
02:10:54.169 --> 02:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
they're fixed because that of those two
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
statutes there is no means of the higher
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
earning parent
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
to actually parent their own children
 
02:11:02.649 --> 02:11:02.659 align:start position:0%
whether they even have them 70 percent
 
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
75 of the time so it's a very dire
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
situation more and more people are
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
coming to realize this everyone's in
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
shock when you explained what's what's
 
02:11:13.250 --> 02:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
happening and how everyone's left with
 
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
no funds so I look forward to being if
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a conduit for this
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
information we've got a good group going
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that there's a means of
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
getting Senator Carson aware of this I
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
know some of the the are our working
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
group as it's being called
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
um working with Mary Krueger but also
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
even Governor sununu I think is becoming
 
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
aware of this as well so very important
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
matter and I welcome any questions
 
02:11:40.609 --> 02:11:40.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:11:40.619 --> 02:11:42.109 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth thank you and
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
um one I I think your testimony I want
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
to give you a chance to practice you
 
02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
said there are no deviations currently
 
02:11:56.089 --> 02:11:56.099 align:start position:0%
given in child support guidelines there
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
there are high amount of deviations and
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
that would currently there are a high
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
amount of deviations so I think the last
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
study this for your study that came out
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
there were approximately about 80
 
02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:07.010 align:start position:0%
there were approximately about 80
percent

02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
um some of the cases noted was 80
 
02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:11.099 align:start position:0%
percent of deviations that means that's
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
a deviation that was you know previous
 
02:12:16.250 --> 02:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
to even 2018 but since Silva V Silva
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
there are less deviations there have
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
been less deviations
 
02:12:22.129 --> 02:12:22.139 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about on that
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
specific criteria of equal incomes or
 
02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
shared parenting I mean that is correct
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay so I just want to clarify that
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I guess um my question is I'm looking
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
here at um you know for the the statute
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um regarding child support and the
 
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
deviations there are 13 or 15
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
considerations that the court has
 
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and one of them is the issue that
 
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
you're talking about it says the court
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
can consider if it's a If the child
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
support order is complicous story you
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
know if it takes too much money so I
 
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
mean and there are others here I mean
 
02:12:58.729 --> 02:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
they're so was that issue brought up and
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
the court then and its judgment decided
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the order wasn't confiscatory in in
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
my case that it was not um Silva was
 
02:13:09.169 --> 02:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
noted throughout my cases that there was
 
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
not in it's mentioned in mind
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
specifically and many others have spoken
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
and it's part of the study that just
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
came out is that even by itself is not
 
02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
grounds for an adjustment or for
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
deviation so those the confiscatory
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
um whether you could measure that those
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
funds after mine was not part of that I
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
know many of the others are not they do
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
not take those other 13 into
 
02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:34.930 align:start position:0%
not take those other 13 into
consideration

02:13:34.930 --> 02:13:34.940 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to answer but well actually
 
02:13:37.739 --> 02:13:38.930 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to answer but well actually
yes

02:13:38.930 --> 02:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
so would you please provide us that
 
02:13:42.770 --> 02:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
where the court is stating that it will
 
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
not take into consideration regarding uh
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know shared because it's shared
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
parenting can't be on its own so it is
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I would be surprised if
 
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
there is an order where the court says
 
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
it will not consider this numeral too
 
02:13:57.169 --> 02:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
where it talks about if it is
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
confiscatory for the obligor so if you
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
could provide that to the committee that
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful I'd be glad you and it
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
just to add to that and I think to put
 
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
the question in context so I'm
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
understanding when they talk about the
 
02:14:10.850 --> 02:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
other statutes the ability to show that
 
02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
other statutes the ability to show that
the

02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:13.729 --> 02:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
um the children are living in equal or
 
02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
approximately equal conditions in both
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
homes that is something that is not it
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
had not been taken into consideration
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
either so what often happens and just to
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
put some light on this the higher
 
02:14:26.450 --> 02:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
earning parent because they're paying
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
the child support which ends up being
 
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
tax-free for the new for the home
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
receiving it the lower earner that's
 
02:14:36.169 --> 02:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
tax-free income so that those funds were
 
02:14:37.729 --> 02:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
intended to be shared across both
 
02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
households now because of silvery silver
 
02:14:42.530 --> 02:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think you've answered the question and
 
02:14:44.689 --> 02:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
I think what you're providing is
 
02:14:44.699 --> 02:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
I think what you're providing is
subjective

02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
um testimony well it is it's subjective
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
testimony because that's what's
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
happening with the courts and why judges
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
can't have a clear and concise uh
 
02:14:57.770 --> 02:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
methodology or calculations they're left
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's the wild west right now I'll be
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing your order thank
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you you
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
referenced that you had potential
 
02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
legislation written up that was called
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
net the difference but I just didn't see
 
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
that as part of this uh where could we
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
get that
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I have uh Jim majory and uh
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford uh would could
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that as well it
 
02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:31.310 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that as well it
um

02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:33.169 --> 02:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
it's an initial is that one of those
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
things where it basically states that if
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
let's say that the mom was well let's
 
02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
say that the dad was ordered to pay
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars and the mom was
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
ordered in the in the obligation
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
worksheet that the mom that the cost for
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
the dad was determined to be 3 000 the
 
02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
cost for the mom was determined to be 1
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
000 if then the dad would be paying the
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
mom one thousand so that both would have
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars is that what that
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
is the higher pays the lower yes exactly
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
and that's that's one of the
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
calculations that's there's about five
 
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
different that are used by different
 
02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
states throughout the country there's
 
02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:07.619 align:start position:0%
that's one of the five there's not the
 
02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
difference there's a
 
02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
um uh you know higher page the lower
 
02:16:13.129 --> 02:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
lower Pace the higher and that's the
 
02:16:13.139 --> 02:16:14.270 align:start position:0%
lower Pace the higher and that's the
Delta

02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
Delta
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
um but what I think is there's floating
 
02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
scales whether you know someone has the
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
child 30 and 70 of the time I think
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
those things get
 
02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:23.890 align:start position:0%
those things get
get

02:16:23.890 --> 02:16:23.900 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:16:27.649 --> 02:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
complex and confusing for a lot of the
 
02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
people reading them the net the
 
02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
difference is this version of it but
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
this is where we're trying to get input
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
from all of the the parties not just
 
02:16:37.610 --> 02:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
trying to have something that that the
 
02:16:39.469 --> 02:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
group thinks is effective or Jim majorie
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
or representative Bickford the previous
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
attempts 431 and 1647 were both very
 
02:16:46.610 --> 02:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
close in their calculations that they
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
were trying to have accepted but neither
 
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
of them were able to kind of suffer that
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
cross analysis when they were kind of
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
dissected so we're trying to come up
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
with that language I think that's where
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to be end up focusing
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
to see if they're accepting of that is
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
those calculations what do they look
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
like and this is why there's five
 
02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
different versions I'd say and all that
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
the study that that came out most
 
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
recently has those versions we're trying
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
to pick one that most everyone's
 
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
amenable to and I would ask as well if
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
there's a means of uh getting this and
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not representative obviously and I'm
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
just a father a parent but if there's a
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
means of getting attention to this and
 
02:17:29.929 --> 02:17:29.939 align:start position:0%
so it can be worked on and get that in
 
02:17:31.969 --> 02:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
the right hands I know that the bcss is
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
aware of it and I don't know how that
 
02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
process works but thankfully

piece of legislation that of course has
 
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be done by members of the legislature
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%

information from the public and from
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%

the Circuit Court Family Division Conway
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%

being allowed by the court I would
 
02:19:12.889 --> 02:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
answer questions on that but it's not
 
02:19:15.290 --> 02:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
part of today's testimony
 
02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
our family case has been ongoing for
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
three years and has turned into a very
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
complex case that shouldn't have been
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be about the children
 
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
on May 4th uh on 4 11 2017 my co-parent

with the functioning of the family court
 
02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:31.500 align:start position:0%

for our hearing on a motion for a gal
 
02:25:35.809 --> 02:25:35.819 align:start position:0%

for a child who desperately needs
support

02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh without question somebody confident
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
to look out for the best interests of
 
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
the Sun
 
02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:49.070 align:start position:0%
the Sun
uh

02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
so you have this and you can continue
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
reading it I was refused I was refused
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
of everything from from the judge and
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.490 --> 02:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
my co-parents submitted a petition for a
 
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
civil DV order stating that I had her
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%

02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
one arrested
 
02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
and it was granted by judge Green Hall
 
02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
case numbers in front of you uh
 
02:26:19.849 --> 02:26:19.859 align:start position:0%

02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to interrupt you again you
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
know we are not an appellate Corp yep we
 
02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
are not going to make any uh change or
 
02:26:33.410 --> 02:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
suggest any change in your case
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%

02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
what changes we should consider
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
um recommending both to the court for
 
02:26:50.809 --> 02:26:50.819 align:start position:0%
changes that they could make in their
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
procedure and to the legislature in
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that we could make
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
sure so that is that is what we need can
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
you give me a you know in the next two
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
minutes can you give me
 
02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:06.290 align:start position:0%
minutes can you give me

um
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
any suggestions specific suggestions for
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
changes that should be made either in
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
how the court functions or how the
 
02:27:20.929 --> 02:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
legislature should change the rsas sure
 
02:27:23.389 --> 02:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
along with my testimony as well as many
 
02:27:25.849 --> 02:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
testimonies that you've heard before and
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
I agree with uh judge Gordon uh the
 
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
inexperience and under qualified judges
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh that are are doing Family Court
 
02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
should not be doing Family Court uh uh
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
and he's in judge Green Hall is one of
 
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
them okay on in on 2016 he had his
 
02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.809 align:start position:0%
them okay on in on 2016 he had his
nomination

02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
nomination
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
during a public hearing the transcript
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
is available for that too where he
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
shared his own experience with the
 
02:27:51.889 --> 02:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
family court as well as answered
 
02:27:53.929 --> 02:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
questions from the executive Council and
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
specifically questions from governor
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
sununu who was on the council at the
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
time about his bedside manners and pro
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
se litigants
 
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
he didn't have experience and he
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
automatically became a family court
 
02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:06.889 align:start position:0%
automatically became a family court
judge

02:28:06.889 --> 02:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:28:09.770 --> 02:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so I I agree that
 
02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
one of your recommendations is that uh
 
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
the court should not assign to the
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
family court individuals who do not have
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
experience with the family Corps I
 
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
exactly the way it used to be you want
 
02:28:26.809 --> 02:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
to be a family court judge you got to
 
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
have family court acknowledge uh and
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
just like there's you know the training
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
for GAO the you know we just heard that
 
02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
there's no training for a judge I think
 
02:28:37.969 --> 02:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
there should be a family court judge if
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to make decisions based on
 
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
the best interest of a child my child is
 
02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
being abused and neglected and it's
 
02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
being ignored because of the conflict of
 
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
interest between the attorney and the
 
02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
judge thank you very much it's that
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful do you have any just
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
in in closing out do you have any other
 
02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you would like to make
 
02:28:57.180 --> 02:28:58.849 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you would like to make
um

02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:58.859 --> 02:29:01.210 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

02:29:01.210 --> 02:29:01.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be equal we're supposed to
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
start this case equal I'm supposed to
 
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
have equal rights unless there's a
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
reason not to they're making they're
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
creating this is called astronomy and
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're creating a reason for there not
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
to be equality but it started out of the
 
02:29:16.610 --> 02:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
temporary hearing when I was already
 
02:29:19.130 --> 02:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
being deprived of my rights
 
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
for no reason
 
02:29:24.410 --> 02:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and very much these
 
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.060 align:start position:0%

02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
with your testimony and with all the
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
other information that we have I uh
 
02:30:06.050 --> 02:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I just want to point
 
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
out that under house rules we will not
 
02:30:13.010 --> 02:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
be able to conduct
 
02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:14.110 align:start position:0%
be able to conduct
um

02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:14.120 align:start position:0%

02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
the summer to review information that's
 
02:30:32.770 --> 02:30:32.780 align:start position:0%
been submitted to us and to consider
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
possible recommendations that we would
 
02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
make and we would be coming back
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%

here not just for myself but for the
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
general public now we heard about HR 14
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
a bill that was just not passed and that
 
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
and it was never brought out the two
 
02:31:08.270 --> 02:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
things the two reasons what it wasn't
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
passed it was just told that there was
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
