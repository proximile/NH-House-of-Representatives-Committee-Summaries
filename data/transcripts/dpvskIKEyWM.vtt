all of you have if you've been um kind
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
of paying attention to what's going on
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
in the Senate just to give you kind of a
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
brief update and representative Sullivan
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
you feel free to to add a few things
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
um I received an email I guess from uh
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative of wolf yesterday that
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
our bill regarding um firefighters on
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
the way to a call um the way we amended
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
that um the Senate has app approved it
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
out of committee 5 to zero and it looks
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be on the consent
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
agenda so it's okay the bill
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
regarding um UTI being able to utilize U
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana as a
 
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
acceptable um I don't want to say
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
condition what is acceptable uh form of
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
treatment um there has been a
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of push back uh by
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh in the Senate I did
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the lobbyists for law
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement yesterday and they don't
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
know what the Senate is going to do with
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
it um so um that that's up in the air uh
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
representative kahill and I yesterday
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
spoke on um H Bill 1178 regarding um
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh receipt of uh vacation time and and
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
such and
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh they were in the middle now they have
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of things to look at uh
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative K did a good job
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
presenting his case I I I uh presented
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
my two cents and and we gave them an
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh whether they're going
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
to whether they do these things or have
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee I'm waiting to talk to
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
the chairman to see where he wants to go
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
um I think we came to consensus that two
 
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the three things things that that
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
that representative kill and I agree on
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
they may accept so we we'll wait and see
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
how that goes so I don't know I have not
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
heard of any games being played with any
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
of our bills so I don't know um but um
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
we we will wait and see uh unfortunately
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh very
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
surprisingly um did not uh pass the
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment Securities increase in
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
benefits bill
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
and I think the the I was told this
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
isn't private information I was told by
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
the uh the Department of Employment
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
Securities that they didn't think that
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
the the senator presented really tried
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
very hard to to try to get it through it
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
really wasn't any discussion uh I don't
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
know what went on over there I'm still
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
trying to find out but I'm probably
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
going to have one of these bills be a uh
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
study committee excuse me not a sub
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
study committee a subcommittee so we can
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
work on uh representative McKenzie's
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
Bill and how we we put it on there's
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
certain rules we're trying to get
 
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:07.949 align:start position:0%
certain rules we're trying to get
answers

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:07.959 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
to things that I've never had happen
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
before amending a non a bill with a no
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
Financial um note with one that might
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
have a financial note although we don't
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
think this one really deserves a
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
financial note so we're waiting to see
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
what the clerk says about this but I am
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to have a um a um subcommittee on
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.310 align:start position:0%
one of these
probably

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
330 um because it deals with the same
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
same uh
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
RSA so those are only things that I have
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
do anyone have any questions for me
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
here to testify on the bill so happy to
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
take any questions at this
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
point thank you for your testimony are
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
I completely support the bill let me
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
just say that up front I just want to
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that um and this is a issue
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
that been circulating this committee and
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
I think we have a bill working on it
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
deals with remote workers to make sure
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
that remote workers are given this uh
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
this information as well uh there were
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
14% of the jobs posted in New Hampshire
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
recently were remote work and there was
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
some concern I have about whether or not
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
the information that the Department
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
already has the responsibility to to
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
transmit this information to workers is
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh is going through so I just want to
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
make sure we get that no I think that's
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
a really great question it's a really
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
interesting proposal I'm happy to take
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
it back to the senator and see if he
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
would have any concerns about
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
St um in looking over the um uh the
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
materials um from the from the Senate um
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
I saw that someone from the Department
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
of Labor said it would also be feasible
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
to do this via email did I get that
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
correct I cannot speak to that I was not
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
in the hearing but I am guessing the
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
department is the department is not here
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
but we will make sure that we um reach
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
out to the department so they they are
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
here the other side of me so I'm sure
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
they would be able to offer that
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%

over the years before he passed in
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
2019 he was old school no idea who to
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
talk to what numbers to call and what he
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
was entitled to this bill would
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
certainly help his generation and the
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
generation to follow just all you have
 
00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:10.839 align:start position:0%
to do is scan the QR code on the the
 
00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:11.829 align:start position:0%
to do is scan the QR code on the the
sheet

00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
provided everything you need will be
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
right there in front of you my dad being
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
the older generation had no idea what
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
his benefits were or what he was
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
entitled to when he passed my mom had no
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
idea what she was entitled to and to me
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
that isn't fair a man who serves 17
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
years in the military deserves to know
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
what his benefit benefits are having
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
this posting makes it easier for our
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
service members past present and future
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
let's be honest we are in an era where
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
conflict is
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
inevitable we are sending our brothers
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
and sisters Sons daughters to fight for
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
this country let's make it easy for them
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
to transition back into civilian life
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
make it easier for them to get the
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
benefits they are entitled to and what
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
they fought for coming home from
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
deployment or War isn't easy transition
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
for most seeing things that the average
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
person doesn't see or doing things the
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
average person and doesn't do makes it a
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
hard transition back into the civilian
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
lifestyle when our troops raise their
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
right hand and take that oath of
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
enlistment right there they lose their
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
freedom whether it be 4 years 6 years or
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
30 more they sacrifice their entire life
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
family holidays birthdays graduations
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
weddings births the list goes on they
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
sacrifice everything they protect
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
everything to protect this country the
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
least we can do is put a simple posting
 
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799 align:start position:0%
up so they can easily access the help
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire today I'm representing the
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
20 member organization of the state
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee and to be
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
honest yours is a committee that I don't
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
see very often so I'd like to take just
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
a second and give an idea what we do and
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
then I'm I'm going to tell you that we
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
fully support this bill we're made up of
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
20 veteran organizations names that
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
would be familiar to you things like the
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
the American Legion the Veterans of
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
Foreign Wars I personally represent the
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
air and space forces Association
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
we have a legislative committee that
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
looks at bills and then the ones that
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
have veteran impact I come up and
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
testify in the public hearing what we
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
think of these bills we wholeheartedly
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
support this legislation um because with
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
the Advent of the PCT act there are now
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
a lot more veterans walking around there
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
that are entitled to services that maybe
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
they don't know that they're entitled to
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
now so this is a great thing for that we
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
also like the fact that that because
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're taxpayers too uh this bill doesn't
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it's going to cost a
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
lot of money to move through and and the
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
last part of this thing is if you look
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
at the list of people that support this
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
bill it has strong bipartisan support
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
across the board and we always are are
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%

00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
my name is Paul morenzi I'm a proud
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
member of United Steel Workers and a
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
veteran of the US Army Army Reserve I
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
serve for a total of 12 Years while
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
serving in the military your pay is not
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
great but you earn many worthwhile
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
benefits these benefits are paid for by
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
the us taxpayers the money is allotted
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
to the different programs to serve the
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
veteran Community if the program is not
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
used its funding is reduced the cut the
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
reason this happens is to some to some
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
programs is because either the veterans
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
don't know about the program or can't
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how or where to get the
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
information to access it at the time
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
when military members are rsing from
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
their service whether it's from a state
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
side foreign or combat deployment you
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
have mountains of paperwork and files to
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
go over pay files insurance health forms
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
gear turnning paperwork and also the
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
information about different benefits you
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
have earned this information can be
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming for some and others are
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
only half listening because they're
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
young in the best shape of their lives
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
and they feel Invincible they're not
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about health and other benefits
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
they're more concerned with getting home
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
to their significant others families
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
friends and going out to have a beer at
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
the local pub with their buddies But as
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
time goes on they get married have
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
children grow older and they may develop
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
health issues employment issues or need
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
legal help the this is when they need
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
some of those benefits they earned they
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
don't always remember how or where to
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
find access to them for veterans who may
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
be struggling with physical and mental
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
health issues knowing where to get this
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
help is extremely important and in some
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
cases may be a life or death situation
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
also there's many scams out there that
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
prey on Veterans so it's important that
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
they're able to get legitimate
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
information that is why SB 588 is so
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
important these postings hanging in the
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
workplace will list and steer veterans
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
and their families to legitimate
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
websites and contacts to get the
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
information to help by having it posted
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
in the workplace it will be there to
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
help the people who need it this is why
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to support what I
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
consider a no-brainer of a bill it is a
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill that will have minimal cost and
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to help so many
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
right now this veterans information
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
poster is being discussed in a bunch of
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
States I personally hope it becomes a
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
national law because it's that important
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
t very well spoken I'm wondering since
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony is written if we could
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
have a copy for sure
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:37.710 align:start position:0%

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak in support of SB
 
00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.230 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak in support of SB
588

00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
588
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
relative to employer notice of veterans
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
benefits and
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
services my name is Dave doas solar and
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
I am member of the US W and I reside in
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
Derry New
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if SB 588 were to become law
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would then
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
create a posting of veterans Benefit
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
services and crisis hotline
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
numbers this posting would then be added
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to the mandatory post that are attached
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
to all employer bulletin boards the
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
minimum wage boards I call them we feel
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
that this is a great way for our vets in
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
the workplace to access all the
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
important benefits and services that are
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
there for them and that they are
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
entitled to the United Ste workers
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
started this campaign policy last year
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
and the goal is to have this veterans
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
posted on employer Bolen boards in all
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
50 states and
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
territories the state of New York was
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
the first to pass this veterans bill and
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that there are seven other
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
states that have passed some sort of
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
version of the bill in one form or
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
another we certainly love the state of
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be added to that list I
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
passed out an example of the post that
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New York came up with so
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
you would have an idea of what sb8 588
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
is trying to accomplish we feel that
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
this is a simple but important bill and
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
urg US committee to vote ought to pass
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
and send it to the house floor thank you
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%

stab and representative McKenzie's
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
question first about um Can these people
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
provide electronically the answer is yes
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
um employers these days can provide
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
these electronically um there's no
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
specific format for that but so long as
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
the employees all have ready access to
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
this poster as well as the other U
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory posters that are required um
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
beyond that though the the department
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
has carefully reviewed this bill we have
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
no concerns about carrying out the
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill but I'm happy to
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.310 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
may

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
have any questions for represent bani
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um how is this
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
going to be enforced in a uh employer by
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
employer basis if the employer does not
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
have any employees is this still going
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be mandatory is there will there be a
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
fine if this is not hung up with the
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory postings is it going to be
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
added to the
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory poster that we have um down
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
the road will it be how are we going to
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is available to
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
everyone so if it's not hanging up and
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
the employer doesn't know about if the
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
employeer doesn't have employees is he
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
still going to
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
be subject to further scrutiny yeah
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
excellent question so the the way this
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh the other poster law is or those laws
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
are enforced now is if our inspectors go
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
out and notice that they're not posted
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
or if we receive a complaint that the
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
posters aren't there and there are six
 
00:27:26.909 --> 00:27:26.919 align:start position:0%
other posters that are required um we
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
usually engag in in An Education First
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
strategy um to make sure that they have
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
the poster and that they can provide it
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
um under our enforcement law for this
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
provision which would be
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
27311 um a violation of this would be a
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
warning first um any subsequent
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
violations could be punishable by a
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
$2,500 or up to a $2,500 civil penalty
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
um but generally speaking these issues
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
don't for the posters don't come up that
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
often it's not a prevalent um complaint
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
that we receive nor is it a a common
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
actions so if this wasn't posted uh
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
would there be a reason to have a to go
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
into an employer and look for other
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
issues as well would this be a way
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
into it could be I mean like any
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
complaint we receive about employers it
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
could be um but we would likely if if
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
this were the sole thing we received a
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
call on I I imagine we would likely
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
engage first on a telephonic call and
 
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
and an education to make sure that they
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
knew about it and they knew where to
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
find it and they knew that it had to be
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
posted thank you thank you thank you Mr
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
chair representative kale thank you
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question isn't it isn't it
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
true that uh fines are often drastically
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
reduced by the department uh if if it
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
were to be a and I and I do I do doubt
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
that an inspector would be called in
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
because that poster is missing or would
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
not just bring a poster along and say
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
here would you please hang this up but
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
in the event that there was a fine as
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
there are for other violations isn't
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
that the standard practice of the
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
department to negotiate that down in
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
exchange for
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
compliance that is a very common
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
practice and again it there wouldn't be
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
there legally speaking there couldn't be
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
a fine the first time around uh the way
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
the laws are in for this particular
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
violation it would have to be a warning
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
even if action were taken the fines
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
would only come into play if there were
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent or recurring violations but
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
the fine would be up to $2500 it doesn't
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
have to be there's no minimum of $2500
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
and those findes usually aren't aren't
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
you cworth thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
something you said sparked a question
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
about the Department of Labor and the
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
estimate of the the minimal cost of this
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill says shall
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
create and distribute and I'm wondering
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean a physical distribution
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
or what what does that mean to the
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
department those yeah excellent question
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
um we provide copies of the posters
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
electronically um they're not they're
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
all 8 and 1 half by 11 black and white
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
printed sheets they're not massive large
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
color glossy things they're not they're
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
not pretty that way they're just they're
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
straightforward into the point so um we
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
always direct uh employers to our
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
website that has those on it for them to
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
print out um If an employer ever
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't print one out or needed a
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
physical copy I'm sure we would take
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
care of that for them and and provide
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
McKenzie have to keep reminding me turn
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
probably getting old let me uh let me
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
ask you the you made a statement that it
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
generally is not come up as an issue or
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
a problem do you ever audit any of this
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
would you ever take a look at and say
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay we we going to take 25 different
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
businesses and see what their policy is
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
relative to to transmitting this stuff
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
electronically because this is a new
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
wave this is a new situation we're
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
getting into with the remote workers and
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
so I was somewhat of a concerned that a
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
lot of legislation that is uh embraced
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
in that those notices uh it's important
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
and people don't know much about the
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
notices and they probably don't know a
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
whole heck of a lot about the
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
protections that are built into those
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
and how those came to be so so I'd be
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
interested to know if you ever audited
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff so I'm not aware of
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
that ever occurring like that again
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
usually the posters um any sort of
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement on those usually comes up if
 
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
the inspector is responding to another
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
complaint uh at a workplace and just
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
while there is you know asking you know
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
where your where are your mandatory
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
posters where they where they posted um
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm not aware of an audit happening
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
like that um I'm not sure the department
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
would engage in such an audit just for
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
just for the posters but I can I can
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly ask but I'm not
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
it see any other questions thank you
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
very much thank you I have no other uh
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
people signed up to present is there
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
anyone else who has not set a card who
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
to okay so I'm going to close the
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%

residential life programs at higher

education institutions for over a 100
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
years they have not been viewed as
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
traditional employees if they were
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
reclassified as employees their hours
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
would be tracked and their wages would
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
be taxable this fundamentally changed
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
the programs and the universities could
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
decide to move away from offering Free
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
Housing so let me tell you personally
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
this affects me I was um it's way too
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
long ago when was 84 so I'm like 40
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
years out of um being an Raa at Dominic
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
Hall and by when I was there I learned a
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
lot I learned to it was like a big
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
brother role in many ways um you were
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
there for advice uh you were there if
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
there was a problem um anyone who went
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
to St ansem knows Dominic was the Hockey
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hall so we had some problems up there
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
but you learned to deal with people you
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
learned leadership skills who learned
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
organizational skills and um helped me a
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
lot in my first few jobs I have three
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
children now who are either just
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
finishing College um I've won Billy's at
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
um finishing up at 10 he really got into
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
higher educational academic areas
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
because he was an RA At Con College led
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
him to his first job um now he's going
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
to start a doctoral program there thank
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
God they're free because I couldn't
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
afford them um and I have one at one
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
just got through holy cross again she a
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
couple years was an IRA it saved her
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
room boarded and they were non- taxable
 
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
it's been the traditional way in the
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
United States again to treat these
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
positions because they're not um when I
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
was back a million years ago when I was
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
at St anel I had other jobs on campus I
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
did clock in um I worked in I had a
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
great gig because I was a a student
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
athlete so I picked up the money and I
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
brought it the change that they made
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
that day and I brought it to the
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
academic building and it was 2 hours pay
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
best gig I've ever had in my life
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
carrying a sack of money but it was
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
something I clocked in I clocked in and
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
they gave me two hours for it I worked
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
in the library same thing I clocked in
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
they knew the hours and so it was a job
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
I had responsibilities being an RA is
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
much less precise most of the time no
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
one really wants to bother the ra um you
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
get called when you're needed some
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
especially we had a lot of young 17
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
year-olds at sameed my year and they had
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems getting used to a
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
college campus so I was dealing with
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
that a lot you'd have Friday nights you
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
might have an altercation or something
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
um you might have kids just any number
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
of things um personal problems other
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
things but they would come to you
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
sporadically most of the time I got to
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
study um I was getting paid while I was
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
there uh through my free room and board
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
and again non- tax it saved my family so
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
the third one's going to start at
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
Trinity next year she's going to be an
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
RA again very we could not afford all
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
these highered colleges with without
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
getting free room and board um so to tax
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
my family you would we figured it's
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 80 and 100,000 from me
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
to my children that has been saved in my
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
family again untaxed the system's not
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
broken I would say don't try to fix it
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
just keep the system we have where raas
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
are not treated as employees um other
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
reasons why that is important again I
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
never felt I was you know you're sort of
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
are you always on call maybe a little
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
bit around campus to students who there
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
were probably two or 300 people who
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
lived at Domin a call who might approach
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
you and you might give advice on things
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
from time to time but it wasn't like a
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
consistent nine-to-five job and most it
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't a job where you're punching in I
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
was very happy as was everyone I knew
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
and my children we very happy with the
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
systems of our Ras not being employees
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
um it didn't seem at the last Hearing in
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
the Senate we only were aware of one
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
incident at that time at Plymouth where
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
there was one student who might have
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to be an RA who might wanted to
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
have been treated as an employee other
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
than that we have a 100 Years of
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
everyone very happy with the system as
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
it is and so that's what this bill seeks
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify is that um an RA again is not
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
an employee thank
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much um are there
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so let me maybe this just a
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
okay so Ras come to the college campus
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
um and can you explain to the committee
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
what the process is for bringing on an
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
IRA sure uh the nature of of the work
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah uh where this is uh detailed are
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
there are there handbooks are there
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
other things that that uh they receive
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh do they um
 
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.150 align:start position:0%
uh do they um
they

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
interviewed uh and then who directs them
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
within the university
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
system um so I I'll just tell you what I
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
know and what what I lived and what my
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
children are doing as they are in other
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
states but they are active Ras so back
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
402 years ago or so um we did we had a
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
Ser you applied for the job or you
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
applied for the position on campus uh it
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
was going to be my junior senior year I
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
was watching my student loans increase
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
and um even though it was nothing
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
compared to what it is now for I think
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
it was $5,000 room board in tuition when
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
I went to St anom so the girls from
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
Darth can appreciate how cheap that was
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
I didn't at the time it was a lot of
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
money at the time um so I applied for
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
the job I think I had a first interview
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
um we happened to be a religious school
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
so there were a few priests there uh
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
staff from the campus there were
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
probably six or seven people who did my
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
first interview I think the second
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
interview was down to one or two and um
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
why did I want to do was I wanted the
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
free room and board um I didn't really
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
realize the things you're going to learn
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
while you're doing the job just like
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
when you sign up for the military or
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
something you learn lot more than you
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
thought you were um so you did you
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
learned how to interact with people you
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
had problems that you don't anticipate
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to come out you know
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
interaction of people living life in
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
front of you and you're sort of in
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
charge of keeping them somewhat in order
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
um and they can have problems from you
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
know over drinking I'm sure there were
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
many nights um especially the Freshman
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
found Heen repper and it was not a good
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
drink to start on um and so you learn to
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
deal with people and their problems
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
their relationship problems being far
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
away from home but again it's not
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
something you're doing all the time I
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
certainly was a varc athlete while I was
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
there um I had plenty of time I wasn't
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
on call that often I think I had one
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
weekend night the other nights you're
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
just mostly do your studying there as
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to the library and someone might
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
come by with a question or a problem or
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you chairman if I could follow
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
up so you are applied yep for the job
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
yep you were interviewed for the job yep
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
and my children are the same at um
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
Trinity Holy Cross and Connecticut
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
College and uh at pen um they've all
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
went through a similar process so you so
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
you did that sounds very similar to what
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
a job would normal job would be so at
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
some point you discuss what the
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
compensation would be I for that
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
particular position now you may not
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
consider sure I don't think I knew what
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
it was I we were all aware anyone who
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to be in Ra was a whereare you
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
were going to get at the time I don't
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
know that it's still bored it was also
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
bored at my time it was room and boor um
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
so was a substantial chunka chain you
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
aware that you're going to get some
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
compensation in that form no cash most
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
of them I don't believe give you any
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
cash but that was compensation sure but
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
it was for an inexact job you don't know
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
you I I think some my floor happened to
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
be probably more of a problem floor uh
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of fraternity guys up there
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
we had the whole hockey team up there so
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
I probably had more disciplinary things
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
than others other floors um there were
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
other dorms much more quiet it's where I
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to be though there were the
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
people I knew so I chose that role but
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
it was I was I knew I would still be
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
able to do I could go travel do a sport
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
I could go study I had a full course
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
load it wasn't like a full-time job or
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
even an hourly job it was just it would
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
arise as it needed to be there would be
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
days I'm sure I did nothing um I also
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
got a shower so I was very happy I had
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
your own little bathroom so uh there
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
were that was another perk but it wasn't
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
like I was going to my other jobs on
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
campus that I had I had to actually
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
perform a task that I was assigned to do
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
someone was strictly on top of me this
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
was more of a looser thing that as long
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
as there were no big Pro and we in our
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
place we had uh there was AE of the dorm
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
it happened to be a priest at the time
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
he lived in the building so if there was
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
a major problem
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
um you'd you know interact with them and
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
they would more get involved with more
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
serious things but you were sort of a
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
lower level person who was just sort of
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
needed I a couple of final questions if
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
I could and then I'll I know a lot of
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions probably in the committee but
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
follow up followups so we have this this
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
process that you get hired
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about what the compensation
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
would be whether it be woman board
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
orever the case may
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
be uh were you
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
supervised sure so did we have booklets
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
I think you asked earlier yeah there was
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
a I'm I can't exactly remember but yes
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
and my children at their schools there
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
are pamphlets on like you know what do
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
you do if in certain situations I
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
believe we got there a week early um
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
which were you supervised I guess my I
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
didn't mean was I supervised not so it
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
was a loose loose as long as things were
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
going fine and there were the dorm
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
didn't get burnt down um people were
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
pretty happy so when things weren't
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
going fine there was something on a
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
Friday night or Saturday night I'm sure
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
there were a time or two that um the
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
again he was a priest he was in charge
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
of the building I'm sure if it was St
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
Patrick's Day weekend we were more
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
around than we would be in another time
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
would you be F followup sure I yes um
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes I'm sure I if I didn't do
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
the job if I wasn't there kids were
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
saying geez Bill ganon's never here we
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
have problems uh we just telling them a
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
light bulb I think they'd usually go to
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
me if the light bulb was out something
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
they'd tell and I'd tell the janitor
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
they'd fix it um so yeah you did have
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
other but again it was a very loose
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
thing that you no one was watching me
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
daily if there were problems they yeah
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
would interact and say you're going to
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
hang your job you Friday nights you're
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
on duty night you should be there most
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
of the time was pretty loose I was
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
traveling all over the Northeast running
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
and playing back basketball so it wasn't
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
something that I felt I was on call 247
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
I just was around when I needed to be
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
around great thank you and by the way St
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
is a great campus campus walk every day
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
okay it's beautiful place thank you
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:42.829 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
bushard thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thanks for having
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
me um do our receive a W2
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
form I don't I don't think we did I I
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
can't remember how we
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh I was young I wasn't making much
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
money at the time I was going to school
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
full-time so I don't think I I can't I'm
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
not sure I don't believe we did but
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
maybe we
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
do okay well it was a long time ago for
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
me that was my big question okay um I'm
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
sure we can find that out for you but um
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
so so if they okay follow up so if they
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
would be issued a W2 W2 form would you
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
consider them an employee I don't I
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
think this is a unique relationship I
 
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
think when I worked in the cafeteria or
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
I did other jobs I wasn't an employee
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
relation I performed a specific task
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is a much more loose system it's
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
been around in our country since Zan
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
as's 1892 I don't know when they started
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
but I know in the 20s and 30s they had
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
Ras um the systems worked fine I don't I
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
thought I was it was a fair exchange for
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
me and um again it was a tax-free
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
exchange I thought that was great saved
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
me money
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
allowed me to have my kids go to better
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
schools than they probably would
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
svin thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
question um this um bill has five
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
sections to it um and each section deals
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
with a different piece of uh section of
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
the rsas and um I guess I'd like to look
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
first at section two um it indicates
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
that it deals with um RS
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
um addressing discrimination in the
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
workplace can you explain why it would
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to remove discrimination
 
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
protections um from someone in an RA
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
position I'm going to I have others who
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
are going to follow their attorneys or
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
people from the University system I have
 
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not as probably familiar with the
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill as I should be at this time to
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
answer that question so I I would I
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at it in about a month so
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize for that followup
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
follow I suspect your answer will be the
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
same but I also wanted to address um the
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh the section on uh wa a
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
minut workers compensation
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
um if with the concern that if a ra was
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
um injured while um performing their
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
duties as an RA um would you feel that
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
they uh should be either compensated or
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
at least have their uh
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh injury treated under the workers
 
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
uh injury treated under the workers
compensation

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
law uh section six I know I didn't
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
testify it to it it is in the amendment
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh section six related to
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation I was looking
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
at removed I was looking at section five
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay again I'll let other people after
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
me testify to that I know there are
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
people from the University system going
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
to testify thank you
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative Schulz thank you thank
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
you for can I say one thing
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative suin you asked me do I
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
feel if someone what was the
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
situation if they were injured while
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
performing their duties as an RA
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they um their injuries be
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
compensation I'd have to think about it
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
more thank you so thank you
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative sure my question um is
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
about I don't think this involves
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
College work study and if I'm curious to
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
know um if that was a consideration when
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
you wrote the Bill um since in a sense
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's sort of similar I mean it is
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
similar in the sense that you have to be
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
a student to do that
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
work but you get a paycheck instead of
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
room and
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
board so I see a difference there when
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
you get a paycheck I see a difference um
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
you may not the financial compensation
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
and the hourly work you said for what
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
what type position it's the federal
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
college work study
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
program um I would say that you're
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
probably doing more of a task on work
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
study as opposed
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
to you know I me not doing a specific
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
task not being on call
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
247 um I just I don't see it exactly the
 
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.870 align:start position:0%
247 um I just I don't see it exactly the
same

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
now so it wasn't considered when you it
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't considered so the University
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
system came to me and I think they know
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
I went to S someone might have known I
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
had been an RA and we discussed the bill
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
and in it's that's where I I have others
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
who are better at it than I but I I like
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
the idea I enjoyed getting were uh being
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
at S A being an RA U my son who's now
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
going into highered it's it's developed
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
him into an outgoing person um it's done
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of things for
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
him and I the system has worked for me
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
as it's been in place for 100 years so I
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't again see the need to change
 
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.109 align:start position:0%
don't again see the need to change
it

00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.990 align:start position:0%
it
representative

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you again
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
um you talk a lot about the um UNH and
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
um the State University system um it
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
would appear the way this is drafted
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
that it would affect all colleges and
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
universities in New Hampshire is that
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
accurate yes that's
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
correct all of them would it surprise
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
you to hear that the um raas at
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth do receive a stipend which is
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
taxed um no I think they're going to
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
testify to that I just realized that
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
this morning um so it wouldn't surprise
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
me now thank
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
you representive
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
Stu good morning thank you for taking my
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
question um you have spoken a lot about
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
how this system has worked so well for
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
such a long period of time um why do you
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
feel that it's necessary to make these
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
changes right now I believe the
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
university came to me because nationally
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's not really an organic movement um
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know that people are trying they
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
want them nationally there's a movement
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
to try to include oura as workers um for
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
whatever reason be it unionizing or
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it is but it's a national
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
movement so the university system here I
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
think was trying to preempt that thank
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for the
 
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.030 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for the
senator

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
presentation before I call up the next
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
person uh a co-sponsor of the bill
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters cannot be here and ask
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
that a statement be read in and so
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan offered to do
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
Waters so this is addressed to the house
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
committee on labor industrial and
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative servfaces that's us um
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
from Senator uh David Waters um and it
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
goes as follows I'm writing to explain
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
my opposition to the bill despite my
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
signing on as a co-sponsor having been
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
contacted by the University of New
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about the bill when it was in
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
its Drafting and having in my 39 years
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
worked with many students who were
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
residential assistants it seemed at
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
first that employment status could be a
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
problematic um could be problematic due
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
to difficulties in defining work duties
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
and tracking hours however on a fuller
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
Fuller investigation it became apparent
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
that such employment status was not
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the duties of of the
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
work for students since other
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
educational institutions supported and
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
managed such employment status moreover
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
the changes proposed in this law would
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
in fact be intrusive to educational
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
institutions and of greatest importance
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
prevent students from exercising their
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
their rights and protections afforded
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
employees it is best to admit a mistake
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
and that is what I made in giving
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
initial support to this bill I would
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
encourage my colleagues in the house to
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
give careful consideration to the
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
limitations this bill would impose and
 
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.270 align:start position:0%
limitations this bill would impose and
vote

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%

actually under the Clinton
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
Administration and current state statute
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
federal guideline Federal us do
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines provide exemptions from the
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
definition of employee for Resident
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
assistance I'll call them raas some
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
schools call them community advis ERS
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
Etc so that was the Genesis for the bill
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
the um we the university system worked
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire college and
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
university Council we worked with the
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Labor um the
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
community college system supports the
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
bill also and that's how the L the bill
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
um got its legs and we reached out to
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Ganon for sponsorship with the
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire college and university
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
Council uh we seek status quo
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
effectively we've been operating under
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
these federal guidelines for decades and
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
the relationship between our resident
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
assistants and the campuses is such that
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh we do believe that this is an
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity for a number of
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
students our students are provided free
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
room and board they do not receive a W2
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
they are not taxed on um that benefit if
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
you will um frankly I think there are a
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
number of student students where they
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
not Ras they may not be able to afford
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
to enjoy a residential college
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
experience and um so I'm going to try to
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that I've
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
heard from Members this
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
morning um this does not impact other
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
work study students that would be
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
considered employees and do receive a W2
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
because it's specific with those fed
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines relative to educational
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for for those students
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
that are provided that that are they do
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
apply there it's on it's online they do
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
and I I'll speak for the University
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
system institutions they are supervised
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
by a professional paid staff member um
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
as resident
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
assistants um I will say that there are
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
other sections of the bill I'll be
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
honest we we were f focused on the time
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
and wage part of the statute because if
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have to especially on the dining
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
piece if we have to re-examine how if
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of a student's
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
compensation um we may not in the
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
future credit the students
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
bill before the semester if we had to
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
pay that over the semester as the work
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
is done relative to the time and wage
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
statute which again would I think um
 
00:58:34.349 --> 00:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
impact students financial aid and their
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
ability to pay their bill so on the
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
workers comp piece we don't take
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
exception to removing the workers comp
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
piece from the bill honestly on the
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
Discrimination piece we don't take
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
exception to that either we were trying
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
to be consistent again working with the
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
nhcu the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
Labor we are trying to be consistent
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
with language through out um codified
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
statute but we do not take exception to
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
that it was really the time and wage
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
piece we would like to continue the um
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
ability to credit our students for their
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
educational experience that they receive
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
while they are students on our campuses
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
as resident assistants and I I also want
 
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.349 align:start position:0%
as resident assistants and I I also want
to

00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
mention this is by no means intended to
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism to
 
00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:31.910 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism to
prohibit

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
unionization collective bargaining
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
agreements the
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
plrb retains authority to determine what
 
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
groups May organize and this was never
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
the intention of bringing this forward
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
it was really about keeping the status
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
quo and allowing our students to receive
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
free room and board without taxation at
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the semester and in
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
enjoying the educational opportunity
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
that an RA experience provides for our
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
students and I'm um let me just go look
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
at my the
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
questions I think I tried to answer some
 
01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:12.039 align:start position:0%
of the questions I heard while I was
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
sitting here I'm happy to answer any
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
other questions um that you may have
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh one maybe if you
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
could address a question from a fellow
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
member Within the state there's
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
probably any number of models for how
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
this position would would operate and uh
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
the language to me looks kind of black
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
and white you're either an employee or
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
you shall not be an employee have you
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
considered how this might interact with
 
01:00:50.349 --> 01:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
a a university that doesn't have a
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
strict room and board but may offer some
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
kind of stien or other uh financial
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
compensation that goes with this I I so
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
I'll my quick answer is no I would I
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
would guess that we need to look at
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
Federal do do laws relative to a stipend
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
compensation and also probably refer to
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
the State Department of
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
Labor thank you representative
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you for addressing adding
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
the college work study issue is that
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
still because I went to college 33 years
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
ago um is that still uh assigned based
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
on your financial need and is there any
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
Financial need consideration with uh
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
with Ras so let me answer your your
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
first question first so yes College work
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
study is part of a financial aid package
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
and does consider need and there could
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
be number of roles that a student could
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
apply for uh work on the campus that is
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
funded by work study you could be in the
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
book store you could be in the dining
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
hall you could work in athletics you
 
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:12.039 align:start position:0%
would receive a W2 for that work um on
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
the ra
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
position Financial need is not
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily considered there are
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications I think you need to be a
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
you need to be at least a sophomore you
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
have to maintain a 2.5 GPA and and other
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
um qualifications but uh I don't believe
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
need is necessarily part of that
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
calculus thank you further questions
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative St thank you um when I
 
01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
watched the um hearing for the Senate um
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
the the person speaking for the
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
University system said that there was a
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
situation at Plymouth State College
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
which you also refer to where there was
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
some special program that Ouray at
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State participated in um that
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
was what ran a foul of the Department of
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
Labor could you give us um some some a a
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
broader explanation of that so that we
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
can understand what happened there and
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
why this law is needed everywhere
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
because of that special program thank
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
you it was the it was the if if memory
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
serves and if if you don't mind our
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
general council is behind me so I've
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
misspeak I hope you you wouldn't mind if
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
he corrects me um if memory serves
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state was providing
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
stipend on top of room and board
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
which one should receive a W2 for a
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
stipend and that was getting um sideways
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
the the federal guidelines and the
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
employee so there were and I get
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor here is here also
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and they obviously conducted the in
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
inspection but I believe that was part
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
of we we we were doing both and
 
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.549 align:start position:0%
of we we we were doing both and
shouldn't

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
suan um I think you partially addressed
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
this already but um can you explain why
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
you would include discrimination in the
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
workplace among those aspects of uh
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
workplace rights that are being removed
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
by this bill and as long as I'm added
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
also workers compensation as I said
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
earlier that again the I when the bill
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
was put together we're trying uh trying
 
01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
to be consistent across all statutes
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
that Define
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
employee but again we do not take
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
exception to
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
removing those pieces of the bill on the
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
on the workers we're we're primarily
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
focused on the wage and hour portion of
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
Statute follow follow um Senator Ganon
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
did um testify briefly about the section
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
six um which is no longer here um it was
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
amended out of the bill and
 
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
um it from what I saw in the Senate
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
hearing it appeared that um Deputy um uh
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
um commissioner um Richard lers uh came
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
to testify that the um um unemployment
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
is already excluded from um these types
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
of employees um so um I guess I guess my
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
point is that we it appears that it's
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
not a universal kind of thing
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment has already been excluded
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
um we don't have to eliminate all of
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
these pieces so thank you for your
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
McKenzie if
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow there was not one student that
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
want to be an RA on your
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
campus is it a position that is
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
important enough that you would have to
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
go to the market to fill those positions
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and the critical point of
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
that is those federal guidelines that we
 
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
have been following since 1993 would not
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
exempt those people because there would
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
be no educ they
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
educational component because they
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
students so yes we would have to
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we would have to go to market they
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
would be employees but they would not be
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
receiving an educational opportunity as
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
as a student on one of our
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
campuses F the question follow up um as
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
it relates to workers compensation there
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
were two parts of comp which is
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
indemnity and then there's a medical St
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
so if they if they're not um employees
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
under your
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines um they would not be eligible
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
for workers compensation so if you take
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
them out of that that
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
stream so you could
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
potentially and I'm ask you if you've
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
thought through this that what would
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
happen if somebody if an IRA was hurt in
 
01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
the performance of their
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
disabled what if they're out of the
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
workers comp
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
system and understand if they're out of
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
the comp system they're
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
also um they're also able to I believe
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
and comp will answer this Su the
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
university system because once you deny
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
them work as compensation the Qui pro
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
quo is that they have the the authority
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
to cor so I I don't if you thought that
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
through but if somebody was injured I
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
would think that you want to make sure
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
they were taken care of and I would
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
suggest that this bill's not doing that
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
maybe your attorney is can respond to
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
that again we do not take exception to
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
removing the workers compensation
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
section of this bill um I believe
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability to sue
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
us regardless they don't oh if they were
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
part of workers comp you mean they
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't sue us again we do not take
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
bill represent
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
Susie thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
for taking the
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
question when the bill was being thought
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
about or written was it ever taken into
 
01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.229 align:start position:0%
about or written was it ever taken into
consideration

01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
um that a one siiz
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
fits-all may not work here because it
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
appears that there are other
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
universities across the state of New
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that do pay the RAS um so I'm
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
not sure that a one size fits all so is
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
this is this something you you guys
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
actually looked at at that point when
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
you was being written we
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
were again the goal was to keep status
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
quo with the federal
 
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.789 align:start position:0%
quo with the federal
guidelines

01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
and align State Statute with the federal
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines that colleges and
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
decades representative Kum thank you Mr
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
question going back to um what
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie asked if you did
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
not have any students who were
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
interested in this Ro and you did have
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
to go to market would you also provide
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
as a benefit to that hired person free
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
room in board or would that be
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
considered part of their compensation
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
package if you went to Market if we went
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
to Market um we would likely have to
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
provide free room if it was a
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
requirement that they live on campus
 
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
presumably they would but we would not
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
follow up followup please yes um so the
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
free room is would that be again non-
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
student non-educational requirement
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
would that be considered imputed income
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
so would they have to report that as
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
income as well I believe it's a
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
requirement do can answer this better
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
than I I believe if we require them to
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I would like clarification
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
from the do if I could please on
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
that any further
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
workers from Dartmouth College many of
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
them who are also residential
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
advisers um so we were initially very
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
shocked to learn about Senate Bill 517
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
which legally delegitimizes the
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
important work of Resident assistant and
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
it declares that we are not employees um
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
just to establish the status quo
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
nationally residential assistants are
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
considered employees so this bill
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
effectively seeks to remove them from
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
that employee status just to reiterate
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
Ras are currently identified as
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
employees um we're here today taking
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
time out of our classes we're missing
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
classes right now um to testify against
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
this bill because we believe that
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
policies related to students and in this
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
case residential advisors need to have
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
input from those very workers um and
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing here today
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
before I share the mic to um with my
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
fellow student workers I want to read a
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted by a UNH resident
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
adviser by the name of Emily who
 
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't join us
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
today she says I have in my three years
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
of attending the University of New
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire held over five different
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
positions working alongside for the
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
University doing everything from handing
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
out letters in the mail room to editing
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
essays in the Connor's Writing Center in
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
that time no position has been as
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
intensive as my position as a resident
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
assistant multiple days of training on
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
everything from how to handle roommate
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
disputes to sexual assaults have taken
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
up the last two weeks of my summer for
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
the past 2 years as well as the final
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
selection of my January break and the
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory 2hour weekly meetings with my
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
supervisor and co-workers to refresh
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
information often and for good reason
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
while on duty I have to be prepared to
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
be the immediate responder to things as
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
small as noise complaints to as major as
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
sitting with a student while they
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
describe in visceral detail suicidal
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
fantasies to Psychological Services so
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
we can see how this role has changed
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
over the years even while I'm not on
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
duty I'm often never off the clock I
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
have weekly meetings with my supervisor
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
where I am briefed on new information
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
and asked to set goals on how to push
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
myself and do more in my role I hang
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
flyers on bulletin boards run weekly
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
activities for my residents and I have
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
to be cognizant of the state of over 45
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
people even outside of my building I am
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
not just a student as I am a mandatory
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
reporter for sexual assaults 24/7 even
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
if the student disclosing does not know
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
that in my capacity as an
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
RA this testimony is not intended to
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
demean the ra rule as along with being
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
one of the most challenging roles on the
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
UNH campus it has also been one of the
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
most rewarding but to deny me as an
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
employee of the university in this
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
capacity would be an insult to the work
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
you my name is gwendelyn Roland and I'm
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
a junior at Dartmouth College I've
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
served in the position as a Dartmouth we
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
call it undergraduate advisor but
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
basically an R for the past two years um
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to speak to a little
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
bit of the day-to-day and on the ground
 
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of a UG and an RA today
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
um so we do get hired um we have to go
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
through a lengthy interview process and
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
then after that we conduct about a week
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
and a half of training um and two days
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
of re refresher training before each
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
term so Dartmouth we're on quarters um
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
and we're also re-up on those trainings
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
during our weekly staff meetings every
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
week every Thursday um we also conduct
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly checkin meetings with our
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
supervisors um and as well as that we
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
have shifts where we walk through the
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
dorm buildings making sure that
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
everything is generally okay um we're
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
also as Emily um to reiterate her
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
testimony for UNH said um we're mandated
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
reporters as well um and we are on the
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
clock 24/7 to be available to students
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
um in our dorms by cell phone by email
 
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
if somebody has an issue big or small we
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
are their first point of contact and we
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
are also their first point of we're also
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
the administration's first point of
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
helping students who might not come to
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
us um so if we suspect any abuse as
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
mandate reporter we are also required to
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
report that even if a student has not
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
come to us we hear things we live in the
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
dorms and living in the dorms and having
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
our board paid for which to clarify as
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
well at Dartmouth um our compensation
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
for being ugas is a stipended which we
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
are taxed on we do receive a W2 at
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um and as well we receive a um
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
compensation for a credit we receive a
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
meal crit credit for a meal plan the
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
lowest um meal plan on campus the one
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
that is least expensive that you can
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
have while living full-time on campus
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
and not in an apartment with a kitchen
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
um and we do not receive compensation
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
for room um but we have to be on campus
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
and our room and our board are not
 
01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily part of our compensation but
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
rather the materials to do our job
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
effectively and well
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can also pass it off to Rowan
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
to speak a little bit more on the
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
necessity of being First Responders to
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
student mental health and sexual assault
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
crises hi thank you all for your time um
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
I want to speak to the importance of
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
employee status when it comes to dealing
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
with the issues that residential
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
advisers have to deal with often on a
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
daily basis I do want to acknowledge
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
that this is not a job that can be build
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
hourly but most jobs that involve care
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
labor cannot be build hourly um and to
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
preface this I want to speak to my own
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
experiences um with my personal ug my
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
freshman year um I as well as many other
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
students um experienced sexual violence
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and I was Reliant in my ug to walk me
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
through the process um without countless
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
hours of her labor I don't know how I
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
would have gotten through it she could
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
not have been build hourly for all the
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
time that she put into supporting me
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
because one that would have been dozens
 
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
of hours that I'm sure the college would
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
not have wanted to pay um and so part of
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
this is ugas have to navigate systems
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
that aren't well set up um and so part
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
of what we are trying to do as employees
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
and using employee protections is to
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
reform these systems to better protect
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
ugas when it comes to dealing with
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
issues of sexual assault and mental
 
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.310 align:start position:0%
issues of sexual assault and mental
health

01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.030 align:start position:0%
health
crises

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
crises
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
um and to that I want to comment on the
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
previous point that was made um during
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
previous testimony about this bill being
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
a union busting
 
01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.790 align:start position:0%
a union busting
bill

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
um as you may or may not know ugas um
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
and residential advisers across the
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
country have been uh unionizing not just
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
to get better compensation but to get
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
better employee protections because we
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
have to deal with unprecedented levels
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
of Mental Health crisis and with sexual
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
assaults Dartmouth has some of the
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
highest sexual assault rates in the
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
country and this is something that um ug
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
have to deal with um and they're not
 
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
properly supported by our institution
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the current policies that are set up
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
and so part of what we are trying to do
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
through um better protecting our
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
employees and by unionizing is to
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
develop systems that can better support
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
people who have experienced sexual
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
violence and are dealing with Mental
 
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.709 align:start position:0%

Health
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
crisis we are really really deeply
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is a bill that will
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
jeopardize people's safety
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
um by not allowing us to utilize our
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
status as employees to better advocate
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
for our residents and for ourselves as
 
01:21:20.679 --> 01:21:28.310 align:start position:0%

do not fulfill the required
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and again we want to
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
highlight that we do receive Dar the W2
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
tax forms with our income recorded we
 
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.470 align:start position:0%

are

01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
employees thank you for your testimony
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question you mentioned
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
that it isn't easy to determine hourly
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
commitment to this job um do you know
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
how your
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
University calculates hourly
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
compensation and establishes require or
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
employees thank you for that question um
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
so it differs per school but when it
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
comes to Dartmouth College um our hours
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
or our responsibilities are clearly
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
enumerated and they estimate that it's
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
about 15 to 20 hours a week they don't
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
reveal the methods and as we can see it
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
differs per residential advisor or ug in
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
this case undergraduate advisor um but
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
they say at minimum it is at least 20
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
hours a week
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair thank you all
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimonies and for what you do
 
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
at the campus uh it's it's definitely
 
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
not an easy job and I appreciate your
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
work the um the stiping you get does
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
that include going to the trainings and
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
the meetings that you have weekly
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
go we do not get paid for the trainings
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
the dipen does not include the trainings
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe that our um bi-weekly
 
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
check-ins with our supervisors and our
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
weekly meetings are included in that at
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
least 20 hours a week um calculation but
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
again the college is not transparent
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
with exactly how they calculate that
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
number also to add on to that Dartmouth
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
Bard thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I I just want
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
to make it this
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
point clear that you are
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
considered employees by the Dartmouth
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
model OKAY follow up follow up please
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
and that model is shared with an awful
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
lot of other universities throughout the
 
01:24:54.119 --> 01:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
lot of other universities throughout the
country

01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
further follow okay and so this bill
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
would be a unique
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
bill that would affect you
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
tremendously and the rest of the country
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
as well sets a standard if it were to
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
pass an inaccurate standard in
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
representation of our work thank
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
Kum thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony today and thank you for
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um regarding the
 
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
training uh sessions that you guys have
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
to attend in those meetings with your
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
supervisors would you consider that part
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
of the educational benefit that you're
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
getting um in preparing yourself on on
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce training and everything else
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
benefit I would like I work several jobs
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
on campus um and I think that I benefit
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
educationally from all of
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
them that's all I'm going to say about
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
that I would also like to add many
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
things can coexist we can find
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
educational fulfillment in our work as
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
residential assistants but that has to
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
be paired with a serious consideration
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
of us as employees so both of these
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
things can coexist at the same time
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
Schultz this is a quick one um based on
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
the representation here today I can we
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
assume that the majority of the raas on
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
your campus are women or non
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
nonbinary but probably mostly women
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
handle I don't have the exact statistics
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but it is a a job
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
disproportionately um fulfilled by women
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
and non-binary people um often times
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
because we are at the Forefront of these
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
issues on campus funny how that works
 
01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.550 align:start position:0%
issues on campus funny how that works
thank

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you and thank you for
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
coming today and missing class and all
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
those other things that you that you had
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
to do get here today thank you so
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
much so you mentioned uh that there are
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
other jobs that you do within the
 
01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:26.350 align:start position:0%
other jobs that you do within the
university

01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
system uh are the other jobs um are they
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
hourly jobs so you you compensated on an
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:41.629 align:start position:0%
 
jobs

01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes I can um speak to that I think all
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
of us work multiple jobs here um this is
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
a a job position that often is fulfilled
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
by working class and low-income people
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
and so we do have to work multiple jobs
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
I work several jobs some are paid via
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
stiens some are paid hourly um but all
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
jobs yeah depends again all of us here
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
work several jobs uh I am an
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
international student so I I need all
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
the jobs to afford to live in this
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
country and to come and to commute from
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
from Brazil my home country some of the
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
jobs we work are early paid and some are
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
not some such as research which which
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
still constitutes as
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
work follow up follow up you mentioned
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility for
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
ra is a
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
24-hour uh
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility so can we assume that you
 
01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
could get calls at 3:00 in the
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
morning um could you get calls when
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
you're do another job correct and could
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
we could I ask you how you resolve those
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
conflicts if you're working someplace
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
els for pay and all of a sudden you get
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
an ra ra call how do you how do you
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
issues I think it would naturally depend
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the issue um I have gotten knocks on
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
my door at 3:00 a.m. and sometimes I
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
have woken up and sometimes I have not
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
um in terms of if I'm working an hourly
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
job and I get a call I think it would
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
definitely depend on what the call is
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
and depend on what job I'm working I'm
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
very lucky and most of the hourly jobs
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I do work at Dartmouth um have
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful supervisors and so if I told
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
them that a resident needed my help most
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
of the time I could clock out early and
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
I think that if it was serious enough I
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
would final follow follow so can you
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
describe what the what it's like to be
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh on call 24 hours a day in a very busy
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh University and
 
01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
so because not many jobs on call 24
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
way um honestly it can get hectic um but
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
we were told when we apply and when we
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
interview that this is the nature of the
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
job so it wonderfully attracts uh people
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
who are prepared for this um on top of
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
that we the day-to-day looks like as
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
Gwen had acknowledged before for um
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
keeping our our phone open our email
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
open our communication lines open so we
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
move daytoday um recognizing that this
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
is a very this is an important reality
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
and we're prepared for
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
that and one final question Mr chairman
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
do you think there's value um to having
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
you this
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
consistent um relationship with the
 
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
students throughout the thing as opposed
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
to a private system where potentially
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
you could have all kinds of people
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
rotating through the the college system
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
is there value in the in that consistent
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
kind of support that you provide in that
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
AR um yes especially given the nature of
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
the job when you're dealing with um
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
mental health crises and sexual violence
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
you need to have you know relationships
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
built up with your residents built up in
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
a way that they trust you enough to talk
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
to you about about these issues and I
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
think that also speaks to the inadequacy
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
of a lot of other systems that are in
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
place on campus to support people with
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
these issues and why our position is so
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
needed I would also like to speak to the
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
particularity of each campus um in terms
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
of where you can find the resources they
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
might not always be standardized it's
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
very helpful to have somebody who really
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
understands what it's like being a
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
student at that organization um in terms
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
of knowing the acronyms knowing knowing
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
the language um and things of that
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
nature I would also like to say that our
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
supervisor our direct supervisor
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
position um at Dartmouth specifically
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
has a lot of turnover and it negatively
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
affects the ability with which they are
 
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
able to do the job and it also yes
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
Kum thank you again thank you again for
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um with regard to the
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
other jobs that you you guys are holding
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
or other jobs that you're even aware of
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
that maybe you're not holding are there
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
other jobs on the campus that provide
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
free room and board or something that's
 
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
comparable to free roomin board as far
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
as the value that I'm assuming that it's
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
quite a substantial value getting free
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
roomin board in a year of your your
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
college um attendance so is there
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind you that
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth students are not um
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
compensated with a room credit we do not
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
get our room paid for we still pay the
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
housing that we
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
are if you are not on financial aid then
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
you would pay the sticker price for
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
housing um if you are a ug at Dartmouth
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
um some
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
research I think I'm I I think um
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
does get up to that amount and also if
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
you um there are shorter term positions
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
that provide um room and board in terms
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
of supporting darmouth reunions and
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
darmouth commencement which I have
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
fulfilled um which
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
yeah any further questions
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
as I've heard from multiple Witnesses
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh you must be you you must have
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
attended the school at least for one
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
year before you can apply to be an RA
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
correct follow up so that you have no
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
idea when you're applying for colleges
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
if you'll have this opportunity if
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
you'll be in ra or have some other jobs
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
you just know that you want to go to
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
that school and what it might cost you
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
correct and and follow up and and
 
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
further that the opportunities uh you
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
you have to serve you have to live on
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
campus and you have to be available all
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
the time there's no way to calculate
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
really what your hours are uh it seems
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
it would be unreasonable to have an
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
hourly an hourly uh relationship there I
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know where the I want anxious to
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
hear from the department but you uh you
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
have other opportunities such as perhaps
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
in your graduate year to be to be
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
teaching and you're still not considered
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
an employee is that
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
correct or are you an employee if you're
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
teaching if you're a grad student and
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
class you're not there yet right are you
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
speaking to um like graduate students
 
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
PhD and master students right and can
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
you repeat your question for us please
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
yes so if you are you you're a grad
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
student and you're teaching lower class
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
taking really doing the job of Faculty
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
your ad grad student faculty and you're
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
teaching do are you considered an
 
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.270 align:start position:0%
teaching do are you considered an
employee

01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
then so grad students are still
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
considered employees especially if they
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
are teaching assistants in fact many
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
programs come with a stipend so the
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
stipend sort of model is not unique to
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
just undergraduate students residential
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
advisers but also carries through um to
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
The Graduate Community thanks very much
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%

familiar with nhcu it's a um Consortium
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
of most of the colleges both public and
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
private institutions of higher education
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
in our state and these institutions are
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
recognized and highly regarded for their
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
outstanding teaching research community
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
service activities as well and they
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
serve as major centers of activity that
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
are vital to the economic development
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
and Workforce Development of the
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
community and our
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
state s SP 517 seeks to Simply provide
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
much needed clarification ation of the
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
employment status of college and
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
university St uh students serving as
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
resident assistants and in other
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
educational programs our members
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate and support this effort to
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
make this important distinction for
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
those students working in these
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
educational programs the nhcu member
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
institutions actively seek to offer our
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
students multiple opportunities to
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
offset expanses rather expenses related
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
to college attendance and I think uh
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
earlier Senator Ganon did a great job of
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
kind of outlining his um own experience
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
and those of his children serving as
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
resident assistants and that can be
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
certainly one strategy to help make
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
College more affordable and this
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
clarification between the federal
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
guidance and our local laws will ensure
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
the students who may not have this
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
financial means to live on campus may be
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
able to explore that option and that's
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
experience our colleges and universities
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
will also directly benefit as a passage
 
01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
of SB 517 will better will allow for
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
better alignment between the federal
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
guidance which was enacted under the
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
Clinton Administration and our state
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
guidance as it relates to the employment
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
status of students working in
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
educational programs according to the
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
federal guidance students enrolled in
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
Bonafide educational programs who are
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
reg residential assistants and receive
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
reduced room or board charges or tuition
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
credits are not generally considered
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
employees under the
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
flsa this federal and state alignment
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
will be helpful to our institutions and
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
especially to those who have campuses in
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
multiple States further it will
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
streamline the operations it will reduce
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
administrative costs while also leading
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
to cost savings for our institutions and
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
far more importantly our students and
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
their families thank you thank you very
 
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
much um I do have a question so in the
 
01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.950 align:start position:0%
much um I do have a question so in the
last

01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard a description of how
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth operates and it sounds to me
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
like at that University they've created
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
a model for this position that's
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
different from the traditional ra
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
Arrangement and in fact is an employee
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
like position so my question
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
is when you have uh a change in law that
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
says this shall be an employee and this
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
shall not does it take into
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
consideration perhaps another model that
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
might exist that that doesn't match the
 
01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.629 align:start position:0%
might exist that that doesn't match the
either

01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
or I'm not an attorney and you will hear
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
from attorney in a in a minute or two on
 
01:40:08.189 --> 01:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
this but it seems to me that what we're
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
seeing is that there's a lot of
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility perhaps at the federal level
 
01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
to Define it in many ways and I think a
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of that has already come out
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
in this hearing this morning and I think
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
what the idea is behind sort of the
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
alignment is to allow for Flex a little
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
bit more flexibility perhaps than we've
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
previously seen and we just want to um
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
just continue I think of what's been
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
working in the state um and as uh Miss
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
prenter said earlier you know really
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
talking about status
 
01:40:42.589 --> 01:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
quo thank you further questions
 
01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative Susi thank you Mr
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
question I'm G to go back to your
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony it says our college
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
and university will directly benefit of
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
the passage of sb517
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
is it's taken the university system of
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to come many years to come
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
to this point with this um
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislation um and other than besides
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that they want to come on board
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
with the federal and or align themselves
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
with the feds um is there a bigger
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
problem has this with what you're doing
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
now is this created a a problem for the
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
University system because it doesn't
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
appear that it's been a problem until
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
now so is there is there an issue is
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
there a larger problem yeah I don't
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
believe so we've you know certainly in
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
talking with our campuses and so forth
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that it's it's working
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
fine but you know um some additional
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
sort of clarification um is necessary
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the point that we're
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually at right now you representative
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
Solen thank you for taking my question
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not familiar with the New
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh college and university
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
Council um does that include all of the
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities in the state
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it includes uh
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
certainly the university system is one
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
of our members the private colleges with
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
the exception of Dartmouth uh Thomas
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
Moore and Magdalene College I may have
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%

01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%

privilege of working with a number of
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
college students um in ways that have
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
been truly inspirational for me and in
 
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
this capacity working with students I
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
just happen to stumble over Senate Bill
 
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
517 um which to me came across as a very
 
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
odd Bill to try to change labor law to
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
declare at New Hampshire colleges or
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
universities that undergraduate resident
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hall advisers or assistants should be
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
excluded from the definition of employee
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
in certain labor laws so I was curious
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
what the heck is this so I attended the
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing to figure out what was
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
going on and folks from the University
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire were the key advocates
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the bill and try as I might though I
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
could not figure out what the problem
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
was that they were trying to address and
 
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
typically in New Hampshire we don't like
 
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
to pass laws if there's no reason to if
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's no problem that needs to be
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with that's sort of not our way um
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony um mentioned in my
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
recollection mentioned um hourly wages
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe the challenge of tracking
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
hours worked but the reality is and and
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
this has been mentioned that the federal
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
fair labor standards act already tells
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities that they
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the minimum wage or an
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
hourly wage and they don't have to pay
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
overtime uh for Resident advisers or
 
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
resident assistants they can if they
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
want but they don't have to so if that
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
is already federal law that that
 
01:44:59.950 --> 01:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities including in
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire both public and private
 
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay an hourly wage or
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the minimum wage and
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's already covered what is the
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
problem what is the problem here that we
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
are trying to deal with with a new bill
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire legislature and and
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
to this moment and even hearing the
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I still can't figure it out
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
and even in terms of tracking hours in
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
this day and age of Technology of high
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
technology we've already seen from other
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
college campuses that it's not difficult
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
to track the hours of an RA if you need
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
to or if you want to um so the original
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
version of Senate Bill 517 also asserted
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
that um resident um assistants or
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
advisers that it was just an
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activity but you know
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was so far removed from reality
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
that even the Senate Commerce Committee
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
and its wisdom said we need to take this
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
out this is not a an extra curric
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
activity this is a job the other thing I
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
want to just mention just from hearing
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony the ra of 100 years ago is
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
not the ra of today the ra of 40 years
 
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
ago is not the Raa of today and every
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
job if done well or every job done by a
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated worker who wants to do their
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
job well provides Educational
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
Opportunity it's not just this job it's
 
01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
all work provides an opportunity to
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
learn and to train and to grow if you
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
want um so the the truth is the reality
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
31-year-old exclusion that exists today
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
in the fair uh Fair Labor sta uh acts
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
Fair labor standards acts wage and hour
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
component um is really from another era
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it absolutely doesn't reflect the um
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
the demanding R job of today and so as
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
far back as
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
2011 uh there's a I I found a um a
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
national law firm that's sort of
 
01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
tracking these things nationally and
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 they advised their educ
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
institution clientele by way of a
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
newsletter um that the understanding of
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
the job of Ra was evolving and again the
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
in 2017 so quite a while ago the
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
National Labor Relations Board ruled
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
that Ras were indeed employees based
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
specifically on things that they looked
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
at that the duties that they uh that
 
01:47:17.589 --> 01:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
they performed specific services in
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
exchange for compensation of some kind
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
compensation varies in its model from
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
from college or campus to campus but
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
that they uh Ras receive compensation um
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
they they job again this is what the
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
National Labor Relations Board um in its
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
ruling said ra job duties and
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
expectations are carefully outlined in
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
some detail these individuals are
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
supervised by college or university
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
staff they're subject to discipline up
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
to an including termination there's
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
written documentation of their hiring in
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
their work agreement with work
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
expectations excluded and these are
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
employee elements if this isn't an
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
employee folks then what is and I did
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
interesting thing so I looked up what
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
UNH has to say about raas and they start
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
off by saying that Ras are
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional staff members is a Prof
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
a paraprofessional staff member an
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
employee or is it not um so I looked up
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
three colleges I looked up UNH I looked
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
up Dartmouth and I looked up New England
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
college and I I'll give you just some of
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
the things that I pulled out that that
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh provision after provision and the
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
things that these these colleges and
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
these campuses have put in writing
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
screams out these are employees these
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
follow the definition of
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
employee and um so in their own words
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
just take their own words for what they
 
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:38.350 align:start position:0%
just take their own words for what they
are

01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
um so and so I I won't go into that
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm GNA give you everything but
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
just how can I when I looked at just
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
those three colleges
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
I just asked myself and I ask you to ask
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
yourselves looking at what they say
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
about who raas are what they do what
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
they're expected to do how they're hired
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
that they are faced with firing that
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
they are compensated how can anybody
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
with a straight face say but that's not
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
an employee and so the question is if
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're not an employee what are they I
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
know that there are a number of people
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
in this committee who are very familiar
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
with issues of workfor worker
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
misclassification and you know want to
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
be very careful about that I know this
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
is something that's come before the
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee a lot but we shouldn't be
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
going back to the dark ages of
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
misclassification so um I just want to
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
read um just in closing um a publication
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
called inside higher ed published an
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
article about um campus undergraduate
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
resident assistance um in
 
01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
2022 and this was after talking with
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
some Ras from across the country I sent
 
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
people out they did some interviews
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
across the country country and the
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
article included their article included
 
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
these comments resident assistants also
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
known as resident advisors Community
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%

01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%

administration of residential life at
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%

compensation for these roles
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
varies from free or reduced room and
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
board to stiens or hourly wages every ra
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
or CA that spoke to inside higher ed
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
said that as student workers they
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
shoulder too heavy a burden and work far
 
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
more hours than the job should entail
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
moreover they said they aren't given the
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
respect or the compensation they deserve
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
every student worker interviewed for
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
this article said that while they enjoy
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
organizing community events and helping
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
their peers being an RA was for them a
 
01:51:01.069 --> 01:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
job they saw themselves as an employee
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
of their institution a job that felt
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
that they felt was rewarding but whose
 
01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.639 align:start position:0%
main purpose was to help them and their
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
families earn a living or make ends meet
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
this is our livelihood they said so
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
these student workers um as you'll see
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the handout that I'll give you
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
reflect all all the elements of being
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
employees and this bill is so confusing
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
in its um contradictions that I would
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
just say J it's not ready for uh prime
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
time and it really does need to be met
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
with inexpedient to legislate so thank
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony are
 
01:51:41.639 --> 01:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony are

questions seeing none thank you again
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
next up I would like to call Claudia
 
01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:51.639 align:start position:0%
stelle um speaking in opposition to the
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
yourself good morning chair and members
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee and thank you for
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I did email it to
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
everyone earlier because my printer
 
01:52:20.069 --> 01:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't being cooperative um I live in
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
aworth I'm Claudia stelle I'm a member
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the economic Justice Mission group of
 
01:52:26.189 --> 01:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Conference of the
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
United Church of Christ um this bill
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
seeks to specify that a particular group
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
University students um who including
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
students serving as resident Hall assoc
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
assistants or dormatory counselors who
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
are participating in a Bonafide
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
educational program are not considered
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
employees under New Hampshire labor law
 
01:52:51.629 --> 01:52:51.639 align:start position:0%
and I find this disturbing for several
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
reasons um first as we've pointed it
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
this has been pointed out many times
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
already is that the students who are
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
serving as resident Hall assistants are
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
going through a process of that would
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
classify them as employees under any
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
other sector of the economy they have to
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
be interviewed they have to they have to
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
apply they're interviewed they're hired
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
supervised um they have to meet
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
expectations they can be disciplined
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
including being fire if they don't meet
 
01:53:23.719 --> 01:53:24.589 align:start position:0%
including being fire if they don't meet
those

01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
expectations um
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
and they um and they have to meet a set
 
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
schedule of time commitment and they
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
receive compensation so in any other
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
area of the economy that's the
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
definition of an employee second of all
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
the Resident assistant as we've heard of
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
today have totally different
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and and a much more
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
complicated um set of responsibilities
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
than those of some of us of a certain
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
age and including myself who maybe in
 
01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
our experienc resident assistance um
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
help people get into their room with the
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
door was locked they'd lock their key
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
inside or if uh they were told to turn
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
down their music to be considerate of
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
other people um but the other thing
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's I think is really important and
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not positive
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
has been emphasized enough is that in
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
those situations of decades ago there
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
was also um the college hired
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
experienced adults to be in charge of
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
the dormatory to live either in the
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
dormatory OR nearby to handle more
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
serious issues today's resident
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
assistants um are asked to be exemplary
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
leaders and models of conial inter um
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
interpersonal interactions they are to
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
set a friendly and comfortable um tone
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
for a dorm lifestyle they're expected to
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
organize activities based on students
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
interests they cope with problems
 
01:55:07.069 --> 01:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
between roommates they um support the
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
college rules and policies they
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
cooperate with campus security to
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
maintain safety they help enforce
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
College Health and Welfare policies and
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
to be prepared to do all those things
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
they're required to do a lot of training
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
and also have um periodic supervised
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
meetings they're both trusted allies and
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
they are enforcers of the rules and
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
they're likely as we've heard many times
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
to be the first person to help students
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
cope with physical or mental illness
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
they may be the first person to respond
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
to a student who's been sexually
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
assaulted or has overdosing from
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
drugs the college would be very
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
hardpressed to serve their students well
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
outside of the classroom without having
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
people like resident assistants to help
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
students during the night and over the
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
weekends third is that they are often
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
overworked and undercompensated oops
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
my well I'll just go for my notes um we
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
already know that they are are required
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
to work to supervise or be um a number
 
01:56:21.719 --> 01:56:22.790 align:start position:0%
to work to supervise or be um a number
of

01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
dormatory students sometimes somewhere
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 50 they have to um be on
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
be specifically in the dorm at certain
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
hours plus they're on call me um and
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
have to be on campus during special
 
01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
weekends um so that they are
 
01:56:42.079 --> 01:56:45.310 align:start position:0%
weekends um so that they are
available

01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
apologize um they also need this job to
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
make ends meet and we've heard from the
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
from the dart withth withth women that
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
they hold many jobs on campus I would
 
01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
say that going to school is a full-time
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
job and that working as a resident ass
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
assistant is is a a part-time job and
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
that that's more than enough to do I'm a
 
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
an adjunct in the community college
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire and I can say
 
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
that students I the students I see hold
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
have staggering load on their plates
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
they attend classes they work they
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
support they are they have families
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
children Elders that they care for and
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
they're financially insecure and they're
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
challenging themselves educationally I
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
don't see I I think that our resident
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
Associates who are doing this job to
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
make ends meet to be able to attend to
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
afford to attend college
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
they need to have the the security of
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
being employees and all of the benefits
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
that come with that my fourth point is
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
that if we're carving out one set of
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
employees to or one set of workers to
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
not be considered employees who's the
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
next group that we're that's going to be
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
cons going to
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
be Declassified if you will and finally
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
um I would ask how would raas who are
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
hired in these colleges know that
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're not employees if this law passes
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
because I would say that those students
 
01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
all of their work experiences have been
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
as employees and if they are being
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
interviewed for a job they're being
 
01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
given specific uh duties and specific
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
times requirements to be there and
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
compensation whether it's monetary or
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
not or not that they would understand
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
that it's being employees who's going to
 
01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:54.679 align:start position:0%
tell them that they're not employees
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
because that might it change how they
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
how they think about the the position so
 
01:59:01.229 --> 01:59:01.239 align:start position:0%
with all of that I would encourage you
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
to vote this itl please thank you for
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you again
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
thanks uh the last card that I have for
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is from Danielle Albert uh
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor they are not taking
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Danielle Albert
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
I'm the Deputy Commissioner of the New
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor I'm here
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
today with our General councel John
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
garrian um we will try to be brief uh
 
01:59:41.069 --> 01:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
I'm anticipating some questions so in
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
general uh as representative seaworth
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
noted the department doesn't take a
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we are neither
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
neither in support of it nor in
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to it we have reviewed the
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
language um of the bill we're familiar
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
with it U We believe We Understand its
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
stated intent um have also heard from
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
and and had some correspondence with the
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
university system we understand their
 
02:00:03.310 --> 02:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
expressed need uh for for the um that
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
was the impetus for uh this language in
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
some what we understand the language to
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
be doing and and it is a very brief
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
summary it is creating an exemption to
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
the uh definition of employee in RSA 275
 
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
at three specific points sections 4
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
sections 36 and sections 42 um it is
 
02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
also creating uh an ex uh exemption to
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
the definition of employee and RSA
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
2791 which is relative to minimum wage
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
payment and it is creating an exemption
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
in the workers compensation statute uh
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
to the presumption of employment um
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
which falls under the definition of uh
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
employee and there were some questions I
 
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
I think uh perhaps representative
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
McKenzie and maybe representative
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan as well um had asked how that
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
worked on in the workers compensation
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
context we understand the proposed
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
language to be removing um the
 
02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
presumption that applies uh all all
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
individuals with the exception of the
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
specifically enumerated or presumed to
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
be employees under the workers
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
compensation statute so it's not a
 
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
blanket um carve out that you are barred
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
from the workers compensation system but
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
it is removing the benefit of that
 
02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
presumption from this class of employee
 
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
um and we are so that's our
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of the of the language um
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands we're happy to
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that there may be
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh so questions I'll
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
start with representative
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you um thank you for
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
taking the question um I'm not sure I
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
followed What You indicated on the
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
workers compensation
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
um the way let me see if I can rephrase
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
from I heard you say that the it removes
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
the presumption that they are employeed
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
so as it stands now if someone filed a
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
worker's comp claim as an RA it would be
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
presumed they're an employee and they
 
02:01:56.069 --> 02:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
would um if their situation warranted it
 
02:01:59.069 --> 02:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
they would be covered by the uh workers
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
compensation that would be correct So
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
currently as it stands um all employees
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
except for direct sellers certain types
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
of residential placement providers and
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
there's a third one in the current um
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
current statute uh which I'm not
 
02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
remembering off the top of my head are
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
not presumed to be employees this would
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
be adding a fourth class of um employee
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
or fourth class of individual who would
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
not be presumed on its face to be an
 
02:02:31.069 --> 02:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
employee under the statute so if the
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
language were to go into effect and an
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
RA or a dorm counselor were to be
 
02:02:37.709 --> 02:02:37.719 align:start position:0%
injured and put forward a workers
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
compensation claim um they would not be
 
02:02:42.069 --> 02:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
presumed on their face to be an employee
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
of the employer and they would carry the
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
burden of demonstrating in a dispute
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
that they actually were one follow
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
follow um how would one go about um
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
proving that they're employee if this
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
went went through what does what does
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
that you know involve yeah that's a very
 
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
very good question it it's going to be I
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
think somewhat fact specific because all
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
jobs you know are different and um but
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
the factors that are listed in the
 
02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
workers compensation statute um
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
typically when someone's presumed to be
 
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
an employee an employer then can rebut
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
that there's something else utilizing
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
those seven specifically enumerated
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
criteria um in this instance the uh
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
purported employee if the language goes
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
through would need to be demonstrating
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
the employer has care and control over
 
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
my my work we've engaged in that uh some
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
kind of employment uh For Hire that has
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
terms uh set for it um they tell me time
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
place uh all of those different factors
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
they would need to bring forward and
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to verify or to prove that
 
02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.790 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to verify or to prove that
they're

02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
employees well again well um different
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh area um I I believe I heard early uh
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
testimony that minimum wage is already
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
excluded um for um these types of
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
employees um first of all is that
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
true so I in my understanding and the
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
crafting of the current language is that
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
part of the intent was to resolve um or
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
or sort of marry up the way that the US
 
02:04:21.149 --> 02:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
do Under the flsa is looking at resident
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
advisers and dorm counselors or
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
Community advisers or whatever term um
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
is used if we look at the US do
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation um as it's set forth
 
02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
through the field operations manual that
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
they utilize um they are I've got the
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
definition here with me so I'm just
 
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to refer to it if you bear with me
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
for one moment um in general they are
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
construing that these raas or dorm
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
counselers who are participating in a
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
Bonafide educational program and who
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
receive remuneration if I pronounce that
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
correct IR ly in the form of reduced
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
room or board free use of telephones
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
tuition credits and the like are not
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
employees under the act so um our
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
understanding uh again in the impetus
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
and from speaking with the University of
 
02:05:07.149 --> 02:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who um had had some hand
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
in crafting of this language was they
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
were looking to resolve how us do is is
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
is treating this type of individual with
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
how the state is so under the current
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
um there are ways and there are
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
certainly scenarios where resident
 
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
advisers or dorm counselors um can be
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
construed as or or fall within the
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
definition of employee for the purposes
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
of minimum wage and other protective
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislation requirements as well as
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
workers compensation as it currently
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
stands um and I think it was Miss
 
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
preventure who had referenced it in her
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony some of the impetus for the
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill um was an interaction that the
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
department had through uh a inspection
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
that was undertaken through the
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
University of of Plymouth University
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
I believe um where there was a
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
determination that Ras had crossed into
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
that line of employment um or were it
 
02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
were employees of the
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
University thank you so I saw a number
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
of hands I'm going to try to catch them
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the order that I saw them and so
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative bushard you had a
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um
 
02:06:13.159 --> 02:06:15.069 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um
representative

02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
Sullivan two of his questions were mine
 
02:06:22.549 --> 02:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
okay G ask him I'm okay okay all right
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
love thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
given that um these Ras have uh have a
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
wide a wide array of responsibilities
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
some uh really going into law
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and uh you know in a case of
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or or EMT uh duties and
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
stuff um if someone were to be hurt by
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh by anra unintentionally or
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally um who would be like
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh to clarify your question are you
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
asking under current iteration of law or
 
02:06:59.709 --> 02:06:59.719 align:start position:0%
if the proposed language were to go into
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
effect both
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
both excellent it's an excellent
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
question so under current iteration of
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
Statute so as as currently written you
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
know if an RA were injured uh in the
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
course of of their um ra duties and they
 
02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
asserted a workers's compensation claim
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to focus on the workers
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
compensation um component first um they
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
could pursue a claim through the routine
 
02:07:26.189 --> 02:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
channels you know it would be reviewed
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
by the insurance carrier there's a whole
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
process under the workers compensation
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
statute for um those types of reviews so
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
that determinations can get made and if
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
it's disputed there would be a right in
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
that the sense that the insurance
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
carrier said we don't either think it
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
rises to the level of a work injury or
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
we don't think there's an employee
 
02:07:43.709 --> 02:07:43.719 align:start position:0%
employer relationship um it could be
 
02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
disputed through the department at A
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing um in which again
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
that presumption would attach
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
because they're not otherwise Exempted
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
from the presumption under current
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
iteration of law if they're not if it's
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
not an employee if it has nothing to do
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
with workers compensation and workers
 
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
compensation is only going to apply
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
where you have an employee employer
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
relationship um I imagine there's other
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
recourse out there I don't know I'm not
 
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's been a bit since I've been in
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
school myself I remember there being
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
forms of health insurance I don't know
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
if that could go through health
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
insurance um I don't know what other
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
types of programs could be out there
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
whether private suit or of some sort
 
02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
would be um applicable um that would be
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
if workers compensation were not at
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
issue um if the language as proposed
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
goes into place again that will alter uh
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
the burden if an RA or dorm counselor or
 
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
whatever term we're using were to assert
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
a worker's compensation claim um they
 
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
would carry the burden of demonstrating
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
that they are indeed an employee under
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the workers compensation
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
statute such that the uh University as
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
the if determined yes employers as the
 
02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:50.599 align:start position:0%
employers uh insurance carrier would be
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
liable to take care care of that injury
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
if the determination was that they were
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
not again those other mechanisms would
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
be available Private health insurance
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
any other program that's out there
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
private suit um whatever else may be
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
available follow up clation um that that
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
I was interested in that too that was
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to be my next one um Let me let me
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
try to clarify if say for instance uh I
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
come in I'm I'm an RA and I come into a
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
situation where there's been a sexual
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
assault and the person has been injured
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
and I move them and they get further
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
injured who's liable that's a very good
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
question I honestly am not 100% sure
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
that I know the answer to that off the
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
top of my head that's almost like a a
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
almost like a responding you know I'm
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
responding providing the first aid um
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
type of thing and further injury has
 
02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
occurred and then who's liable for the
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
further injury um I don't know I'm happy
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
to try to take a look at that and get
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
back to you um but I don't know off the
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
top of my head I think that's a little
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
outside sort of labor law it's it's I
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
think it's a question somewhat outside
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
of labor
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
law because if if I'm in the in the
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
performance of my duties uh you know in
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
a regular job uh that you know my
 
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
employer would generally carry an
 
02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
insurance for that um you know that
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's and we're if we're not going to
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
have them as employees well now sure and
 
02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's just so to make sure that I
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
understand you're asking about further
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
injury to the person that you're
 
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
responding to as opposed to the person
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
who's providing the response um yeah
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question I I I would
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
have to look I honestly don't know it's
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
outside the confines of what workers
 
02:10:29.549 --> 02:10:29.559 align:start position:0%
compensation would provide for workers
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
compensation is only going to provide um
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
time out of work benefits medical
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
benefits and everything else that's
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
enumerated under that statute for
 
02:10:39.629 --> 02:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
injured employees um just like the sort
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
of what we call wage and hour laws are
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
going to provide for parameters Andor uh
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
around payment of wages and other things
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the employees but not necessarily
 
02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
folks who are outside of those
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
relationships thank you representative
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
Miss Albert for taking my question uh it
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
seemed earlier the uh Miss proventure
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
was willing to uh get rid of some of the
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
questionable parts of this bill but I
 
02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
wonder if uh section four where we're
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
changing 279 to address the minimum wage
 
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we just had that would would
 
02:11:21.549 --> 02:11:21.559 align:start position:0%
that uh answer the main question without
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh changing them from being an employee
 
02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:26.559 align:start position:0%
in general we just because we can't if
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
we can't calculate the number of hours
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
that they were actually on call and
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
ready and waiting to do their work uh to
 
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
see if their value of either their their
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
stien or their room in board equals
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
seven and the
 
02:11:42.189 --> 02:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
quarter uh if we just get rid of this
 
02:11:45.069 --> 02:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
maybe we're done and just to make so my
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
apologies just to make sure I understand
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
are you referencing the first
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
the first um section that the language
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
is proposing at RSA
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
27542 2791 2791 oh section four my
 
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
apologies I was thinking section four in
 
02:12:04.990 --> 02:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
in the statute um so my apologies do you
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
mind repeating the question one more
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
time yes what what I'm wondering is if
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
if uh everything else if we if we could
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
just wave the minimum wage requirement
 
02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
because we they find it difficult to
 
02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
manage that and they're not held uh to
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
that standard does that solve the main
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
problem and leave them as employees for
 
02:12:24.599 --> 02:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
problem and leave them as employees for
other

02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
purposes that's a very good question I
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
in effect what it would do is it would
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
alleviate um it would remove from the
 
02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
definition in RSA 279 the minimum wage
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
law Ras from Counting as employees if
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
you don't amend it in other areas um
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
you're going one from a very technical
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint there are already a variety
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
of different definitions of employee
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
across labor sta statutes um and then
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
outside of of the department of labor
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
labor statutes labor statutes as a whole
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
um so you would now have another
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
iteration to to throw into the mix um I
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
think we would have to look at or really
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
contemplate whether or not removing the
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
definition under 2791 would have
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
interplay with RSA
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
275 um in particular RSA 275 is setting
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
the some of the tone about notification
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
about rates of pay and sort of other
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
employee um protections it's ctive
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um so to remove it from one
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
I think we would have to sort of
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
contemplate could there be a an outcome
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
that was unanticipated from doing it in
 
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
one one of those areas and not the
 
02:13:33.549 --> 02:13:33.559 align:start position:0%
other right we certainly don't want
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences but we just we
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
do want to fix this
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
problem doing it without undoing them as
 
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
employees right thank you um I want to
 
02:13:47.229 --> 02:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
since I think we've hit every other
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
section uh representative Sullivan asked
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
earlier under
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
27536 where it's under discrimination in
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
the workplace do you have an idea of
 
02:13:58.589 --> 02:13:58.599 align:start position:0%
what the impact of changing the
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
definition in that section might be as
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
um as currently written in the current
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
um proposed language I mean by amending
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
the definition at RSA
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
27536 it means uh that raas and dorm
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
counselors would not count as employees
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the specified
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
discriminatory sections um
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
36 and 3 seven if I'm I'm doing this
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
from memory so forgive me if I'm a
 
02:14:27.069 --> 02:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
little off um are in particular uh about
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
prohibitions and uh rights that attached
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
to employers who violate that
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
prohibition on uh discrepancy and pay so
 
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
no no discriminating between um like
 
02:14:37.709 --> 02:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
jobs across genders and so it would
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
remove it would remove that uh
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
requirement from the from the dep it
 
02:14:45.629 --> 02:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
would remove that raas and dorm
 
02:14:47.470 --> 02:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
counselors from Counting as employees
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of those stated
 
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
sections so they would no longer apply
 
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh represent Broody
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I could I just add that the
 
02:15:01.549 --> 02:15:01.559 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that that section
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
in 275 is separate and apart from uh
 
02:15:07.549 --> 02:15:07.559 align:start position:0%
354a which is the Civil Rights Act that
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
practices thank you represent proced um
 
02:15:18.189 --> 02:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
if you spoke I was going to ask you what
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
your name is again because I missed it
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
at the beginning all right it's John
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
garrian with a g g a r r i g a n oh
 
02:15:29.229 --> 02:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
there was a card sorry but then no
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's that was what he submitted for
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
the other my apologies I didn't put both
 
02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
our names on the pink card so my
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
apologies and finally representative Bui
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
finally I know there's other are you
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman oh thanks for
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I really wasn't
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
intending on asking any but um I've
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
heard the term
 
02:15:55.709 --> 02:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
students are employees I've also heard
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
that if they get hurt it's their burden
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
to prove their
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
employees now what if they do the
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
carrier is going to say they're not
 
02:16:07.229 --> 02:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
covered under the workers comp nobody's
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
paying a premium for them as employees
 
02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
how would that be covered would that be
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
like a blanket policy like on your
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners policy if somebody's working
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
on your property and gets hurt I I don't
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
I don't honestly don't know and that's
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
why I'm asking a question yeah it's an
 
02:16:25.229 --> 02:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
excellent question um And to clarify
 
02:16:28.109 --> 02:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
under the proposed language um were it
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
to go into effect that's where the ra
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
dorm counselor um would need would carry
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
the burden of establishing that they are
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
an employee currently under current
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
iteration of Statute that presumption
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
would attach and on its face they're pre
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
presumed to be employees if determined
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
not to be an employee um I think under
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
either iteration of the statute um it
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
would not be the liability of the
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
compensation system because in order to
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
trigger that liability you've got to
 
02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
establish that employee employer
 
02:16:58.349 --> 02:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
relationship under the parameters that
 
02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
are set under 281a and then it would be
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
a question of what other mechanisms are
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
available in these types of instances
 
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
now the homeowner's policy that you're
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
referencing there is a specific
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
requirement in the workers compensation
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
statute that homeowners and renters have
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
to have aider yeah some kind of rider
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's covering injuries um that occur
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
on properties and it's it's a require
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
that' be written into all of those
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
policies no similar requirement exists
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
in the workers comp statute uh for other
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
types of scenario so again I think it
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
would be is it health insurance is it
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
some other benefit that's non-w workers
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
compensation related and maybe non-
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
labor law you know Labor Law related
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh University is carrying um is
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
there some other benefit out there that
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
could potentially pick that up okay
 
02:17:48.429 --> 02:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
there a followup so what if they are
 
02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
deemed to be employees
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
now the workers comp system is not
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
covering them because nobody's paying
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
premiums for them and the other way like
 
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
if they got hurt now there's mechanisms
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
in place to take care of them but that
 
02:18:07.469 --> 02:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that lawyer is going to say
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're not paying for that they're
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
employees the workers comp system should
 
02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
be paying that so I think something
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
should be put in some word it should be
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
put in and I I off the top of my head I
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
can't think of it but an overlapping
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
thing here and it's it could be and it
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
can't be sure and um it should be
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
addressed I sure I I completely
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
understand what you're explain mean I
 
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
think from a regulatory perspective if
 
02:18:32.349 --> 02:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
there's a determination let's say a
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
dispute came up and the determination
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
again under either iteration of language
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
current status or proposed status
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
there's a a a determination in a dispute
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
from the Department yes you meet that
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
threshold um that's either upheld by the
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board if appealed
 
02:18:48.669 --> 02:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
or whatever you know Supreme Court or
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
however far it may go but if the final
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
deter ation is yes you meet the
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
definition of employee under the workers
 
02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
compensation statute um the department
 
02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
would be looking at at the insurance
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
carers that's a claim that's a claim I
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
mean that's a claim that there would be
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility for I I understand I
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
think there would be some um maybe
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
behind the the scenes complication on
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
hey we're not charging premium based off
 
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
that from our audit audits are regulated
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
through the department of insurance so
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm I'm just a little bit burst
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
how they work so if the appeals board is
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
the bad guy here and says yes they are
 
02:19:25.150 --> 02:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
employees then there somebody's going to
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
have to pay and there's no premiums paid
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
for an employee right yeah so I
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean there's a
 
02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
something to address potentially
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
something to address thank you I don't
 
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
McKenzie the current uh workers
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
compensation system is kind of a no
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
fault system that you come into this
 
02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
system that you are determined to be an
 
02:19:53.469 --> 02:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
employee in the benefit system so is it
 
02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
it it's is it your testimony that they
 
02:19:58.990 --> 02:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
would be taken out of this kind of no
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
fault system and be put in some some
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
place where the burden now shifts to the
 
02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
employee so you got an
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
RA that is maxed out gets hurt and now
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's their burden to prove that they
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
were actually employes that's that's
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
what your testimony is that is correct
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's our understanding of the language
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
as currently written so when we look at
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
the I think it's Section Five Section
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
Five of the proposed language it's
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
starting um at RSA 281
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
a26 I'm bad at Roman Neals uh B1 and
 
02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
then it's talking about um it starts
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
with subject to the preceding paragraph
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
So the preceding paragraph is what sets
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
the tone for what makes an employee You'
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
got to have an implied oral or written
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
contract for hire and then you go down
 
02:20:50.110 --> 02:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
to the section that they're amending
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
which says um you know except for the
 
02:20:53.550 --> 02:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
following individuals which now that I
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me it's um real
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
estate brokers or agents or real estate
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
appraisers persons providing Services as
 
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
part of a residential placement for
 
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental acquired
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
or emotional disabilities um who perform
 
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
services for pay for an employer and now
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
they're adding raas and dorm counselors
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
um who perform services for pay as an
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
for an employer is presumed to be an
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
employee so what that section would in
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
effect be doing is saying all
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
individuals are presumed to be employees
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
except for our direct sellers our
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
specified you know real estate
 
02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
individuals our our residential
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
placement providers for folks with
 
02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
specified disabilities and Ras and dorm
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
counsel so it would place the burden on
 
02:21:36.990 --> 02:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
those individuals to prove that they are
 
02:21:38.349 --> 02:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
that they are indeed employees if a
 
02:21:38.359 --> 02:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
that they are indeed employees if a
dispute

02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
arose uh if in fact the uh the system
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
says that they are it's determined
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
employees is the remedy uh does that
 
02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:51.070 align:start position:0%
employees is the remedy uh does that
relieve

02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
relieve
 
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.550 align:start position:0%
relieve
the

02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
um employer of that protection that they
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
currently have under the workers
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
compensation system where they cannot be
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
sued that's an excellent excellent
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
question and it's a little bit of a
 
02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
nuanced one um I think it would really
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
depend on a lot of on a couple of
 
02:22:12.429 --> 02:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
different factors it is a workers
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
compensation is a no fault system the
 
02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
idea being that the workers compensation
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
system is there um to provide benefits
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
in in Bonafide um you know compensable
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
injur injury scenarios um and then
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
prevents employees from suing the
 
02:22:33.070 --> 02:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
employer for tort or negligence or
 
02:22:35.230 --> 02:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
anything else of that nature um that's
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
set forth at Section 8 whether or not
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
Section 8 applies can sometimes be a
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated analysis you're
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
looking at whether or not you know the
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
injur the the claimed injurious event
 
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
and what you're trying to sue for are
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
are arising out of the same thing so it
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
it honestly could depend
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
um potentially um but it would be very
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
fact specific so it's it's uh obscure
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
enough that that we can't say we can't
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
say in this committee you can't say that
 
02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
we are I don't want to put words in your
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
mouth but that that that would not be
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
the issue that would not be the
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
situation where people could be
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
employees could be exposing themselves
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
potentially they possibly could be I
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it would depend on this on each
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
individual scenario final question Mr
 
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could um if you take
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
somebody out of the definition of employ
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
how does it affect all the other
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
sections of the law we talked earlier
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
about posters and Y and all those kinds
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
of things there a whole lot of
 
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
protections that are built in for
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
employees within the law does this lift
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
all that off of the
 
02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's also an excellent question um
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
so as far as protective legislation and
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
I'm doing it for memory but it's
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
amending the definitions at sections
 
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
four sections 36 and sections 42 I
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
believe I'll have to go back and double
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
check so I'll correct myself um perhaps
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
in writing if I'm if I'm wrong from
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
memory I believe that is all the
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
definitions of employee throughout the
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
statute so each each section of
 
02:24:02.349 --> 02:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
protective legislation has its
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
definition section that then applies to
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
that to that section so you're
 
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
referencing um specifically
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
notifications and posters U yes the
 
02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
protection wouldn't be there if the um
 
02:24:17.269 --> 02:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
language went into effect because the
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
definition of what makes an employee at
 
02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
definition of what makes an employee at
27542

02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
27542
 
02:24:23.309 --> 02:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
would be amended to not include those
 
02:24:26.429 --> 02:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
individuals as employees it does not um
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
take the responsibility away from the
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
employer as a whole from posting because
 
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
they're still going to have employees um
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know but if but the
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
protection whom it's serving they would
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
not be considered employees For Whom the
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
protection is there to serve so minimum
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
wage right the the requirements under
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
2791 um that's the only definition of
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
employee in RSA 279 which is the minimum
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
w age law they would be removed from the
 
02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
definition um of employee for those uh
 
02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
purposes um and again my understanding
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
is that somewhat the intent there um was
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
to kind of marry that up with how us do
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
is is looking at it under flsa um and
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
then there's also the workers
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
compensation piece thank you Mr chairman
 
02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
compensation piece thank you Mr chairman
representative

02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
 thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'd like to go
 
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
back to when Miss preventure was
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
testifying and we were talking about if
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um nobody accepted this position as an
 
02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
RA would they then have to go outside um
 
02:25:28.110 --> 02:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
and there was I had a question regarding
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
um imputed income if if room was
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
provided to that person do you happen to
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
have an answer to that question can you
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
restate the question for me if you don't
 
02:25:42.429 --> 02:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
mind the if they were to hire an outside
 
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
person instead of a student at the
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
school and they were required then to
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
provide this person with room
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
um would that would that um benefit of
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
having paid room be considered imputed
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
income would that be considered part of
 
02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
their compensation package I mean I
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
realize that New Hampshire doesn't have
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
an income tax but and from the federal
 
02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
government they would so would that be
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
think there are
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
certain it's a good question and I may I
 
02:26:19.469 --> 02:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
may actually follow up with you in
 
02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
writing to make certain you an accurate
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
answer because I would hate to misspeak
 
02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
on the record and then have to clarify
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
later um if they're hiring someone from
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the University system you
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a student they wouldn't be
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
subject to the exemption um which means
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
that labor you know the remain labor
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
laws would apply um as specified for New
 
02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um if living on campus was a
 
02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
contingency of
 
02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:44.750 align:start position:0%
contingency of
employment

02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to check to see whether or
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
not that would count as imputed income
 
02:26:52.349 --> 02:26:52.359 align:start position:0%
and or I don't know that I don't believe
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
it could be deducted from minimum wage
 
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
because it's not one of the specific
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
areas specified by Statute where
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
providing room or Lodge um like I think
 
02:27:02.190 --> 02:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
it's hotels and certain types restaurant
 
02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
associations there's a specific section
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
that allows a a deduction um towards
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
meeting minimum wage but universities
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
are not one of those specified employers
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so perhaps I can get you a more exact
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
answer if that's okay and follow-up in
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
writing just to make certain that I
 
02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
accurately answer your
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
question representative St
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to go back to the
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
situation that happened with pmth where
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
they provided an additional stien to Ras
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
and that put them over the line um you
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
said can you um tell me what how they
 
02:27:41.269 --> 02:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
went over the line and what was the
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
problem there sure and and that may be
 
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
another one that was a case um I'm
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with it was a little bit before
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
my time in this position so I I don't
 
02:27:51.630 --> 02:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
want to misstate EXA what happened so
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
while I'm aware of it I'm not intimately
 
02:27:56.349 --> 02:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with all of the details of it
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
um my recollection and the case was a
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
little bit ago um my recollection was
 
02:28:04.110 --> 02:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
there were one a complaint was received
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
within the department which was what in
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know instigated the inspection
 
02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
process um the in the Department's
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
involvement um there were Ras in that
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
scenario if I'm remembering correctly um
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
who there was some kind of stien um
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
issue that they were post the stien
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
covered 20 hours or something of that
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
nature um but on inspection the
 
02:28:28.190 --> 02:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
department uh had determined uh that the
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
students were working in excess of the
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
20 hours um my recollection is some 6050
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
some some hour in excess of that um and
 
02:28:42.510 --> 02:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
on you know completed inspection our
 
02:28:44.429 --> 02:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
determination was there was these were
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
employees and there was wages um that
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
that actually maybe let me get you a
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
good synopsis of that because I'm not
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
sure I'm remembering the outcome 100%
 
02:28:55.630 --> 02:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
correctly from memory but there was um
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
there were some issues there with that
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
um setup which again I understand and we
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
understand from um hearing from the
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
University system was somewhat of the
 
02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
impetus for why you know the express
 
02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
need for the language and we do
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
understand um that Express need as it
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
relates to the proposal I mean again we
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
understand what's being Exempted out uh
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
both under protective legislation
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and workers compensation if
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
the language were to go into a effect as
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
written We believe We Could regulate
 
02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
that um we would be able to you know to
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
to regulate that um but I can get you a
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
May perhaps a clear synopsis of what the
 
02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
outcome of that or what the um sort of
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
scenario was with plym because I'm not
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure I I would be comfortable doing it
 
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
from memory can I ask one followup yeah
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
um would it in in some ways it seems
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
like you know you're addressing one
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
particular incident that happened it
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
seems like this is a lot of Overkill um
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
um prevent this from happening in the
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
future by providing guidance from the
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to the university
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
system rather than upending the whole um
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
College um ra uh program in the
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
state the department is always happy to
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
provide guidance I um we try incredibly
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
hard and I think we're successful uh in
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
being available to employers employees
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
um insurance carriers medical providers
 
02:30:24.429 --> 02:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
any stakeholder who may have interaction
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
with our statutes um certainly in
 
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
whether this language goes into effect
 
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
or not if an employer to reach were to
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to us asking what's the status
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
of the law um you know can we tell them
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
specifically yes structure your business
 
02:30:41.190 --> 02:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
this way to stay in compliance I I we're
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
not we're not really able to give
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
specific guidance um sometimes it's best
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
to consult with an attorney who knows
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
your business best in order to get that
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
kind of guidance but we can always walk
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh provide technical um guidance and
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
walk employers employees through what's
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
required by statutes that they have the
 
02:31:00.190 --> 02:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge about what those stated
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
requirements are such that they can
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
craft their compliance um so I I'm not
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
certain that necessarily answers um the
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know that I know the
 
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
answer to that um but it is something
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we're available for in either
 
02:31:17.269 --> 02:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
event representative
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you um just want want to
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand what you were um
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
indicating under section two the
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the workplace um if if
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
I got the two of you accurately
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
um removing the discrimination in the
 
02:31:37.630 --> 02:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
workplace um uh
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
protection would allow um a college to
 
02:31:45.269 --> 02:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
um potentially pay men and women
 
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
different amounts is that one of the uh
 
02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
aspects I think um as attorney garrian
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
had tried to or had had very well
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
highlighted there are going to be two
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
components to discrimination that one
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
would need to bear in mind so as far as
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination Provisions that are
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
housed within the statutes overseen by
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor it would remove
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
the Department's ability to um look at a
 
02:32:16.269 --> 02:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
complaint were one to come in um from an
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
RA and say you're an employee for the
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
purposes of this discrimination section
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
relative to pay discrepancies um and
 
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
either you know make inspection findings
 
02:32:26.429 --> 02:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
or facil there's a hearing process that
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
can be related to that and facilitate
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
that hearing process because they're not
 
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
going to meet the employee employee
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
employer relationship threshold to put
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
their foot in the door how the
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statutes overseen
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
through the Human Rights Commission at
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
354a which encompasses I believe gender
 
02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination disability discrimination
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
and a host of other things I don't know
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know how this would
 
02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:50.469 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know how this would
impact

02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
those sections um just not being that
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
versed in their statutes um and I don't
 
02:32:57.070 --> 02:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
know that there would be interplay but
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
it would remove the prohibition in the
 
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
labor laws um for that type of that type
 
02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
of action because you would not have the
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
requisite relationship um to trigger it
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
bani uh is there anybody else who has a
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
goes not at all I have plenty Mr go
 
02:33:37.309 --> 02:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
ahead uh thank you Mr chairman and good
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
to see you Deputy Commissioner see you
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
as well um I have a few questions one is
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh the federal flsa defines Ras as
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
non-employees and they given employment
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
in kind would that be correct I heard um
 
02:33:56.429 --> 02:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
the first half of the question that the
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
fsla does not define raas and employees
 
02:34:00.429 --> 02:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
and their interpretation is in general
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
no employees are uh raas don't fall
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
within the category of employee I didn't
 
02:34:06.750 --> 02:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
quite hear the whole question related to
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
in kind I'm sorry it's noisy um so
 
02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
they're given employment in kind so
 
02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
definition of in kind is benefits
 
02:34:16.349 --> 02:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
outside of actual pay which is income um
 
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
the IRS looks at that as non- taxable
 
02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
income for for the purposes of defining
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
an employee an employee only has to have
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
taxable income if there's no tax if an
 
02:34:29.269 --> 02:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
Raa does not receive taxable income from
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
the University that does not define them
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
as an employee which is what the federal
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
law is done and I'm sure the IRS
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
probably weighed heavily in on that so
 
02:34:40.269 --> 02:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
have a definition of how much room in
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
board is to an to a employee employed by
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
the school would probably turn the
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
university system upside down and having
 
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes wages and everything else
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
according to those
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
benefits I'm not sure I know um to be
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
honest it's one I I may need to look at
 
02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
and try to follow up with you on um or
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps I don't know
 
02:35:04.269 --> 02:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
if I know what that means um basically
 
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
it makes them a
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer for that position because
 
02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
they're receiving St something in kind
 
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
in relations to a non-income entity
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be for some of them uh if
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
you're working a volunteer in a library
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
they might you might get to take free
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
books or if you volunteer in a hospital
 
02:35:21.389 --> 02:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
you get a percentage you get a free meal
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
free lunch for the day or something so
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
there is something in kind for offering
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
employment in kind for hours work or
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
some type of thing work um follow follow
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman um under
 
02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation do we still have
 
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
a casual employment
 
02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
provision can you define casual
 
02:35:42.190 --> 02:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
employment for me um let's say you have
 
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
a part-time employee that works once a
 
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
month that is not listed on your
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation or a volunteer
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
that happens to be in a hospital maybe
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
hurts their back moving a case or
 
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
something or something like that would
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation kick in on that
 
02:35:57.309 --> 02:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
given that they're technically a casual
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
employee so if you're talking about a
 
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer in the sense that there's not
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
some kind of implied verbal some sort of
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
contract for hire you can have an
 
02:36:07.269 --> 02:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
employee who works once a month once a
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
week but if they are falling within the
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
definition under workers compensation
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
even if it's casual work or very
 
02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
infrequent work workers compensation may
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
still be at issue if it's a true
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer um you're not cross that
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
threshold you may not have the requisite
 
02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
relationship um for the workers's
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
compensation statute to attach so follow
 
02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
so if the Ra was injured in the course
 
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
of their duties they're still considered
 
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:31.870 align:start position:0%
of their duties they're still considered
a

02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer still would still be
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
considered a volunteer and would have no
 
02:36:37.550 --> 02:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
cause to show that they're an employee
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
injured in their duties because they're
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
employee employee in kind and are you
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
asking under the proposed language I'm
 
02:36:45.389 --> 02:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
asking under our current language under
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
our current language um they would be
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
presumed to be an employee
 
02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
because the workers compensation sector
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily looking at um the
 
02:36:59.630 --> 02:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
type of payment that you're receiving
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's in kind or otherwise and
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not that employee
 
02:37:05.630 --> 02:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
employer relationship is that issue so I
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
in a in under current scenario you could
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
you could and I've not seen it but you
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
could have uh an RA who asserts a claim
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
I got hurt I tripped on stairs or
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
whatever it may have been I broke up a
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
fight I I don't know what kind of
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
injuries um AR may be subject to but
 
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
under current varation of Statute they
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
very well could put a claim forward it
 
02:37:24.150 --> 02:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
would go through the routine processes
 
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
the employer would be obligated to file
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
the first report notify their insurance
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
carrier the insurance carrier very well
 
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
may say um we don't believe that there's
 
02:37:33.309 --> 02:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
an employer employer relationship there
 
02:37:34.990 --> 02:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
we're denying the claim that would
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
trigger the dispute process that's set
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
forth under the workers compensation
 
02:37:40.590 --> 02:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
statute where the language here would
 
02:37:43.349 --> 02:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
really um takes the most effect uh the
 
02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
proposed language would take the most
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
effect is that presumption of employment
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
no longer would attach and it would be
 
02:37:52.349 --> 02:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
on the uh resident advisor to establish
 
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
that they're an employee for the
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
purposes of workers compensation
 
02:37:59.950 --> 02:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
benefits thank you last followup oh um
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
so if they are technically not an
 
02:38:04.389 --> 02:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
employee under federal law and they're
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
technically not an employee under this
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
change um and they're injured at work
 
02:38:14.070 --> 02:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
would it be a liability issue for the
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
college to have insurance in place for
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
that like a private insurer it's an
 
02:38:21.389 --> 02:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I actually would
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
defer maybe to the university system I'm
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
not that well versed in other forms of
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
liability I imagine it potentially could
 
02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
be but I would defer to them to perhaps
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
answer that um again if it's not falling
 
02:38:35.469 --> 02:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
within the realm as it relates to
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
providing for injuries if it's not going
 
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
to fall within the realm or you can't
 
02:38:43.150 --> 02:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
establish uh under either proposed
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
language or current iteration of
 
02:38:45.870 --> 02:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
language that there is that requisite
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
relationship such that workers
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
compensation is that issue um that begs
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
the question of what else may
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
potentially be there to either provide
 
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
benefits time out of work benefits
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
injury benefits Andor whether or not
 
02:38:59.790 --> 02:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
dependent upon scenario you know the
 
02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
specifics of the scenario whether or not
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
the um purported employer has any form
 
02:39:06.510 --> 02:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
of liability for whatever incident
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
occurred thank you thank you
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes but when we speak about the question
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
of volunteers there actually is um in
 
02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
the law uh because I've run into it
 
02:39:27.389 --> 02:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
doing events uh where there's a whole
 
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
section about volunteers and liability
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of things so we start
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
talking about that that's a whole
 
02:39:36.670 --> 02:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
another dimension of uh yeah are you are
 
02:39:39.309 --> 02:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
you referencing the um the firefighter
 
02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
first not which um which section there
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
was a section there was a protection put
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
in at the federal level oh at the
 
02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
federal level prot okay well no to
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
protect employees New Hampshire opted
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
out of that protect volunteers so we
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
have a separate section dealing with
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers within the law okay and I'd
 
02:40:01.469 --> 02:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
have to dig it up again but okay but I
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
we've run into a couple events done
 
02:40:08.269 --> 02:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions for the
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
Departments um we did all get one more
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh card for speaking on this bill so um
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%

herself

02:40:35.150 --> 02:40:35.160 align:start position:0%

thanks good afternoon now um my name is
 
02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
Jan schaer I uh live in Warner New
 
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm testifying um on my own
 
02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
behalf um thank you for taking my late
 
02:40:48.550 --> 02:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and it's going to be very
 
02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:49.830 align:start position:0%
testimony and it's going to be very
short

02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
short
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to call attention to um
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
the differences that the students at
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth described and the university
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
system described in how people are paid
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
so Dartmouth they get a stien but they
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
get a W2 UNH they don't um get a W2 and
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
they don't get a stipend and I I would
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
just ask the committee to really think
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
about all the different colleges and
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
universities who have raas around the
 
02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:25.399 align:start position:0%
state how do they compensate them um
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
there may well be places that do an
 
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
hourly compensation and it would be
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
really good to know that before
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding um with this type of
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
legislation um and that is the entirety
 
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
of my testimony except the students from
 
02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth asked me to apologize for
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
their leaving they had to go back to
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
work or to class but I said I would do
 
02:41:52.910 --> 02:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
that for them all right thank you very
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you um
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none and that being the
 
02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:00.110 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none and that being the
final

02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
final
 
02:42:03.429 --> 02:42:03.439 align:start position:0%

market today I'm honored to introduced
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
SB 330 FN an act relative to allowing
 
02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to work from home to count
 
02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
towards employment unemployment benefits
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility I've worked closely with the
 
02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Department of
 
02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
Employment Security to craft the
 
02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
language we bring before you today um a
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
recent study found that as of mid 2023
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
about 28% of working AED Americans spend
 
02:43:54.030 --> 02:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
their entire workday at home since the
 
02:43:55.469 --> 02:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
beginning of the Pandemic those numbers
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
have increased significantly and the
 
02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
number of people working from home
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
continues to
 
02:44:04.590 --> 02:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
rise more people are are able to find
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
work remotely and yet our state does not
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
have any flexibility or process to
 
02:44:10.990 --> 02:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
protect this large number of people as
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
they um transition from One employment
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the next s sp330
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes This Modern it and
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
accommodates the different ways that
 
02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
citizens can work by allowing um remote
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
work to to count towards continuing
 
02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility for unemployment benefits so
 
02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
the average um ter the average amount of
 
02:44:34.349 --> 02:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
time our residents are on unemployment
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
is about a 10we period during that time
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
um if they want to continue to qualify
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
they need to continue to apply for jobs
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so we want um remote positions to be
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
one of the positions that that counts as
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
a job they're applying for right now the
 
02:44:54.269 --> 02:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
statute as written provides no
 
02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the Department of
 
02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
Employment Security to make that
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
determination that it just prohibits
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
remote work from being considered so um
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that you can be supportive of
 
02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
this of this change which was s merely
 
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
give the department um the discretion to
 
02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
allow those applications to count for
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
the continued eligibility when it makes
 
02:45:19.389 --> 02:45:19.399 align:start position:0%
sense I've also you know been in
 
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Bia and New
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance on this bill
 
02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
um it passed out of the Senate without
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I would be happy to answer
 
02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
any questions that I can about it thank
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony I did
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a I have a question as I was
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
reviewing this language
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
um it makes sense to me and I have my
 
02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
own idea of what terms like reasonable
 
02:45:49.950 --> 02:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
expectation means um my my question and
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
maybe this came from the Senate review
 
02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
of it is we're placing all that on the
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
department to define the details and
 
02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:00.830 align:start position:0%
department to define the details and
rules

02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
um why not be more specific in the
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
intent so that we know that we're what
 
02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
we're passing is in sync with what we
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
mean and what the department will do
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so much for the question
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
I I welcome the Department's input on
 
02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
this but as the policy makers I think
 
02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge is that we do want
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure um those applying for
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits are seeking all
 
02:46:30.750 --> 02:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities for work and I think
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's probably something um everyone
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
involved in this issue agrees on and so
 
02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
different different folks applying for
 
02:46:39.150 --> 02:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
benefits have different situations and I
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
think there just does need to be some
 
02:46:42.750 --> 02:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
degree of discretion for the Department
 
02:46:44.590 --> 02:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
to be interacting with these applicants
 
02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
and and determining in each case that
 
02:46:48.910 --> 02:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
they are making every effort to be of
 
02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
available for
 
02:46:53.950 --> 02:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
employment thank you um other questions
 
02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:55.150 align:start position:0%
employment thank you um other questions
representative

02:46:55.150 --> 02:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
representative
McKenzie

02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
McKenzie
 
02:47:00.389 --> 02:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
than good how are you
 
02:47:02.349 --> 02:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative why why don't you put on
 
02:47:03.950 --> 02:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
your microphone
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
thanks leave it
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
Al uh so when you you list
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
home uh there are many people work
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
remotely that don't necessarily work at
 
02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
their home there is a whole new
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
environment out there where you drop in
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
grab a desk and so I just don't I just
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're not putting
 
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a position where it's just
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
H work where it's it's remote work I
 
02:47:29.590 --> 02:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
guess um and opportunities for remote
 
02:47:31.950 --> 02:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
work which could take place all over
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
many different areas it's it's a good
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
point representative um and I think that
 
02:47:42.190 --> 02:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
the idea is to capture um remote work
 
02:47:43.950 --> 02:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
I'll let the department speak to it
 
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
because um this may just correspond to
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
the way they classify it in their rules
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
and application in which case I wouldn't
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
want to deviate from it but we we share
 
02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:54.990 align:start position:0%
want to deviate from it but we we share
the

02:47:54.990 --> 02:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:58.590 --> 02:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
intent thank you thank you other
 
02:48:05.469 --> 02:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.349 --> 02:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
infon thank
 
02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
you I'm trying to figure out what your
 
02:48:13.630 --> 02:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
goal is here because obviously we need
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
people to be available MH to go back to
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
work mhm in order to stay on
 
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment we have Curves in our
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
system so if someone decides to go to
 
02:48:26.030 --> 02:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
the Caribbean for two weeks and they log
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
on to say Hey you know I'm looking for
 
02:48:32.429 --> 02:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
my employment benefits and the system
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
now knows no you are not available for
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
work you were on vacation somewhere so
 
02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
you weren't available for work so you're
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
not entitled to benefits that week so if
 
02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
someone is working at
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
home because that's what their current
 
02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
job allows them to do MH and they are to
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
lose that
 
02:48:57.309 --> 02:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
job is it your intent that they should
 
02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
be able to collect
 
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment until they find another job
 
02:49:07.389 --> 02:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
in their home to be consistent with what
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
they had before or what happens if
 
02:49:12.910 --> 02:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
another job comes up of the
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
same same type and they say no we
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
require you to be in the office five
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
days a week
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to understand what you're
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
here yes thank you chair thank you for
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
the question so the intent is not that
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
the applicant can only apply for remote
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
work positions but that the department
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to allow for remote
 
02:49:39.870 --> 02:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
applications to be considered for that
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
continuing eligibility so again the you
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
know the department would be in touch
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
with the applicant but it is the
 
02:49:48.750 --> 02:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
applicant is not permitted and wouldn't
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
be permitted under this language to only
 
02:49:52.349 --> 02:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
apply for remote positions but rather
 
02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
for those remote positions to be
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
included amongst the applications that
 
02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:56.590 align:start position:0%
included amongst the applications that
they're

02:49:56.590 --> 02:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:49:59.309 --> 02:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
making thank you that address it okay
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative alalani Noe
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
that was that was it all right any other
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:50:09.309 --> 02:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
much for your thank you so much
 
02:50:12.750 --> 02:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee and at this point I oh here it
 
02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:20.469 align:start position:0%
committee and at this point I oh here it
comes

02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
bill uh so we have the bill one of the
 
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
Bill's co-sponsors representative kahill
 
02:50:35.070 --> 02:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
speak Bill thank you Mr chair and as you
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
not that I am a co-sponsor so I did not
 
02:50:39.389 --> 02:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
feel it appropriate to ask my Senator a
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
question so but I did want to bring
 
02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
forward the point that yeah the the uh
 
02:50:48.229 --> 02:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
Department's rule is that uh you know
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hess is Curr currently not eligible if
 
02:50:52.830 --> 02:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
you are working from home and that's
 
02:50:54.429 --> 02:50:54.439 align:start position:0%
what the bill would
 
02:50:54.439 --> 02:50:56.030 align:start position:0%
what the bill would
change

02:50:56.030 --> 02:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that you know my
 
02:51:00.269 --> 02:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
daughter is working in a software
 
02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
company and her colleagues are from
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
Florida Montana they they they they
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
advertise in several States uh New
 
02:51:11.229 --> 02:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is fortunately one of them but
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
very very few people actually come into
 
02:51:15.150 --> 02:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
the office so I think if one of those
 
02:51:17.469 --> 02:51:17.479 align:start position:0%
persons was to lose it be laid off or
 
02:51:20.429 --> 02:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
lose the job or move on to another place
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment should certainly take into
 
02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
account that they might still be looking
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
for uh a work at home situation and
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
especially they may have child care as
 
02:51:32.510 --> 02:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
part of their incentive to work from
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
home and and feed that baby now and then
 
02:51:39.150 --> 02:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
um so it's certainly an option that's
 
02:51:41.150 --> 02:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
more available than it was when I was in
 
02:51:44.110 --> 02:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
the workforce and we want to encourage
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
that to happen all right thank you very
 
02:51:49.309 --> 02:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
much questions
 
02:51:51.550 --> 02:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again thank you
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
and while you were speaking I got some
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
additional cards so I would ask Joy
 
02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
Kurt um speaking in support of the bill
 
02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
forward this okay is that better yeah
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh my name is Joy Kur I am going to
 
02:52:16.590 --> 02:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
share my story I'm the one that
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
advocated to senator quac Perkins for
 
02:52:21.510 --> 02:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
this bill uh cuz I
 
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
experienced uh the adverse side of this
 
02:52:27.790 --> 02:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
bill affecting me I am a VP of
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
technology and was working for as sendal
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
which is a company based at Hampton New
 
02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is 100% remote uh they
 
02:52:36.429 --> 02:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
employee people in New Hampshire and all
 
02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
over the United States and the state of
 
02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire requires them to pay
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment for all employees including
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
myself I was laid off in October 2020 uh
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
22 and I I was actually hired my mom
 
02:52:52.910 --> 02:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
lives in San Diego and while I was
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
living in San Diego even though my
 
02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
residence is in Portsmouth and I live
 
02:52:58.590 --> 02:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
here a majority of the year and so I was
 
02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
able this is my longer version of the
 
02:53:01.790 --> 02:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
story but I think it's relevant because
 
02:53:04.110 --> 02:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
it covers a couple points so I went to
 
02:53:06.389 --> 02:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
the unemployment office uh while I was
 
02:53:08.030 --> 02:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
collecting unemployment and I used to
 
02:53:09.990 --> 02:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
work it into it which is first St of San
 
02:53:12.190 --> 02:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
Diego to meet with former colleagues to
 
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
pursue other opportunities so I went to
 
02:53:16.349 --> 02:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
the unemployment office and asked am I
 
02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to go to San Diego so just
 
02:53:19.349 --> 02:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
because someone's not in New Hampshire
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they're actively on
 
02:53:23.349 --> 02:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
vacation they might be exploring other
 
02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are remote to remain
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I was given the yes
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're able to go the day I was left uh
 
02:53:35.070 --> 02:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
a week later I got declined
 
02:53:36.670 --> 02:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment even though I had been
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
collecting for five weeks and I'll share
 
02:53:40.389 --> 02:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
this as well I also own a retail
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
business in Portsmouth New Hampshire and
 
02:53:43.389 --> 02:53:43.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit of a very unique
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
situation that I employ two to three to
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
10 people at a time and and there's
 
02:53:50.590 --> 02:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
another bill that I think needs to be
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
made which is I was informed that I
 
02:53:56.030 --> 02:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
could not collect unemployment and keep
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
this business open effectively because
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
even though I survived covid and kept
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
the business open I've been open for
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
seven years because this unemployment
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
recognize expenses like the IRS does so
 
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
if I made $100 in a winter day but my
 
02:54:15.550 --> 02:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
employee expenses are 150 I have to
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
report $100 of income on my un
 
02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
employment so that put me in a position
 
02:54:22.510 --> 02:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
that I ended up having to lay off all my
 
02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
staff in January of 2022 so I did that
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
go to California to expand my
 
02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the first time I had to
 
02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
lay people off in spite of Co and
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
keeping everybody employed and then I
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
get declined you call unemployment they
 
02:54:37.309 --> 02:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
told me it was because of the law so I
 
02:54:39.229 --> 02:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
presumed it was because I was in
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
California and appealed it it takes
 
02:54:43.950 --> 02:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
about seven weeks to get an
 
02:54:46.110 --> 02:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
appeal uh and also I'll share this when
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
you go through Unemployment you have to
 
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
fill out a questionnaire every week
 
02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's about 20 questions there is
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
nothing about applying for remote work
 
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
as disqualifying you they require you
 
02:54:58.269 --> 02:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
for you to apply for five jobs there's
 
02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
nothing saying is one of those jobs or
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
all of those jobs B said in New
 
02:55:04.269 --> 02:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it's here's the five jobs
 
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
and I was logging those I also
 
02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
previously was exploring an opportunity
 
02:55:11.309 --> 02:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
in Boston but in this period of time the
 
02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
jobs I applied for is remote I work in
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
Tech almost a m it's shifting a little
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
bit now but in 2022 23 still a
 
02:55:21.710 --> 02:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
significant amount of opportunities are
 
02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
remote at this point from Co and the
 
02:55:27.030 --> 02:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
workforce shifting so it took seven
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
weeks to get an appeal to find out why I
 
02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
was being declined I've now closed my
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
business I accelerated it and finally
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
five weeks later I end up on the appeal
 
02:55:39.429 --> 02:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're answering and I was
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
speaking in the context of I'm applying
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
for remote work I'm in California
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
thinking I was being decent because I
 
02:55:47.710 --> 02:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
was in California and networking there
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
and applying for for jobs and in the
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
middle of the hearing I got informed it
 
02:55:55.229 --> 02:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
was because I wasn't available for work
 
02:55:56.830 --> 02:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
outside of my home by applying for work
 
02:55:58.229 --> 02:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
it actually had nothing to do with being
 
02:55:59.550 --> 02:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
in California this was the first time I
 
02:56:02.429 --> 02:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
find out about this five weeks after um
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I got declined for five weeks of
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment in spite of laying off all
 
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
my employees so this is why I've
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
advocated for this bill uh I'll also
 
02:56:12.269 --> 02:56:12.279 align:start position:0%
share that technically I own a
 
02:56:14.229 --> 02:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
commercial property I live upstairs on
 
02:56:17.550 --> 02:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
the second floor my first floor by law
 
02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:19.110 align:start position:0%
the second floor my first floor by law
and

02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
um zoning in Portsmouth must be retail
 
02:56:24.030 --> 02:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
and I have an office in there and yet I
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
was considered working from home because
 
02:56:27.150 --> 02:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
I have the same business address as my
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
upstairs address so I'll also just share
 
02:56:34.110 --> 02:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
my opinion on this um the other thing to
 
02:56:36.990 --> 02:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
consider besides the fact oh I'm now or
 
02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually currently offered a role it's
 
02:56:41.469 --> 02:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
100% remote based out of California out
 
02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
of San CL out of my network so I think
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
this law is incredibly Antiquated and we
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
also need to to recognize that when
 
02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
people are expanding their job search
 
02:56:55.349 --> 02:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
that that opens them up to more
 
02:56:57.469 --> 02:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities versus saying the only
 
02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
option I have is liy mutual which I
 
02:57:01.630 --> 02:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
applied for a job in my time that I was
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
laid off I worked there for 11 years I
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
was one of 400 applicants and the hiring
 
02:57:09.229 --> 02:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
manager had to pull my name out of the
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
bin because 400 people including people
 
02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire can now apply for
 
02:57:16.590 --> 02:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
jobs at liing Mutual elector and so
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
people outside of New Hampshire are now
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
competing for jobs that they don't have
 
02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
to drive down the street like I used to
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
do two miles away from my home so we're
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
actually limiting people's ability to
 
02:57:31.150 --> 02:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
find work and collect unemployment which
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
I've lived in New Hampshire since I was
 
02:57:35.309 --> 02:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
5 years old was incredibly disappointing
 
02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
to me as someone that felt like my
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
company paid into it I'm an employer I
 
02:57:42.469 --> 02:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
play into unemployment there's this
 
02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
perception of if you're expanding your
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
work you're just trying to like kick
 
02:57:47.309 --> 02:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
back and drink a capan of clot in the
 
02:57:50.590 --> 02:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
Caribbean but it's not the situation um
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
and if we do keep this law or I mean I
 
02:57:55.229 --> 02:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
think it's I hope that it's pretty
 
02:57:58.190 --> 02:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
obvious this needs to be change but if
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
not it also needs to be clear in the
 
02:58:01.229 --> 02:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
application and actually the other thing
 
02:58:02.670 --> 02:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
I'll say is I called the unemployment
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
office many times while this was going
 
02:58:06.590 --> 02:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
on and after the fact none of the
 
02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
employees knew that this was a law so
 
02:58:10.269 --> 02:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
that's how I ended up in this appeal
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
meeting and kind of got backed into a
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
corner and got declined unemployment for
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
five weeks after I shut down my business
 
02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
to collect uny employment that is my
 
02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
story thank you thank you for listening
 
02:58:24.510 --> 02:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.750 --> 02:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
that I heard two different things I I
 
02:58:35.229 --> 02:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
need to sure understand were you denied
 
02:58:39.150 --> 02:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
yes because well could you sum could you
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
summarize why you denied because I'm
 
02:58:44.190 --> 02:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
hearing one thing about owning your own
 
02:58:48.670 --> 02:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
business MH and not being able to apply
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
versus the remote aspect of it after I
 
02:58:54.830 --> 02:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
initially was declined and what was the
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
initial decline for for having a
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
business you can't collect unemployment
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
be self-employed I don't I'm not a W2 my
 
02:59:03.469 --> 02:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
employee is not my livelihood it's a
 
02:59:05.469 --> 02:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
hobby business there is a provision that
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
you can have a hobby business and still
 
02:59:08.790 --> 02:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
collect unemployment my livelihood I
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
cannot live off of the business it is
 
02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
not um part of why I keep employees on
 
02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
in the winter I am literally in that
 
02:59:17.309 --> 02:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
example you know Portsmouth it's the
 
02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
street with the tug boats it's like a
 
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
wind tunnel I don't like to lose my
 
02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
employees I lost one of my best
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
employees in this matter um but I keep
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
them on and some days on blizzard days
 
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
pay their employee wages out of my own
 
02:59:33.110 --> 02:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
personal income like I probably should
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes not not be open but I do it to
 
02:59:39.229 --> 02:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
keep staff I do it to keep them employed
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
and so in that scenario so I then got um
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
after my initial decline I was approved
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
because it was recognized that this is a
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
ho this is supplemental income I think
 
02:59:54.429 --> 02:59:54.439 align:start position:0%
is what it's called um my income is my
 
02:59:54.439 --> 02:59:55.389 align:start position:0%
is what it's called um my income is my
Tech

02:59:55.389 --> 02:59:55.399 align:start position:0%
Tech
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
Career okay so that was the first right
 
02:59:59.790 --> 02:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
that's not why we're here yeah okay and
 
03:00:02.710 --> 03:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
then explain what happened on the the
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
second the second one was that I then
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
was collecting for four or five weeks or
 
03:00:11.309 --> 03:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
whatever it was maybe eight and I asked
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
if I could go to California to pursue
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
work there and I was given a yes A week
 
03:00:17.439 --> 03:00:18.630 align:start position:0%
work there and I was given a yes A week
later

03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
I got
 
03:00:23.110 --> 03:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
declined and go to California travel
 
03:00:25.710 --> 03:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
live there move there no my mom lives
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
there to pursue opportunities there my
 
03:00:30.269 --> 03:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
my address is New Hampshire I still on
 
03:00:32.269 --> 03:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
my house my cars are here I went there
 
03:00:34.269 --> 03:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
shortterm to pursue opportunities
 
03:00:35.550 --> 03:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
because I used to live and work there
 
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
for five years okay and interview there
 
03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
so and you were still pursuing
 
03:00:44.190 --> 03:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities there corre so why was
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
that declin because I found out in the
 
03:00:50.110 --> 03:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
appeal meeting that I the applications I
 
03:00:52.510 --> 03:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
submit in that period of time were for
 
03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
remote work because I work in technology
 
03:00:56.429 --> 03:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a significant amount of work
 
03:00:57.630 --> 03:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're talking about I
 
03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
found out in the appeal meeting that I
 
03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
was declined because I was applying for
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
working at home which is also a little
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
Nuance for me specifically because my
 
03:01:09.070 --> 03:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
office is in the same address as my
 
03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
business so I think I shouldn't have
 
03:01:12.229 --> 03:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
been declined at all but this raised the
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
issue of this law is Antiquated anyone
 
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
that works in technology and I'm an
 
03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
example had a completely remote job
 
03:01:20.309 --> 03:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire requires that
 
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
company to pay unemployment for me the
 
03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
2.9% or whatever it is I am now going to
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
be employed again with a fully remote
 
03:01:28.349 --> 03:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
job based out of New Hampshire I mean
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
based out of California but living in my
 
03:01:32.750 --> 03:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
exact same residence and work fully
 
03:01:35.710 --> 03:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
remote all and if I was limited to
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
applying for jobs in New Hampshire he
 
03:01:39.550 --> 03:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
would actually be detrimental to my job
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
search because 400 people are applying
 
03:01:44.349 --> 03:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
for jobs at Liberty Mutual because
 
03:01:45.550 --> 03:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
they're they're offering it to remote
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
people that used to only be remote all
 
03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the clarification
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative Vine yeah
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman just to dve
 
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
tail off of uh the Chairman's question
 
03:01:58.590 --> 03:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
um when you got the yes did you get that
 
03:02:00.190 --> 03:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
yes in writing or you just called it and
 
03:02:02.910 --> 03:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
got a blanket yes because that would
 
03:02:06.190 --> 03:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
probably be material to your appeals but
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't get to climb for that I got to
 
03:02:08.910 --> 03:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
climb because I was applying for remote
 
03:02:10.190 --> 03:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
work it had nothing to do with
 
03:02:12.269 --> 03:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
California understood thank you yeah I
 
03:02:14.910 --> 03:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
think my opin my belief about what
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
happened is the person declined me
 
03:02:17.229 --> 03:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
because I was in California and the
 
03:02:18.670 --> 03:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
person that I had the appe have had a
 
03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
different interpretation of this law and
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
why I was declined thank you but this
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
should be removed altogether because
 
03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
remote work is a common I don't know
 
03:02:28.349 --> 03:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are but a majority I
 
03:02:30.550 --> 03:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
mean every employee here work from home
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
during covid right like we all work from
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
home and can work from home and I think
 
03:02:37.710 --> 03:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
this was a law was passed I think in '
 
03:02:40.790 --> 03:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
84 87 or something there was probably a
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
time where it was perceived that if
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
you're working from home you're limiting
 
03:02:44.910 --> 03:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
your opportunities and that is not the
 
03:02:47.870 --> 03:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
current modern state of our society and
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
economy you actually are significantly
 
03:02:52.229 --> 03:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
expanding your opportunities and telling
 
03:02:53.790 --> 03:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
me to limit it to New Hampshire you're
 
03:02:56.269 --> 03:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
actually causing me to maybe limit my
 
03:02:58.349 --> 03:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities and be a New Hampshire
 
03:03:00.670 --> 03:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
resident and actually me having a job
 
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
based out of California is and keeping
 
03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
my business open is continuing the New
 
03:03:08.190 --> 03:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy and so this shouldn't
 
03:03:11.349 --> 03:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
be the situation especially when I laid
 
03:03:13.110 --> 03:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
off all my staff to collect
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment further
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
much for
 
03:03:22.150 --> 03:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
next I would call Steven Tower uh
 
03:03:23.469 --> 03:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Legal
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
Assistant speaking in support of the
 
03:03:28.550 --> 03:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:03:30.550 --> 03:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Steve Tower
 
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney at New Hampshire legal
 
03:03:34.229 --> 03:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
assistants um we represent low-income
 
03:03:36.269 --> 03:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
families and seniors and I'm am one of
 
03:03:37.950 --> 03:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
our attorneys that does a lot of our
 
03:03:41.469 --> 03:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
unemployment work um I I will say that
 
03:03:44.349 --> 03:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill addressed you
 
03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
know I've been at nhla doing
 
03:03:48.349 --> 03:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment work since 2015
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
and it it I only realized that this was
 
03:03:54.349 --> 03:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
an issue last fall I had a client last
 
03:03:58.590 --> 03:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
fall who um had worked for a company for
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
I think eight or nine years and for the
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
last four or so years she had been
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
working remotely from home and part of
 
03:04:08.229 --> 03:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
the reason that she had made that change
 
03:04:11.550 --> 03:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
was um her mother had some health issues
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
and being in the home with her mother
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
during the workday allowed her mother to
 
03:04:17.710 --> 03:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
remain at home and not in a nursing home
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
home and the employer was happy to do
 
03:04:22.190 --> 03:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
that she was eventually laid off and she
 
03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
went to apply for unemployment and was
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
denied and she applied for assistance
 
03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
with us now I don't deal with a lot of
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
people who work remotely because we
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
represent primarily low-income workers
 
03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
um but at this point she was unemployed
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
and had no income so she was low income
 
03:04:39.389 --> 03:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
and that's how she ended up in our
 
03:04:42.590 --> 03:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
office um and through the appeal process
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
I quickly discovered that there is an
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
existing section in RSA 282 a um the
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment statute that talks about um
 
03:04:55.950 --> 03:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh that an individual who is only
 
03:04:59.110 --> 03:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
available for work inside the home is uh
 
03:05:02.349 --> 03:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
ineligible for unemployment and one of
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
the questions that she was asked during
 
03:05:06.550 --> 03:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
her questionnaires for her application
 
03:05:08.550 --> 03:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
was are you available for work outside
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
the home and she had said no and she was
 
03:05:12.150 --> 03:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
denied for that purpose so I had to tell
 
03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
her unfortunately as the Law's written
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
you're not eligible for unemployment now
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
she did find another um work from home
 
03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
job about 8 weeks later that she started
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
and she's still working there um but she
 
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
was not eligible for unemployment for
 
03:05:27.389 --> 03:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
those two months that she was out of
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
work because she was looking at
 
03:05:35.229 --> 03:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
exclusively remote work jobs um and uh
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
then I saw that this bill was was
 
03:05:38.990 --> 03:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
introduced and and I wanted to to speak
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
to it a little bit um before I forget uh
 
03:05:43.630 --> 03:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie you had a
 
03:05:45.309 --> 03:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
question earlier about why it says
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
specifically home and that there are you
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
know cafes that people work from and
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
such and and I believe the reason the
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
bill is written this way is because the
 
03:05:59.070 --> 03:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
original um 282a col 39 was specifically
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
restricted eligibility for people who
 
03:06:03.070 --> 03:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
were only available to work at home and
 
03:06:06.190 --> 03:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
in the 80s I imagine that was primarily
 
03:06:08.990 --> 03:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
people who might have been doing um
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
telemarketing or peac meal working of
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
producing something in their home you
 
03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
know a fairly limited section of the
 
03:06:18.750 --> 03:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
workforce and of course not everyone in
 
03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Workforce can work from
 
03:06:22.229 --> 03:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
home restaurant workers construction
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
workers anyone that that has to go out
 
03:06:25.990 --> 03:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
and deal with the public they they're
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
not able to do that from home but there
 
03:06:31.950 --> 03:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
is a very substantial section of the
 
03:06:34.469 --> 03:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
workforce office workers that are now
 
03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
able to work from home um and this bill
 
03:06:44.110 --> 03:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
would uh allow them to uh work from home
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
and continue looking for work from home
 
03:06:48.910 --> 03:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
so long as they have a reasonable
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
expectation of finding that job now um I
 
03:06:56.309 --> 03:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to to to limit my work
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
search from home because I'm an attorney
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to go to court
 
03:07:02.070 --> 03:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to come to legislative
 
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
hearings I would not be able to find a
 
03:07:06.990 --> 03:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
job like this if I were limiting myself
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
to uh work from home so uh but there are
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
many people who are able to um both of
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
my parents who live in Massachusetts uh
 
03:07:18.469 --> 03:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
work from home my mother has worked from
 
03:07:21.670 --> 03:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
home for the last 20 years um as a
 
03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
office manager for book Manufacturing
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
Company um I recently moved up to
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
Thorton in Grafton County and I've met a
 
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
number of people who have moved up to
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
the northern Tri Counties um who are
 
03:07:38.670 --> 03:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
able to work remotely um and and they
 
03:07:41.229 --> 03:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
are now able to live in places working
 
03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
for uh larger companies that maybe don't
 
03:07:46.750 --> 03:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
have physical locations in those
 
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
counties and now
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
they are able to bring that money and
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
their families into those
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
communities um I I see this change as
 
03:07:57.070 --> 03:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
being a major benefit to New Hampshire's
 
03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
economy and
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
allowing uh New Hampshire to compete
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
with the growing remote Workforce to
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
bring that money and those employees
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
here to the state of New Hampshire um
 
03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I uh I while it does not directly
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
affect a large portion of my client base
 
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
at nhla it does affect some of them um
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I am in support of this bill and I
 
03:08:24.750 --> 03:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
was also involved in the discussions
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
with Senator Perkins quara and the the
 
03:08:30.229 --> 03:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
Bia to
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
um discuss any concerns that the Bia had
 
03:08:36.309 --> 03:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
about this bill and um I think I I I
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
hope that this committee uh uh supports
 
03:08:41.830 --> 03:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you thank you very much
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:08:49.630 --> 03:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
question do people working from home
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable expectation of
 
03:08:53.520 --> 03:08:55.030 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable expectation of
substantial

03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
03:08:57.790 --> 03:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh it depends on what type
 
03:08:59.389 --> 03:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
of work they do if they're a
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
construction worker I would say that
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're probably not going to have a
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunity of finding
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
construction work from their their home
 
03:09:12.510 --> 03:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
office um but um so that that
 
03:09:14.349 --> 03:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
calculation is going to be made by the
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
department and the department already
 
03:09:17.950 --> 03:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
makes similar calculations
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
for the work search requirement that
 
03:09:24.030 --> 03:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
already exists in
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
um if I were to become unemployed today
 
03:09:29.710 --> 03:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
I initially could be limiting my work
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
search to other attorney positions in
 
03:09:33.469 --> 03:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I wouldn't
 
03:09:35.950 --> 03:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
immediately have to apply for a fast
 
03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
food position or um um you know a
 
03:09:43.229 --> 03:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
janitorial position or or something that
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
would not make the best use of my skill
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
set um and
 
03:09:52.110 --> 03:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
as the department assesses my my skill
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
set and the availability for work with
 
03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for out there they can
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
require me to start looking outside of
 
03:10:02.670 --> 03:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
my most recent past work if my
 
03:10:06.429 --> 03:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment drags on or uh the there
 
03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
are not a substantial number of attorney
 
03:10:10.269 --> 03:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
positions available in New Hampshire at
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
the time and so the department makes
 
03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
that calculation about um the reasonable
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
expectation of of acquiring work with
 
03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
the work search as the time goes on for
 
03:10:23.349 --> 03:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks that people are are
 
03:10:23.359 --> 03:10:25.550 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks that people are are
receiving

03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
03:10:30.309 --> 03:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
Schultz no Oh I thought you had your
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
hand up representative
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
s yeah you provided an explanation for
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
why uh the work from home terminology is
 
03:10:44.590 --> 03:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
in here um do you feel that it there
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
would be benefit in rewarding this so
 
03:10:49.790 --> 03:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
that um rather than work from home the
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
remote work um uh terminology was
 
03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:55.070 align:start position:0%
remote work um uh terminology was
used

03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
used
 
03:10:57.950 --> 03:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
so and and this might be a question
 
03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
better answered by the department but as
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
I read RSA 282a col 39 um as it
 
03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
currently exists not the proposed
 
03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendment if someone were asked are you
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
available for work outside the home and
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know they were willing to work
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
remotely from a you know a shared
 
03:11:19.950 --> 03:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
workspace or something like
 
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
that I I think if they said they were
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
available for work outside the home that
 
03:11:25.870 --> 03:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
would not be a dishonest statement to
 
03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
the department and based on this section
 
03:11:30.750 --> 03:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
of the law they already would be
 
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for benefits and the department
 
03:11:36.510 --> 03:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
can correct me if I'm wrong um my client
 
03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
ran into an issue because they
 
03:11:39.630 --> 03:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
specifically said that they would be
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
doing their remote work from their home
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
and and this statute prohibits that so
 
03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
and and this statute prohibits that so
um

03:11:45.590 --> 03:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps there could be
 
03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
um language could be included to clarify
 
03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
that about remote remote work generally
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
um but um I don't I don't believe it is
 
03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
an issue that would deny people benefits
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
if they were available to work from you
 
03:12:07.550 --> 03:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
know um like a we work shared workspace
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
or something like that just uh quick
 
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
quick follow up the um if we change it
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
to remote work we might actually um
 
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
disqualify more people is that
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
accurate I we don't want to do that if
 
03:12:24.190 --> 03:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
if this amendment as proposed in this
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
bill were not adapted adopted but the
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
the language in in col 39 were to say an
 
03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
individual shall not be eligible for
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
benefits in any week during which the
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
individual is um only available for
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
remote work or or is available for
 
03:12:45.309 --> 03:12:45.319 align:start position:0%
remote work but other work as well um
 
03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
that could be a problem but I I I think
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
if the bill were adopted as it is no
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
change to the language about remote work
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
would be necessary in the bill
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
alalani thank you Mr chairman um can you
 
03:13:04.990 --> 03:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
define substantial employment
 
03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:06.590 align:start position:0%
define substantial employment
opportunities

03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
um well uh that the department defines
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
it as is often the case with agencies
 
03:13:15.990 --> 03:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
that enforce uh laws like this they will
 
03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh make an assessment based on
 
03:13:23.110 --> 03:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the number of job opportunities
 
03:13:24.750 --> 03:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
that are available in the in the state
 
03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
economy okay I I can't uh Define that
 
03:13:31.229 --> 03:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
specifically the department would be the
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
the experts on how that is assessed and
 
03:13:36.750 --> 03:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
implemented by the department and follow
 
03:13:39.309 --> 03:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
oh follow shouldn't it be defined here
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
for um ease of your
 
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
job um well if if I were working with a
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
client who were denied under this
 
03:13:51.070 --> 03:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
provision on the basis that the
 
03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
department took the position that there
 
03:13:55.710 --> 03:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
were not substantial um reasonably
 
03:13:59.070 --> 03:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
likelihood of uh substantial employment
 
03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities um at a hearing I would be
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
able to uh dispute that finding by the
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
department with the demonstration that
 
03:14:11.229 --> 03:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
the my client has found opportunities
 
03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to work and that
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
they did apply to them and uh that uh
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
there were
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
a a a substantial quantity of
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities that uh the client had a a
 
03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
likelihood of obtaining one of them um
 
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
now if there's five jobs in the state
 
03:14:33.070 --> 03:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
that they could have applied to uh I
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
think I would have a very hard time
 
03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
convincing an appeal tribunal
 
03:14:37.950 --> 03:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
chairperson that that constitutes a
 
03:14:39.389 --> 03:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable likelihood of my client
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
obtaining one of those five jobs but if
 
03:14:43.469 --> 03:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
I can show that there's hundreds of
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
remote work jobs that the client would
 
03:14:46.630 --> 03:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
have been eligible for I think it's a
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
pretty easy win for me um I I don't feel
 
03:14:53.389 --> 03:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable putting a a number
 
03:14:55.389 --> 03:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
requirement on how many jobs have to be
 
03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
out there for it to be be reasonable in
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the statute because I think the
 
03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:01.469 align:start position:0%
the statute because I think the
reasonable

03:15:01.469 --> 03:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
expectation will vary depending on the
 
03:15:07.349 --> 03:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
economic status of the state at any
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
given time um reasonable likelihood of
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
employment say in 2009 in a particular
 
03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
field might be different than today just
 
03:15:17.070 --> 03:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
based on the number of people who are
 
03:15:19.870 --> 03:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
also looking for work thank you thank
 
03:15:22.269 --> 03:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and I have one
 
03:15:29.950 --> 03:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
final card on this bill from New
 
03:15:34.110 --> 03:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security uh Karen
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
levchuk um the department is neither in
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'll start again um good afternoon I'm
 
03:15:57.189 --> 03:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
Karen lovchuk I'm general counsel for
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security um and
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
I'm here today just to answer any
 
03:16:03.189 --> 03:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and I can give a
 
03:16:05.790 --> 03:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
a very brief overview if you'd like as I
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
get started thank you um I think it
 
03:16:10.510 --> 03:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
might be helpful just to review the
 
03:16:14.349 --> 03:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
original language um because it's hard
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
to read it through the the strikeouts on
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
on the copy that's available uh for
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 um 282 a39 is entitled
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
unavailable for work and it currently
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
provides that an individual shall be
 
03:16:31.349 --> 03:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
disqualified for benefits for any week
 
03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
or weeks any part of which he is not
 
03:16:36.510 --> 03:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
available for work outside of a home
 
03:16:38.750 --> 03:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
irrespective of his reason for refusing
 
03:16:41.229 --> 03:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
to be available for work outside of a
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
home um and so the language as amended
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
would Now read it would still
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
still be entitled unavailable for work
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
but the language would Now read um an
 
03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
individual shall not be eligible for
 
03:16:57.229 --> 03:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
benefits for any week or weeks during
 
03:16:59.790 --> 03:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
any part of which the individual is not
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
available for work outside of the
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
individual's home unless work to be
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
conducted within the individual's home
 
03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
offers a reasonable expectation of
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
substantial employment opportunities
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
based upon rules adopted by the
 
03:17:17.710 --> 03:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner pursuant to 541 RSA 541a
 
03:17:22.590 --> 03:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
so um the statute is something that we
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
really hadn't seen a lot of um issues
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
come up um until more recently and most
 
03:17:30.550 --> 03:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
likely that is because during the
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was a great increase um
 
03:17:35.830 --> 03:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
in individuals engaging in remote work
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
and so for the first time the department
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
was getting more claims from people who
 
03:17:44.269 --> 03:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
were separated from remote work um and
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
potentially engaging in work searches
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
that were f focused on remote work as
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to a general work search um
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
which would include both in-person and
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
remote work
 
03:17:58.030 --> 03:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities and I believe um when
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner lers testified at
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
the Senate um hearing on this matter he
 
03:18:06.750 --> 03:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that that
 
03:18:08.670 --> 03:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
determinations on unemployment
 
03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
compensation benefits are made on a week
 
03:18:14.110 --> 03:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
by- week basis and so if someone was
 
03:18:16.429 --> 03:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
working remotely and they lost their job
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
and they applied for benefits in the
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
first week it may not be a problem they
 
03:18:22.349 --> 03:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
may have they may have originally been
 
03:18:24.189 --> 03:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
found eligible in the first week just
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
based upon the nature of their
 
03:18:28.750 --> 03:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
separation but the problem would then
 
03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
revolve around continued eligibility and
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
so the individual has to show that they
 
03:18:36.429 --> 03:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
are available for work and adequately
 
03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
participating in the labor market so in
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
other words they're not unduly
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
restricting their search for work and
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's a very important component of the
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment system um so just moving
 
03:18:50.670 --> 03:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
from there and talking more about the
 
03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:52.229 align:start position:0%
from there and talking more about the
specifics

03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
um of of our review of this bill and I
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
will be very sad if I've lost my
 
03:19:01.950 --> 03:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
notes there we go
 
03:19:05.110 --> 03:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
um so the bill has been amended by
 
03:19:06.630 --> 03:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
specifically referencing the
 
03:19:08.830 --> 03:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
individual's home as has been pointed
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
out by removing the requirement to
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
disregard the individual's reason for
 
03:19:15.150 --> 03:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
not being available to work outside a
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
home by permitting an individual who's
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
not available for work outside the
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
individual's home to be eligible for
 
03:19:23.550 --> 03:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
benefits if the work to be conducted
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
within the home offers a reasonable
 
03:19:28.110 --> 03:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
expectation of substantial employment
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the law also requires
 
03:19:32.110 --> 03:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to adopt rules
 
03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
establishing criteria for determining
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
whether work to be conducted within the
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
individual's home offers that reasonable
 
03:19:41.429 --> 03:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
expectation of substantial uh employment
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities um as we always do the
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
department reached out to the US
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to see if the law as
 
03:19:50.469 --> 03:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
amended would be in Conformity with
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements for state
 
03:19:54.510 --> 03:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment programs and those most of
 
03:19:56.349 --> 03:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
those Conformity requirements arise out
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
of this Social Security Act um and we
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
did receive feedback um substantive
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
feedback from the US Department of Labor
 
03:20:06.150 --> 03:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
um the the US Department of Labor
 
03:20:08.670 --> 03:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
informed us that the bill as written
 
03:20:11.070 --> 03:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
would not create a Conformity issue but
 
03:20:13.870 --> 03:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
that there was substantial concern about
 
03:20:16.189 --> 03:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
individuals maintaining an attachment to
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
the labor Market um and so what what the
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
US Department of Labor um outlined in a
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
letter was that New Hampshire uh can go
 
03:20:27.269 --> 03:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
did you hold for a moment did everyone
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
receive the notice from representative
 
03:20:32.510 --> 03:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh from Richard lver that she's talking
 
03:20:32.520 --> 03:20:34.469 align:start position:0%
uh from Richard lver that she's talking
about

03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:20:37.590 --> 03:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay I know should we Brian and I
 
03:20:38.830 --> 03:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
received it I thought everyone had
 
03:20:39.870 --> 03:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
received it I'll make sure everyone has
 
03:20:42.229 --> 03:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
it but go ahead okay thank you Mr chair
 
03:20:44.429 --> 03:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
um essentially there were four
 
03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
components uh to the Department's
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
concerns um what they said is that New
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will need to evaluate on
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
individual claimants on a case-by Case
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
basis whether a the claimant Works in an
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
occupation for which remote work is
 
03:21:00.670 --> 03:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
available in the labor market B has
 
03:21:02.349 --> 03:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
previously performed remote work or
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrates a current capacity to be
 
03:21:07.469 --> 03:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
able to do so um C has the necessary
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
tools and equipment to perform such work
 
03:21:11.469 --> 03:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
and the claimant must further
 
03:21:13.309 --> 03:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they are actively
 
03:21:15.870 --> 03:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
seeking such work during each week week
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
that benefits are um are claimed and
 
03:21:21.429 --> 03:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
they have also the Department of Labor
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
has has offered to be available to
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
assist the department in
 
03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
in writing rules which would then be
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
taken to the Joint Committee on um
 
03:21:32.710 --> 03:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
administrative rulem at the legislature
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh to ensure that we cover those topics
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we stay in Conformity um
 
03:21:40.030 --> 03:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
and again the general requirements for
 
03:21:42.229 --> 03:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility for unemployment benefits
 
03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
will not change as a result in the
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
change in the law an individual still
 
03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
would have to be able and available to
 
03:21:53.309 --> 03:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
work um and actively seek work um
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
and there is a component of this that
 
03:21:59.229 --> 03:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
attorney Tower referred to which is the
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
work has to be or will be suitable work
 
03:22:04.389 --> 03:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
so you don't if you're you know you're
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
not expected to take any job that comes
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
along there's a suitability aspect to it
 
03:22:11.070 --> 03:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
which would look at the Education and
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
Training of the individual commuting
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
distance and also previous work history
 
03:22:21.229 --> 03:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
so so the law as as amended um would be
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
governed by rules that would be adopted
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
by the department that would help the
 
03:22:27.469 --> 03:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
department in each individual case
 
03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether um the reasonable
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
expectation of substantial employment is
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
there in that individual case and that's
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's really all I have all right thank
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
you are there
 
03:22:42.630 --> 03:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
alalani thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
you for thank you for taking the
 
03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
you for thank you for taking the
question

03:22:46.500 --> 03:22:46.510 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:22:46.510 --> 03:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
question
[Music]

03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
um given the fact that a lot of the work
 
03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
from home people shifted out of in place
 
03:22:58.830 --> 03:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
employment um would a look back on the
 
03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
department on their previous education
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
history work history everything else so
 
03:23:06.389 --> 03:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
if they left Hospitality went into they
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
say tech support and then lost their job
 
03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
in tech support would they be forced to
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
go back to hospitality or would they be
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
able to stay within the confines of tax
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
support or some type of other work from
 
03:23:18.830 --> 03:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
home requirement instead of being forced
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
back to um an in-person
 
03:23:24.269 --> 03:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
job I don't think they would be forced
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
back to a service sector job um we could
 
03:23:28.910 --> 03:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
look at the industry we would look at
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
the industry in which the individual is
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
currently working we would look at what
 
03:23:35.309 --> 03:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
concentration of remote work was
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
available in that industry I think
 
03:23:38.469 --> 03:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's a very important part of the
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
equation I mean some Industries lend
 
03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
themselves to remote work some don't so
 
03:23:45.189 --> 03:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
that would be part of it um you know
 
03:23:47.189 --> 03:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
again some of the other issues that go
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
to suitability don't really fit this but
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
I think the department of of Labor um
 
03:23:55.309 --> 03:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
talked about whether there was any
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
previous performance of remote work
 
03:23:59.229 --> 03:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
that's not all of the that's not the
 
03:24:02.269 --> 03:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
entire test that's just part of it um
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
whether the industry lends itself to it
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
and also whether the individual has
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
necessary tools and is able to conduct
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
the work at home and that can all be um
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
that can all be uh ascertained through
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
asking the right questions when
 
03:24:18.269 --> 03:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's applying for work or applying
 
03:24:18.279 --> 03:24:19.269 align:start position:0%
somebody's applying for work or applying
for

03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you and
 
03:24:31.189 --> 03:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
that was the final card that I had on
 
03:24:35.469 --> 03:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
this um on this bill we did mention at
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
the beginning that we were establishing
 
03:24:37.359 --> 03:24:38.309 align:start position:0%
the beginning that we were establishing
a

03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for this
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
one did you have a conversation that I
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
let if you need to go I was just in a
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee testifying there were four
 
03:25:09.950 --> 03:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
people there okay I understand a lot of
 
03:25:11.830 --> 03:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
people are on vacation and you may be
 
03:25:14.269 --> 03:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
hungry or thirsty I have you have one
 
03:25:16.229 --> 03:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
bill left and we have a small exec which
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
is I think we all know where it's going
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
to go if you would like to step out and
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
go get something to drink or eat that's
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
fine okay I understand I'm sorry but uh
 
03:25:28.189 --> 03:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to keep with what
 
03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
schedule we have here so I'll close the
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on it on S sp330 thank you and
 
03:25:36.750 --> 03:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss subcommittee when you and
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
I have a chance to
 
03:25:42.429 --> 03:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
talk um the last I'm sorry is the
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
executing right after this bill this
 
03:25:46.950 --> 03:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
bill's hearing
 
03:25:52.349 --> 03:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:52.359 --> 03:25:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
1:30

03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.110 --> 03:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
um okay all right I'm opening the last
 
03:26:04.429 --> 03:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 350 calling
 
03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
Senator Susi to uh introduce the Bill
 
03:26:09.229 --> 03:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator nice seeing you thank
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:26:12.510 --> 03:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Donna Susi
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 18 the town
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
of Lichfield and five boards in the city
 
03:26:20.070 --> 03:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
of Manchester and I truly hate to come
 
03:26:21.870 --> 03:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch so I will be as
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
succinct as possible um and I certainly
 
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
take no offense if anyone needs to leave
 
03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:27.429 align:start position:0%
take no offense if anyone needs to leave
the

03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
room um Senate Bill 350 is something
 
03:26:34.030 --> 03:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
that is a continuation of a process um
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
for many years we've been studying the
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
effects of chemicals such as p in this
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislature um and this issue has become
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
particularly important in the workplace
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
for firefighters in particular um for
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters exposures um are like pasas
 
03:26:56.189 --> 03:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
on steroids because not only are they
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
experiencing conditions um when
 
03:27:00.590 --> 03:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
combating fires where they're
 
03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
encountering things that are burning and
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
emitting chemicals um but we've now come
 
03:27:08.550 --> 03:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
to the realization that the very gear
 
03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
they wear to protect themselves also
 
03:27:14.550 --> 03:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
emits chemicals um for those reasons
 
03:27:17.429 --> 03:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
this legislature um and because these
 
03:27:19.229 --> 03:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
chemicals have led to the early
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
detection of cancers uh this legislature
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
and its wisdom previously has shifted
 
03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
the burden for workers compensation
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
claims um for particular cancers so that
 
03:27:33.990 --> 03:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
no longer does the employee have to um
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
prove that it's work-related it's now
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
the burden shifted to the employer and
 
03:27:41.150 --> 03:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's the primacia presumption what
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
this bill does is to ensure that there
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
isn't a gap in the coverage of health
 
03:27:53.309 --> 03:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
insurance during a pendency of appeal
 
03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is that although
 
03:27:58.590 --> 03:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
we've shifted the burden as they said
 
03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
the detection of these cancers is
 
03:28:04.269 --> 03:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
happening at younger in younger and
 
03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
younger um firefighters so as a result
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
many of these
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
individuals do not have a lot of leave
 
03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
time because they're not afforded a lot
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
of leave time when they first start on
 
03:28:20.110 --> 03:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
the job someone could be two or three
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
years on the job and be diagnosed with a
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
significant cancer um that they then um
 
03:28:31.590 --> 03:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
file a worker's compensation claim
 
03:28:34.189 --> 03:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
for and although a lot of these claims
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
are granted in some instances they're
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
not they're not granted right away so
 
03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
what's happened in a few instances and
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
you will hear some other testimony which
 
03:28:46.229 --> 03:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
I also think will be succinct is that
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
the employer is stuck with the problem
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
of an employee who has had a cancer
 
03:28:54.670 --> 03:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed they were on the job there's a
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
presumption that it occurred on the job
 
03:28:59.229 --> 03:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
but because there isn't adequate leave
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
time if this person isn't able to work
 
03:29:05.469 --> 03:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
it means that they could lose their job
 
03:29:07.389 --> 03:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
and hence not have any coverage so what
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
the bill attempts to do is to fill in
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
that Gap during the pendency of appeal
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
now I recognize there is a cost to doing
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
that so so there are some guard rails
 
03:29:19.630 --> 03:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
that the bill attempts to attach to try
 
03:29:22.590 --> 03:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
to minimize that as much as possible um
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
one is that the period of time can't
 
03:29:28.150 --> 03:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
last more than 18 months which is like
 
03:29:29.950 --> 03:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
the period of time someone could Cobra
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
when they leave employment and it only
 
03:29:36.269 --> 03:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
would apply to single coverage so if
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
someone had a family plan the employer
 
03:29:40.150 --> 03:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
would not have to continue to cover the
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
whole family but would continue to cover
 
03:29:44.429 --> 03:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
the individual the reason for this once
 
03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
again is that if somebody is in the
 
03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
midst of of receiving treatment um it
 
03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
could be life-saving and we just don't
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
want that Gap to appear we believe the
 
03:29:57.269 --> 03:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
numbers of these cases will be very few
 
03:29:59.309 --> 03:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
as there are very few of them being
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
denied um in the population and there is
 
03:30:04.349 --> 03:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
an attorney here who is a practitioner
 
03:30:07.189 --> 03:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
specifically in workers comp for these
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be able to answer
 
03:30:11.189 --> 03:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
more questions so with that I'd conclude
 
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
my testimony and I'd be happy to take
 
03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
representative Broody thank you Mr
 
03:30:24.030 --> 03:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Senator you said
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
that it's very important not to have the
 
03:30:28.469 --> 03:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
Gap because it could be life-threatening
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
for the employer
 
03:30:32.670 --> 03:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
employee but it's not going to cover the
 
03:30:35.830 --> 03:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
family correct it could
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
be it could be harmful for the family if
 
03:30:43.469 --> 03:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
they needed it well thank you
 
03:30:45.550 --> 03:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
representative there could be obviously
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
finan cial impacts to the family but I
 
03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
think the legislation was crafted in um
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
a way to try to mitigate the cost and to
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
D to deal with the direct problem which
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
is the individual's own
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
health okay I understand to the extent I
 
03:31:08.429 --> 03:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
mean to the extent the committee wants
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
to expand it but in the Senate our
 
03:31:13.070 --> 03:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
belief was that coverage for that
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
individual and for their health care was
 
03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
what was most critical was that brought
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
up in the Senate um it was not we
 
03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
brought the bill in as a
 
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
single policy so if we put an amendment
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
on it's something they haven't seen over
 
03:31:31.150 --> 03:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:31.160 --> 03:31:35.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:31:35.550 --> 03:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.870 --> 03:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
a i no in the cost estimates there's
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
nothing listed under the cost estimates
 
03:31:49.309 --> 03:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
and what was the Senate's position on on
 
03:31:52.590 --> 03:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
that so this bill first went to the
 
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
Senate health committee where the policy
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
was considered it was then referred to
 
03:32:00.189 --> 03:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
the finance committee um and the belief
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
is that these cases are
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
few um they're rare so we do not know
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
the number but we believe that the
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
impact would be minimal um so it passed
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
the finance committee unanimously and
 
03:32:17.070 --> 03:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
then was unanimous ly passed on a Voice
 
03:32:19.590 --> 03:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
vote by the Senate further quick
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman uh were there any
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
objections filed by minicipal
 
03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
association or any other organizations
 
03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
Rel to this they did not okay thank you
 
03:32:32.189 --> 03:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you're welcome I
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
have two uh questions for you Senator
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
first um I know we've only had the law
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
in place for two years or so so at this
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
point we have had no cases that are at
 
03:32:46.110 --> 03:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
appeal the best of your knowledge you
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
know I I can't answer that directly Mr
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
chair I believe we have but I I believe
 
03:32:54.990 --> 03:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
that they will um the testimony
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
following mine um testifiers would be
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question okay and
 
03:33:02.670 --> 03:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
secondly um lines 11 through 13 you talk
 
03:33:04.830 --> 03:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
about uh if if the employee is is
 
03:33:08.030 --> 03:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
eligible employment for period of uh
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
benefits for 20-year period beginning
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the separation I I
 
03:33:15.870 --> 03:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
question why you use that um I would
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
think someone who's let's say
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
55 um you know at 67 or whatever you
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
know Medicare would come in um so that
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
might be too much there on the other
 
03:33:30.630 --> 03:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
hand if someone has this happened at 30
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
20 years isn't going to be enough
 
03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
because they're still at 50 and they're
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
still not to Medicare age was there any
 
03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
thought um to tying anything to benefits
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
Medicare so um no there wasn't any
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding Medicare um I would
 
03:33:52.469 --> 03:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
point so the section in the statute
 
03:33:57.189 --> 03:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with heart lung or cancer is RSA
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
281a colon
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
17 and in that we do deal with retired
 
03:34:08.349 --> 03:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
firefighters at uh Roman
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
2 number a number two B so retired
 
03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
fighter fighters who have been retired
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
between 6 and 20 years who guarantees
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
that he or she has lived a tobacc free
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and who's receiving a pension
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
shall be eligible for medical payments
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
only under this section so that's where
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
it comes from it's part of the existing
 
03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
statute and that's why it was carried
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward in this piece understood thank
 
03:34:36.269 --> 03:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the senator
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
for Senator
 
03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
solivan I guess some little bit confused
 
03:34:44.070 --> 03:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
that you know it says that the employee
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
shall be eligible for this benefit
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
starting at the beginning of his or her
 
03:34:50.269 --> 03:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
employment in for a period of 20 years
 
03:34:52.590 --> 03:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
from the effective date of Separation
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
but this benefit is um extending
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
employer-based health insurance if the
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
person has U left
 
03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
employment 5 10 15 20 years
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
ago they they wouldn't still be getting
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.469 --> 03:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
insurance right wouldn't be getting the
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
employer-based health insurance but they
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
still could have a claim under the
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
statute so what what this is dealing
 
03:35:27.630 --> 03:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
with is the gap so I would argue that
 
03:35:31.950 --> 03:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
someone who is retired wouldn't have
 
03:35:34.830 --> 03:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily have that Gap it is possible
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
but um would probably be covered at that
 
03:35:41.670 --> 03:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
point by either Medicare or their
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefit that they would
 
03:35:47.150 --> 03:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
have received upon retirement
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
so this might not really apply but it
 
03:35:51.550 --> 03:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't do any harm either I don't
 
03:35:57.309 --> 03:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative you know further
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
03:36:00.359 --> 03:36:01.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
Mr

03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:21.429 --> 03:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chair and members
 
03:36:23.309 --> 03:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
is Jeremy llant and I'm a lieutenant
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
with the Keen fire department having
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
served my community for the last 15
 
03:36:31.710 --> 03:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
years I stand before you today to
 
03:36:34.189 --> 03:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
strongly advocate for Senate Bill 350
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
which seeks to bridge a critical Gap in
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
health insurance coverage for emergency
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
response and Public Safety workers
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
facing a prima face or presumptive
 
03:36:45.790 --> 03:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
conditions every day firefighters across
 
03:36:47.790 --> 03:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
State put their lives on the line to
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
protect our communities recognizing the
 
03:36:52.110 --> 03:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
inherent risks New Hampshire law
 
03:36:54.750 --> 03:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
provides a prima face or presumptive
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
coverage for us however there remains a
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
significant Gap currently if a
 
03:37:01.590 --> 03:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
firefighter is undergoing medical
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and then loses their job due
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
to the injury or illness and their
 
03:37:08.349 --> 03:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
workers's compensation claim was denied
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
they face a precarious situation lacking
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance during a critical time
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
as a veteran firefighter I have used my
 
03:37:18.349 --> 03:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
sick leave for various reasons including
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
covid-19 work rated injuries to my foot
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
and shoulder and family emergencies
 
03:37:25.150 --> 03:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
specifically the premature birth of my
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
son I currently have about 12 weeks of
 
03:37:28.990 --> 03:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
sick leave
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
accured but what happens if I or any
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
firefighter face a serious health issue
 
03:37:36.429 --> 03:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
and our compensation claim is denied
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
this is not a hypothetical situation it
 
03:37:40.750 --> 03:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
is a reality we live with every day we
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
are then forced to exhaust our sick and
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
vacation leave and once that's depleted
 
03:37:47.189 --> 03:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
the Family and Medical Leave Act only
 
03:37:49.710 --> 03:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
protects our employment for 12 weeks
 
03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
after that we are left without income
 
03:37:54.269 --> 03:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
and critically without health
 
03:37:56.189 --> 03:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
insurance what does this difference in
 
03:37:59.189 --> 03:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
coverage look like for a family uh few
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I spoke with a colleague who
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
was just diagnosed with stage four
 
03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer one medication needed
 
03:38:08.110 --> 03:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
for one month to treat his cancer is
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
$113,000 luckily with his health
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
insurance he's only responsible for a
 
03:38:12.359 --> 03:38:13.630 align:start position:0%
insurance he's only responsible for a
$40

03:38:13.630 --> 03:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
$40
 
03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
co-pay consider some other potential but
 
03:38:18.429 --> 03:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
very realistic scenarios a newly hired
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
conquered firefighter paramedic on their
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
first day responds to an active shooter
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
incident the trauma experienced physical
 
03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
emotional psychological is immense it
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
may take time to rehabilitate after such
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
an event if this firefighter's
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
compensation claim is denied they may
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
face not just the daunting recovery but
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
also the loss of health insurance with
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
no acude sick or vacation leave to fall
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
back on similarly a few years ago a
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester firefighter suffered a
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest while fighting a fire
 
03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
situations like these underscore the
 
03:38:51.150 --> 03:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
unpredictability and IM immediacy of the
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
risk we
 
03:38:55.030 --> 03:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
Face Senate Bill 350 directly addresses
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
these situations it ensures that while a
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claim is under
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
appeal for a presumptive injury the
 
03:39:02.429 --> 03:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
affected emergency respond retains their
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
single person HealthCare coverage this
 
03:39:06.670 --> 03:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
bill isn't just about sustained income
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
it's about ensuring that during the most
 
03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable times our firefighters aren't
 
03:39:12.429 --> 03:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
burdened with the added stress of having
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
to pay for their immediate Medical
 
03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
to pay for their immediate Medical
Treatments

03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
Treatments
 
03:39:17.950 --> 03:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
no firefighter should face The Haunting
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of standing at the brink of
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment with their sole option
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
being to pay out of pocket for their
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
next mental health session cardiac
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation or cancer treatment all
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
while their workers compensation claim
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
for a presumptive condition is pening
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
appeal in conclusion I urge you esteemed
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to support
 
03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 350 this bill is not just a
 
03:39:41.790 --> 03:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it's a safety net
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
for those who dedicate their lives to
 
03:39:45.630 --> 03:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
serving and protecting our communities I
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
cannot stress enough the peace of mind
 
03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
and security this bill will provide our
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
emergency responders thank you for your
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
time and consideration and I'm happy to
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bui thank you Mr chairman
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for your testimony and
 
03:40:04.830 --> 03:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question do you know what
 
03:40:08.550 --> 03:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
the average Premium cost would be for a
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
family instead of a single person no sir
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
I do not have that
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
information follow
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
um would you mind sharing what your
 
03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:20.070 align:start position:0%
um would you mind sharing what your
premium

03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
premium
 
03:40:22.750 --> 03:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
is you don't have I mean that's personal
 
03:40:25.189 --> 03:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
but just to give us an idea of what it's
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to cost for extra few
 
03:40:31.150 --> 03:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
months um I I don't I don't know enough
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
about the I guess that difference to
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
really uh understand so using my my
 
03:40:38.429 --> 03:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
colleague's example right that what I
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
what I am aware of is that difference in
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
cost between paying out of pocket versus
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
a a co-pay um so and then within each
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
really I guess across the state too
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's that difference of what is
 
03:40:50.830 --> 03:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
employer versus employee cost which is
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
negotiated um at least for us so thank
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions for
 
03:40:56.040 --> 03:40:57.030 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions for
the

03:40:57.030 --> 03:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:06.670 --> 03:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so the uh the amount of time it
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
takes to get through the process in New
 
03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the unemploy the workers
 
03:41:10.399 --> 03:41:11.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the unemploy the workers
compensation

03:41:11.950 --> 03:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
process um are you familiar that
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
is dramatically reduced in comparison to
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
other states so if you're looking at the
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
potential cost for this over a period of
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
time realize that New Hampshire can get
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
through the process of appeals uh much
 
03:41:31.870 --> 03:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
quicker than Massachusetts or other
 
03:41:34.429 --> 03:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
states around the country so that would
 
03:41:38.670 --> 03:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
limit the responsibility and the cost as
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
well uh would you believe would you
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
believe go thank you uh I I would would
 
03:41:48.590 --> 03:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
believe and the language as uh Senator
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
sus uh explained that those guard rails
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that have been placed on the 18 months
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
um certainly are there to also uh limit
 
03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
those costs uh what's uh that 12we Mark
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
though was important and that there's no
 
03:42:03.550 --> 03:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
more job guarantee after that if you're
 
03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
out of leave and I've seen firsthand um
 
03:42:08.349 --> 03:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
people that are struggling uh with what
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to do when they run out of
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
sick sick or vacation time and how
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay for their
 
03:42:16.510 --> 03:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
payments thank you than
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr
 
03:42:35.229 --> 03:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.110 --> 03:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon chairman infantine
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
and The Honorable members of the
 
03:42:41.229 --> 03:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
mallister I'm a 25 year member of the
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
National Fire Department and I currently
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
serve as a secretary treasur for the
 
03:42:48.990 --> 03:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
professional firef of New Hampshire I'm
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in full support of
 
03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
03:42:56.429 --> 03:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
350 one of the things that um I think
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
has been missed in this conversation
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
today is that when a me when a member of
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
the fire service files a claim for
 
03:43:04.149 --> 03:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
workman's comp it is typically denied
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
because they have the responsibility
 
03:43:07.750 --> 03:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the employer has a responsibility
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
to act on that claim within 21 days so
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that some of these
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
significant uh health issues that are
 
03:43:17.229 --> 03:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
members are facing
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
PTSD cancer Heart and Lung cannot be
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosed they cannot find out whether
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
or not those are job related within
 
03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
those 21 days so they're being denied
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
therefore the member has to then go on
 
03:43:32.349 --> 03:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
their own sick vacation time as um
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
brother llant had mentioned in his
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
testimony the problem is is that they
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
run out of that time what happens then
 
03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
what happens when they run out of that
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
time and they have no more time to stay
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
at home and get better to come back to
 
03:43:44.439 --> 03:43:46.110 align:start position:0%
at home and get better to come back to
work

03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:43:47.469 --> 03:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire doesn't have
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
any laws that protect an employer from
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
being terminated in this case so
 
03:43:53.229 --> 03:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
therefore the state their their employer
 
03:43:55.710 --> 03:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
May terminate that employee and now when
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're terminated they're out of health
 
03:44:02.349 --> 03:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
health insurance Senate Bill 350 is to
 
03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
reduce that risk it it is to allow that
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
individual the 18 months that they may
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
need to while they're in the process of
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
filing appeal for their claim to cover
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and as has been mentioned
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
numerous times today
 
03:44:17.950 --> 03:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
not have to drain their savings account
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
for health insurance for what is
 
03:44:24.910 --> 03:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
possibly a jobrated
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
incident so for a lot of those facts
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here today and to support
 
03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 350 and I urge the committee
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
to do the same and I appreciate your
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
time and I'm here to answer any
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Rudy thank you
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you for your
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um you been around a while how
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
often do you see something like this
 
03:44:50.309 --> 03:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
happen do you have any idea on an
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
average a year or two years I well I
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
mean it depends on the type of claim
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
right I I see them denying claims on a
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
regular basis um as um chairman
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
infantine had mentioned earlier the
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
cancer presumptive has only been a
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
couple of years so we're now we're now
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
just seeing that kind of ramp up and
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more of those cases um
 
03:45:13.070 --> 03:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's probably about 50/50
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
split as far as whether or not they're
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:27.149 --> 03:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your question no I I
 
03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
was referring to the number of cases but
 
03:45:32.229 --> 03:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
you the number of cases I I don't have
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
that number I'm sorry thank you my
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
understanding there was one case brought
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
it was denied and we amended the law
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
afterwards because of that denial
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
because it was kind of a ineter that's
 
03:45:48.750 --> 03:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
but correct extended the age that's
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
right all right see no other questions
 
03:45:57.790 --> 03:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I have one
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:46:05.199 --> 03:46:07.830 align:start position:0%
here
Albert

03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
Albert
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
Albert I I don't have a card for you sir
 
03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
sorry it's a Danielle Albert my
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
apologies for my terrible handwriting
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought want to make sure
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
Danielle um I'm Danielle Albert I'm the
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner for the New
 
03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor um I know
 
03:46:22.189 --> 03:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's been a long afternoon so I'll be
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
incredibly brief um the department does
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
not take a position on this bill we're
 
03:46:27.389 --> 03:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
neither in support of the bill nor
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to it we would note that we have
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
reviewed the language we understand it
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
stated intent we believe we can regulate
 
03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
it as it's written um and I'm available
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
for any questions should anybody have
 
03:46:37.520 --> 03:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
for any questions should anybody have
any

03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
you recognize thank you for taking my
 
03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
question and it relates to um an injury
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
compensable injury and whether or not
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
you can be discharged from work because
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and we passed
 
03:47:12.429 --> 03:47:12.439 align:start position:0%
legislation which guarantees should
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
job I think it's a little bit of a new
 
03:47:17.510 --> 03:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
question there's not anything um
 
03:47:18.990 --> 03:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
outright specific in the workers
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
compensation statute that says employers
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
are barred from discharging employees
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
who have been injured there are certain
 
03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
instances under the comp statute uh
 
03:47:29.790 --> 03:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
where certain employer type benefits can
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
be triggered reinstatement to employment
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
temporary alternative Duty uh where an
 
03:47:35.790 --> 03:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
employee can assert said benefits but
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's a post compensability
 
03:47:39.710 --> 03:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
determination um you're not going to be
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for those benefits unless
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
unless you have a determination on on
 
03:47:44.910 --> 03:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
compensability in which an employer is
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
going to need to either take back Andor
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
provide alternative work options for an
 
03:47:52.189 --> 03:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
injured employee those would not apply
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
at the stages that are conceptualized by
 
03:47:59.950 --> 03:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
sorry just quick question I get injured
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
yep I'm going through the process yep I
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
thought that under the the provisions of
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
the current
 
03:48:13.149 --> 03:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
law I'm I'm working along I'm getting
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
better the employer can't just fire me
 
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
for work for comp that's not the case
 
03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically outlined in the
 
03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically outlined in the
workers

03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
compensation statute at 281a in do you
 
03:48:27.630 --> 03:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
know what if I'm not remembering the
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
provision can you point me towards it or
 
03:48:33.070 --> 03:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think to to take action
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
against an employee who has asserted
 
03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
their right to file a claim um you know
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a to make a very sort of a a
 
03:48:42.429 --> 03:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
basic description I'm mad at you I
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
didn't want you to file a workers's comp
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
claim I wanted you to do something else
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
might fall under the Whistleblower
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
protection statutes um that would be
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat different analysis um but I
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm and if you point me
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
towards the section if I'm not
 
03:48:57.070 --> 03:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
remembering off the top of my head I'm
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take a closer look at that
 
03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
and amend my
 
03:49:03.670 --> 03:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
answer representative seaworth thank you
 
03:49:07.149 --> 03:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um if you could help me
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
understand how the existing law Works a
 
03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
worker is injured on the job the
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
treatment is clear but there's a
 
03:49:19.429 --> 03:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
question as to whether the injury was
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
job related so there's a denial there's
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
an appeal
 
03:49:26.950 --> 03:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
process what happens in terms of workers
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
comp and that treatment in the meantime
 
03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:30.870 align:start position:0%
comp and that treatment in the meantime
right

03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
now also a very good question um and I
 
03:49:36.510 --> 03:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a a question of what options
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
are available and I believe attorney OK
 
03:49:39.870 --> 03:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
Conor is behind me he might have some
 
03:49:41.710 --> 03:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
better Insight outside of the workers
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
compensation context as to what um
 
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
options are utilized by employees in
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
these scenarios if an injured worker
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
makes a claim for injury that is you
 
03:49:54.189 --> 03:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
know there's a specific time frame
 
03:49:55.870 --> 03:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
employers are required to file the first
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
report simultaneously notify their
 
03:49:59.710 --> 03:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier that triggers a 21-day
 
03:50:02.110 --> 03:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
review period for the insurance carrier
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
to investigate and do whatever they need
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
to do to make a determination are we
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to voluntarily accept this claim
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
because we agree it meets the standard
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
of um arose out of and in the course of
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
employment or are we denying it because
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
we don't believe it rises to that level
 
03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a compensable claim they have
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
21 days in which to do that um within
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
that 21-day period they are supposed to
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to voluntarily pick
 
03:50:27.229 --> 03:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
up the claim um issue a memo of denial
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
which I think is what's contemplated
 
03:50:31.630 --> 03:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
here um so in those instances where a
 
03:50:34.030 --> 03:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
claim has been denied the Worker's
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
Compensation Insurance carrier at that
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
juncture is not on the hook so to speak
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
they're not liable for the provision of
 
03:50:42.269 --> 03:50:42.279 align:start position:0%
those medical benefits if going through
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
the appeal process employee petitions
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
for hearing hearing at the department
 
03:50:48.670 --> 03:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they're dissatisfied with the uh
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
initial hearing they take it up to the
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board or further
 
03:50:54.030 --> 03:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
whatever that trajectory may be if
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're down those appeal lines there's
 
03:50:57.870 --> 03:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
a determination of compensability then
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
there are ways to have the insurance the
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
workers comp insurance carrier go back
 
03:51:04.030 --> 03:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
and either pay those bills if they
 
03:51:05.710 --> 03:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
remain outstanding or there's some stuff
 
03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
that happens behind the scenes of a
 
03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance provider a regular
 
03:51:12.269 --> 03:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
health insurance provider um paid on the
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
paid on the bills um and and I again
 
03:51:18.149 --> 03:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's a process that I'm not well
 
03:51:19.870 --> 03:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
versed in because it's somewhat outside
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of Realm of what the department
 
03:51:23.790 --> 03:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
is regulating um so I think it kind of
 
03:51:26.910 --> 03:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
depends um I don't think that employees
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
are barred or precluded from trying to
 
03:51:30.189 --> 03:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
put it through health insurance whether
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
or not health insurance is going to take
 
03:51:32.790 --> 03:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
it if they think it's workers
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
compensation related is a different
 
03:51:37.990 --> 03:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm not sure if that
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
fully answered your question I'm happy
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
to try to clarify no that does thank you
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
very much I think you are correct they
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
do have to help insurance does have to
 
03:51:47.389 --> 03:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
accept they will then put a lean on any
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
workers's compensation claim that should
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
then subsequently be accepted and they
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
will get reimbursed from that that's
 
03:51:57.149 --> 03:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
normally the way it works and that
 
03:51:58.510 --> 03:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
process of how that reimbursement
 
03:52:00.870 --> 03:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
happens is not one the department is
 
03:52:03.389 --> 03:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
typically involved with unless some kind
 
03:52:04.990 --> 03:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
of problem arises that gets brought to
 
03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:05.870 align:start position:0%
of problem arises that gets brought to
our

03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:52:05.880 --> 03:52:08.830 align:start position:0%
our
attention

03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
attention
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
right any final questions
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
Daniel all right thank you very much
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:15.680 --> 03:52:17.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
Mr

03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
oconor Welcome to The Price is Right
 
03:52:24.149 --> 03:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everyone Mr chairman
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
this morning so my name is Jared oconor
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney with Shaheen and Gordon
 
03:52:32.590 --> 03:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here in support of the bill um
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm really here to just answer any
 
03:52:36.389 --> 03:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
questions I can um I've been practicing
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
workers compensation exclusively for
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
about 20 years it's all I do is
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
represent Injured Workers at the
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so I'm very familiar
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
with how these cases work um rather than
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
give you a long spiel I can answer um
 
03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie's question first
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is employers can and
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely do separate people from
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
employment if their claim has been
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
denied then there is no valid workers
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
comp claim just yet so the employer
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any obligations to the
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
employee other than those that exist
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
under federal law for example like under
 
03:53:10.710 --> 03:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
the FMLA if the person is injured they
 
03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
have to take leave they can take their
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
12 weeks assuming they've been there
 
03:53:15.830 --> 03:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
long enough um but after that 12we
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
period of job protection expires the
 
03:53:19.630 --> 03:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
employer can administratively terminate
 
03:53:22.349 --> 03:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
them while the claim is pending and then
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
if the claimant goes through the process
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
of litigation you have your first level
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
hearing at the department you have your
 
03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
appeal and then you win then the
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
claimant can assert the right to be
 
03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
reinstated if they're able to return to
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
work and at that point they can go back
 
03:53:37.710 --> 03:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime the answer is no um
 
03:53:39.990 --> 03:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay anything and with
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
regard to your question representative
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
seaworth as was indicated you're correct
 
03:53:48.349 --> 03:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
in that while the claim is denied in the
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
initial stages the claimant cannot
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
submit the medical bills to the comp
 
03:53:54.189 --> 03:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
carrier and expect them to be paid
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
because they've taken the position this
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
isn't related so they don't pay for
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
anything because of that the claim it in
 
03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
most cases as a practical matter can
 
03:54:04.590 --> 03:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
submit ongoing treatment bills to their
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
private health insurance carrier um
 
03:54:08.830 --> 03:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's some resistance from
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
the Private health insurance carrier
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
because the records indicate this is a
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
work-related condition and so they push
 
03:54:14.159 --> 03:54:14.950 align:start position:0%
work-related condition and so they push
back

03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
usually as a practical matter we can as
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
Council push back on the carrier and say
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
look the comp claim has been denied you
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
are responsible in the first instance
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the case we get
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
to the end of the case and we lose and
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
it's determined this is not and never
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
was work rated health insurance
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
privately should have been paying the
 
03:54:35.149 --> 03:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
whole time anyway but if you win then
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
the providers all along the way can
 
03:54:39.189 --> 03:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
resubmit those bills to the comp carrier
 
03:54:41.710 --> 03:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
and everyone gets reimbursed um which I
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
think also addresses some of the
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
questions about cost because
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
particularly for self-insured like the
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester City of Nashua for
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
workers comp if they're paying out of
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
pocket for treatment pending the outcome
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
of a workers's compensation claim should
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
the claim be deemed compensable U then
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
the workers's comp carrier well the
 
03:55:02.990 --> 03:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
carrier will reimburse any municipality
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh for anything that they've paid out of
 
03:55:08.830 --> 03:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
pocket for any medical bills um is there
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions that I can answer
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
for the committee regarding procedure or
 
03:55:17.550 --> 03:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
ground for taking my thank you for
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
question so this
 
03:55:26.910 --> 03:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill will fill in the Gap and eliminate
 
03:55:30.269 --> 03:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
these problems yes yes that's the idea
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
it'll eliminate the problems
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
CL not that this directly addresses your
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
question but more broadly the the
 
03:55:38.349 --> 03:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
universe of claimants that we're talking
 
03:55:40.149 --> 03:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
about here the class of people to whom
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
this applies is really small I mean it's
 
03:55:46.710 --> 03:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
defined as strictly the emergency
 
03:55:49.389 --> 03:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
response Public Safety workers with
 
03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
presumptive conditions and there's only
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
two presumptive statutes that we have in
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp one is for PTSD for First
 
03:55:58.349 --> 03:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
Responders generally and the other is
 
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
heart lung and cancer in firefighters
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so I want to say how many active
 
03:56:05.149 --> 03:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
firefighters are there full-time in the
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I believe the
 
03:56:08.670 --> 03:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
number is something like 3,000 or less
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
personally I like I say I only represent
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
claimant Sy the full-time my full-time
 
03:56:17.229 --> 03:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
practice it's all I do as workers comp I
 
03:56:20.429 --> 03:56:20.439 align:start position:0%
probably have currently 180 active
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
clients this bill would affect two of
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
them that I can think of off the top of
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
my head um it it's not something that
 
03:56:29.710 --> 03:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
happens very often but when it happens
 
03:56:32.590 --> 03:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
it is devastating um so that's the idea
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
is to try to address that
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
inequity I have a question I may have
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
confused myself when I was um asking
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
Senator sus a question on lines 1112 and
 
03:56:44.550 --> 03:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
13 the employee shall be aable for this
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
benefit starting at the beginning of his
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
or her employment and for a 20 a period
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
of 20 years the effective date that
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
means they can up to 20 years from the
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
date of they they they're starting their
 
03:56:57.790 --> 03:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
or excuse
 
03:57:00.349 --> 03:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
me uh 20 years from separation
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
separation they can make a claim under
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
the workers's compensation correct okay
 
03:57:07.630 --> 03:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
correct it's not saying they're getting
 
03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
the the workers compensation benefits if
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
they do survive if they they are found
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for 20 years correct yeah if
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
you've been out that long um the the
 
03:57:19.710 --> 03:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
only benefit you would be entitled to at
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
that point would be medical it wouldn't
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
be Indemnity but this this statute
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
addresses nothing has no effect on
 
03:57:27.269 --> 03:57:27.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide any additional Indemnity
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
benefits it's strictly related to the
 
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
provision of maintaining the health
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
insurance so you want to make sure that
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
if there's a separation someone retired
 
03:57:37.469 --> 03:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
at 55 years of age comes a legislator
 
03:57:39.149 --> 03:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
and um something
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
happens and he's uh hasn't been a
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:47.710 --> 03:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
this is not going to happen to this guy
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
because he's tough but you know you get
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of lung cancer or something
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
like that then it shows up then he can
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
still apply for that workers's
 
03:57:58.990 --> 03:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
compensation under this policy correct
 
03:58:00.910 --> 03:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but and under existing law too
 
03:58:02.469 --> 03:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
under existing law you can still apply
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
what this does is help provide that
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
health insurance coverage pending a
 
03:58:06.960 --> 03:58:10.229 align:start position:0%
health insurance coverage pending a
denied

03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
claim I'm confused again okay
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
was that my fault well I I don't know
 
03:58:19.630 --> 03:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
it's my fault um you said it would
 
03:58:21.630 --> 03:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
provide health insurance coverage this
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
person has been out of work or out of
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
firefighting work for 18 years who's
 
03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
going to still have employer-based
 
03:58:32.429 --> 03:58:32.439 align:start position:0%
health insurance very few people
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
although it it is my understanding and
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
actually there's some others that might
 
03:58:36.510 --> 03:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
be able to speak to this better but it
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that some
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities um do provide that when a
 
03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
retire when a firefighter goes out on a
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
accidental disability retirement like a
 
03:58:47.349 --> 03:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
work rated disability they have the
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
option of continuing to either make
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
payments on and maintain the health
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
insurance that they have with the
 
03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
employer um or it's just provided by the
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
employer in perpetuity follow up follow
 
03:59:01.469 --> 03:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
up but we're not talking about somebody
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
who went out of work on a disability
 
03:59:06.349 --> 03:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about somebody who simply
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
retired no no no if they're I'm sorry no
 
03:59:10.590 --> 03:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
if they if they go out of work on an
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
accidental disability retirement that's
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
a term of art that means have a work
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
rated disability that precludes your
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
return to employment so for example if
 
03:59:21.910 --> 03:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
you are diag if you're a 44y old
 
03:59:24.990 --> 03:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with stage four lung cancer um
 
03:59:27.269 --> 03:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
and I have a client like this uh whose
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
claim has been
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
denied uh you can be litigating the
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
workers's comp claim applying for The
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
Accidental disability retirement uh and
 
03:59:38.149 --> 03:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
then at the end of the workers comp case
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
if it's determined that this is in fact
 
03:59:42.149 --> 03:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
work-related then the retirement system
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
will also deem that as accidental and
 
03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
then qualify them for benefits going
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
follow up again yes follow
 
03:59:52.269 --> 03:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
the I'm talking about somebody who
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
simply retires okay yep has been retired
 
03:59:58.110 --> 03:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
for 18 years and suddenly develops one
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
of these um cancers that is covered um
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to fit under this
 
04:00:06.990 --> 04:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
section because that P person seems to
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
be unlikely to still have employer-based
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
health insurance I think you're right I
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
think in that circumstance that person
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't qualify for they can't maintain
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
an employer provided health benefit that
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist okay so like I said before
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't happen but does no
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative McKenzie a
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
question the current law allows an
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
employee to maintain their uh
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the uh employees health
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
insurance even after they're retired so
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
they could be retired for a number of
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
years that's the case in in that's the
 
04:00:48.750 --> 04:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
state of La actually so so there you go
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
that that's yeah that's certainly
 
04:00:53.149 --> 04:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
possible I don't qualify for Medicare
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
right avalani thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um so
 
04:01:01.309 --> 04:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
the testimony was for a current worker
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
under an appeals process for a
 
04:01:10.830 --> 04:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
claim in your in your line of work how
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
long does that usually take if there's a
 
04:01:14.670 --> 04:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth back and forth
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
back and forth is it 18 months 24 months
 
04:01:20.910 --> 04:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
could it be a number of years it it
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
ordinarily is not a number of years 18
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
months tends to be the outside um so as
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
was indicated you file the workers's
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
comp claim you report the injury or the
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
disease the condition the carrier or the
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
employer has 21 days to say yes or no
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
once they do that then the claimant has
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
18 months to request a hearing usually
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
you don't want to wait that long to do
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
so because again the clock is running no
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
money's coming in you have no health
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
insurance um so you request a hearing
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
when you do that the labor department
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
will schedule a hearing generally within
 
04:01:53.670 --> 04:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
about six weeks so it happens quickly
 
04:01:55.149 --> 04:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
it's the benefit of an administrative
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
hearing system so you have a hearing
 
04:01:58.870 --> 04:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
within six weeks you get a decision
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of that at that point
 
04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
whoever is unhappy with that initial
 
04:02:05.070 --> 04:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
decision can appeal it and then you go
 
04:02:06.830 --> 04:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
to the appeals board within the labor
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
department or The Next Step Up from the
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
labor department for your final hearing
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
that usually happens 5 to six months
 
04:02:14.189 --> 04:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
after that and then you get your final
 
04:02:16.510 --> 04:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
order so the whole process if everything
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
moves quickly takes less than a year if
 
04:02:20.830 --> 04:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
it takes a little longer and sometimes
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
in cases like these they can take a
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
little longer because cases of whether
 
04:02:26.590 --> 04:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's heart disease or cancer they take
 
04:02:28.030 --> 04:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
more time to develop the record they're
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
more complex medically so people need to
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
hire experts but even then it's
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
generally still done within less than 18
 
04:02:37.870 --> 04:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
months and I guess I should say if it
 
04:02:40.429 --> 04:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
takes longer than 18 months this statute
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
caps the benefit anyway I mean there's
 
04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
an explicit limitation that this is only
 
04:02:46.990 --> 04:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
payable for a maximum of 18 months once
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
claimed so that's the question I have
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
should it be until should it be longer
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
no should it be worded that until the
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
claim is
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicated I mean you know that's
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
entirely up to the up to the committee I
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
suppose um I would say in the for the
 
04:03:03.870 --> 04:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
most part the 18 months is enough to
 
04:03:06.510 --> 04:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
cover U while the litigation winds its
 
04:03:08.110 --> 04:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
way through the system you know you can
 
04:03:09.870 --> 04:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
imagine like anything in the law you can
 
04:03:12.510 --> 04:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
imagine unusual circumstances where
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
something gets pushed and continued and
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
bumped and then someone has an appeal to
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court and it gets remanded
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
and it takes forever but that's really
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
really unusual I mean the whole point of
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation system as we've
 
04:03:25.950 --> 04:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
designed it here in New Hampshire is
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't go through the superior
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
court process it's done administratively
 
04:03:32.189 --> 04:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Labor so that it is
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
informal fast and you get quick relief
 
04:03:37.550 --> 04:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you which is nice which is nice it
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
it really is but but I will say and I
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if I don't think I believe I
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned this but one other thing to
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
keep in mind and why this affects people
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
the way it does is that when you first
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
have the claim that's denied and you
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
request a hearing even if you get that
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
hearing quickly and you're at the labor
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
department within 6 weeks and you get a
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
decision that says yes this is related
 
04:03:58.149 --> 04:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
if the employer appeals it all that
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
first level favorable decision gives you
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
is weekly Indemnity benefits the medical
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
benefits still are not payable even when
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
you win until the case is absolutely
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
final when you end up going to appeal so
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
you can have these circumstances where
 
04:04:13.710 --> 04:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
someone's been diagnosed with cancer
 
04:04:15.189 --> 04:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
cancer heart disease whatever you have
 
04:04:17.550 --> 04:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
your hearing and are successful person
 
04:04:19.229 --> 04:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
has some money coming in now so they can
 
04:04:20.830 --> 04:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
keep the lights on but the medical
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
Provisions are not in place until the
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
case is over so this would address that
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
kind of inequity as well
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:08.359 --> 04:05:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
ind6

04:05:20.910 --> 04:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
and my my view was there's only a couple
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
of cases number one and you're probably
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
not going to get a couple every year so
 
04:05:33.149 --> 04:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
they're few and far between however if
 
04:05:36.429 --> 04:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
if this comes up and somebody's got a
 
04:05:37.389 --> 04:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
kids why deny a a child health insurance
 
04:05:42.239 --> 04:05:44.030 align:start position:0%
kids why deny a a child health insurance
benefits

04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.189 --> 04:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.870 --> 04:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
no um we we all have to come back back
 
04:06:24.670 --> 04:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
together to exec anyways we've got four
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
bills to exec it's not going to take a
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
long time whether it's three or four um
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
if we just put this off until the the
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
other ones then um uh representative Bui
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
can continue thinking on
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
it does that have to be in
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay so if we if I put an amendment on
 
04:06:51.149 --> 04:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
and we hear it again in two weeks exed
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
weeks Mr chairman is it so so the idea
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
of uh asking
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
for passage as presented is that out of
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
order at this point could I move the
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
heard the the the rule the rule is that
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
the ranking member has to agree so um
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's not up to uh any any member to make
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
the choice
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
rule there's no rush as far as I can
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.309 --> 04:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
decided um I'm fine I'm
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
fine sure go ahead we we can knock it
 
04:08:13.199 --> 04:08:14.229 align:start position:0%
fine sure go ahead we we can knock it
off

04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:08:14.239 --> 04:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
off
I'm

04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%

04:08:46.990 --> 04:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
you recognize speak to your Mo I think
 
04:08:49.710 --> 04:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
we heard some terrific testimony today I
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's an appropriate bill I
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
think it helps the veterans in the state
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I'm proud to uh to
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
move the support of this legislation in
 
04:09:12.030 --> 04:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
