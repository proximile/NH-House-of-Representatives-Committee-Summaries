00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody um I'm going to
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
reconvene the committee of conference on
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1127 uh we did call for a
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
recess on Tuesday to get some legal
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
advice and legal opinions so I guess it
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial do start with
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
that did did you did is that the
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
attorney you were speaking to in if you
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
want to come up and uh give us your your
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
opinion I'll uh I'll I'll do my best
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
um the can I have you state just your
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
name my name's uh Richard Layman I'm the
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
legal council for the Senate thank you
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
the I starting sort of working starting
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
on section
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
nine um line 27 of the draft Amendment
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
appears to create a um anomaly where New
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV would issue a license to a
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
person um and permit that person to
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
drive in New Hampshire but the same
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
person of the same immigration status
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
who obtained a license in another state
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts or anywhere else
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
would not have that recognized here so
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
um it seems like those two things don't
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
fit together uh in a way that um is
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
immediately rational the section seven
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh of the
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
amendment I think works to an extent
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
except that it excludes it excludes a
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
class of people um who are uh lawful but
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
not permanent residents like people with
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
student visas um and other non
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
non-permanent visas now I believe those
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
people could get a New Hampshire license
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to correct so you're not
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
excluding them entirely but it would it
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
would require that additional step
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
for out of state students on student
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
visas who come to New Hampshire which is
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
something that's been discussed in the
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
past anyway so I think that section
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
so that's interesting because section
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
nine with the ception of the words
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding I say 26 340a is current
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
law is it not uh but I believe it is the
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
but it works sort of hand and glove with
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
the section that's being notwithstand
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
comments um just briefly I I I think
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
that as um attorne lit has summed it up
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
it it's I I don't see this as being at
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
all workable um and certainly not at
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
this late hour to try to put in this
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
kind of an
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
amendment well if I'm not mistaken if I
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
correctly because of the change from um
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
lawful U lawfully present to lawful
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
permanent residency that creates the
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
anomaly uh that you're stating between
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
what's what we're allowing New Hampshire
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh residents to do versus out of state
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that is correct that's
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
um the the difference between lawfully
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
president and lawful permanent resident
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
category uh of Whose license will be
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
recognized it's the um
 
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
recognized it's the um
26340

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
26340
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
anybody I guess what I'd suggest is that
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
if we want
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
to um move forward with the out ofst
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
state driver's license provision which
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
we attached to
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
127 um that we vetted and think it's
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
workable that that's probably at this
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
late date the best option for all of us
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking I know that the
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
house rejected it but it
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
was uh seemed to be 176 to 174 so um I
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
but actually um compromise yes but
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
actually I was trying to make the the
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill do more uh because again like I
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
said and explained the difference
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
between lawful presence and being here
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
legally it's two different things so if
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you correct you're not going
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
to support the amendment you would like
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
to see the original language of 358 move
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and I I um I'm not there and
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
here's why you just mentioned 176
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
174 um there's a definition of insanity
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know when you keep trying to do the
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
same thing over and over and expecting
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
different results uh for I was willing
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
to take another shot bringing this to
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
the floor with an amended language
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
because I'd have some to argue that it
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
actually does something uh but I'm not
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take this back to the floor
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh with the same language it makes no
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
sense to me so that's where I'm at with
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
it I would more at this point because I
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
am not dying on the sword for this uh
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
just for the public record I did put a
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
um what I thought closed loophole for
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
even people in New Hampshire uh that
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
would have matched what what section s
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
does and I think might have removed the
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
anomaly in section 99 but that bill was
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
um indefinitely not indefinitely
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
postponed but interm studyed in the
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
Senate that would be H Bill
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
1118 um so now we are at it bits and
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
pieces of something that's going to
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish nothing so I don't know if
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
you'd like to chat for a minute but
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's my position I'll even put it to a
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh if need be because again I'm
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
not falling in the sword for this and
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not bringing it to to the house
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
twice I'll make the motion that uh the
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
house succeed to the Senate position
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
upon further Amendment and that further
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is to remove all language
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
related to Senate Bill
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
chairman we would like to respectfully
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
ask for a recess to this afternoon um
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to see if we can try to
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
reconcile that particular language that
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
you are speaking of um and we just need
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
some time to do that so is it possible
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
to to do that um because we're
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.350 align:start position:0%
 
11:30

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay I think you could come back without
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
us okay okay I I can come back without
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
I know we're all
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
busy and I did bring a draft Amendment
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
here to try to expedite things we had
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
the conversation about some of the
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
issues that we had uh in possibly
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
creating the holes at our last meeting
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
and now you're asking to come back again
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
in another two and a half
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
hours let me Jack one minute so I think
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of that would be unless
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
we have a solution you agree to that
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
will AED to the house position okay
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're that's what
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
do thank you um thank you Mr
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I understand that everybody's
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
trying to work toward Wards a a place
 
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.510 align:start position:0%
trying to work toward Wards a a place
that

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
um works but there's there's these are
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
complicated difficult issues and it's
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
really worrisome if we're going to try
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
and fix them in a in a couple of hours
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
with with all new players and it's hard
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
for me to you know hard for me to see
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
that that's a a the way to go so let me
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
let me just repeat that if we can't get
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
something everybody agrees to we're
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to AED to the house position
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
and there would which the house position
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
is the base Bill 1127 so just just to
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
again clarify there won't be new people
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
sitting here they will be in a different
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference I will be here I
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
will have the authority to to say we're
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to aced to what you want but we
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
just want to get have an opportunity um
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
to see if we can really focus in on that
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
particular section and see if we can get
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of resolution okay fair enough
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh we can take a break till 11: I'll
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
confirm that this room is available but
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
at least we'll if not I'll find a
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
different room okay um but before we do
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
go through this motion um do you know I
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
indication if whatever solution you're
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
coming up with is actually Germain to
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
358 because you know we operate under
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
some it has to be some rules we know
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that okay all right well then 11 o' and
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair alternatively planned
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
for this room if it's not it we'll post
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
it somewhere what room it's in thank you
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again we'll be on break till

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
so once once we're settled down here I
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
there good morning good morning how are
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
you good morning I'm doing well so it
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
being uh 10:00 I'm going to open the uh
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference on House Bill
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
518 and welcome everybody thanks for
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
being here thanks for okay I know um GNA
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
let uh representative groda uh start out
 
01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.670 align:start position:0%
let uh representative groda uh start out
because

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
she was uh I think chairing the
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session that dealt
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
with uh some of these issues
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
so so on the side by side thank you um
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative leus on the if we look at
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
page starting on page 39 I
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
believe um the Senate added their
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
language to house Senate Bill
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
485 and Senate Bill 485 when it came to
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
us to the Edna committee was very
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
similar to a bill that we had heard
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
earlier House Bill 8
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
1385 so when we received Senate Bill
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
485 we took out the similar language is
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
between the two bills they were both
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with the fast tracking of
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
military individuals with license for
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
licensing and the the only two issues
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
that remained on Senate Bill
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
485 were the digitally verifiable
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
licenses and excuse me the
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
um the part of the bill that addressed
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
that and this is an important part that
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
was in the Senate bill but was not in
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
the house bills and we left it in the
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
Senate bill it had to do with those
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
licenses that are the uh under the
 
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of boards that do not
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
report to
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
oplc and they should also have this fast
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
tracking mechanism and I believe the RSA
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's referred to is
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
327g um and that would we left that in
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill now I don't know I think
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
Senate bill at 485 the the the version
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we sent
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
back um was a
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
to for one reason or another I don't
 
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
remember but it didn't make it back to
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate and I don't know why I don't
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
remember I'm sorry so when you added
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
this language back in to this bill
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
because it's important you added the
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
Senate bill in its entirety as opposed
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
to the version that we had noodled out
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
the differences between the house bills
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
1385 has gone through the Senate passed
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate and it's on the way to the
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
governor's office so that language
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
already exists as a statute so we we
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if we were
 
01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:33.589 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if we were
to

01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
adopt the house amendment to Senate Bill
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
485 which really only deals with the
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
boards that are not under oplc having
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
the same FASTT tracking mechanism that's
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
advisable and then as far as the
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable licensing we took
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
that out because when when commissioner
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
goule came to speak to us in the
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee of conference I mean in our
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee he indicated that they
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the software or the mechanism
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
to do this now so it's not something
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
that we can um uh initiate but it is
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
something that they're looking
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
into um and the we had one during the
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
hearing we had one um individ ual
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
private individual testify that their
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
company could do that but we don't know
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
if that's the only company can do that
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
that can do it are there other people so
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
we chose to and they were promoting
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
their mechanism and their software so we
 
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.470 align:start position:0%
their mechanism and their software so we
didn't

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
know how we should examine that in
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
relation to the fact that we don't have
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
that software and I just add one thing
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we got testimony on then that is I
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
think um the information on Whose
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
license is already online at op on the
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
oplc site so that is readily available
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
arguably digitally but not the technical
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know digitally verifiable
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
license uh r m py thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you to letting me add in very
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
specifically uh commissioner GLE did
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
mention that there's a whole again like
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
we talked about whole transformation of
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
website access online access they are
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
making that a more uniform across all uh
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
offices and uh you know website looking
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
very similar so and access also so
 
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
that's in the process it's not ready
 
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
right now if you incorporate this it
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
would be how do you find that in the
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
weed so it's timeliness of putting that
 
01:09:51.719 --> 01:09:54.149 align:start position:0%
weed so it's timeliness of putting that
digital

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
digital
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
verification that could be something
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
that could once this
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
happens uh the
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is ready then that could
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
discussion my apologies I'm trying to
 
01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:17.350 align:start position:0%
discussion my apologies I'm trying to
find

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
my excuse me I'm looking for that
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment on my for which for um to 45
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
45 I'm looking for the amendment number
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can it's I've got it here
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
it's 1610 I've got one copy okay so if

you could just kindly show it to um this
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
was the house amendment to 4 no words
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
it's I'm sorry what was the number of
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh 1610 1610 to 48 I had
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
45 16
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
10 and that's the one the committee
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment not the four amendment that
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
was added I don't see that on oh I'm on
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
the wrong one yeah I don't see that
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment on the general
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
1610 and if anybody needs it I I printed
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
1385

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
so as I recall
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
from house our I'm I'm trying to recall
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
our hearing on how cill 485 yep which
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
was a very long time ago and I'm trying
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
to recall some of the information of it
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
would would you be opposed to Bringing
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
Mr oer up for no it's
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
fine uh Mr oser I can come over there I
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
have my I have it pulled up hang on a
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
second let me just come over
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
there uh so Mr Oar if you can come up
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
questions good morning Doug how oplc
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay if you have questions all right
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning see you again
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to go back and
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and recall here some of the testimony
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
on 485 and I don't have that in front of
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
me on the it you have um as I recall I
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
think director Courtney testified on 485
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
when we had this and we were discussing
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
the digital verified portion of that c
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
can you refresh my memory just a little
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
bit on that so I think the digitally
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
verifiable piece was a little fuzzy at
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning because as representative
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
leus has pointed out we do have a way to
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
verify lure on our website right now we
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
weren't sure if that me the definition
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh we were working with commissioner
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
goule to kind of see if this is any
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
different if this if it would require
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
other things and I think as
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative cotus said in working
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
with commissioner gulay he came out and
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
said this is going to be a long tedious
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
process it's going to cost a lot of
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
money and we're just not quite there yet
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
I think I think our expectation is that
 
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
within a few years this will probably be
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
a standard thing but now is not really
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
okay um yes Senator thank you is there
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
um is there an interest or a proposal
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
being worked on in your office to
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
propose a budget item for next year to
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
do this or to evaluate some of these
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
software options that um repres
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
resentative groa was talking about so
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
that we could move towards this kind of
 
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.629 align:start position:0%
that we could move towards this kind of
digital

01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
digital
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
verification so that's probably a
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
question better suited for director
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
Courtney um to the best of my knowledge
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
there is not okay but I can't say that
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
with 100% certainty um I also want to
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
point out that if something like this
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
were to be implemented it would probably
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
doit project not necessarily an oplc
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
project we would work with the oit but
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
it would be on them and then the
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
finances we would have to work out but
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
but it would be doit who took the lead
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
clarification represent M yeah um if you
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
could clarify like I put it
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to verify doesn't exist
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
outside of oplc is the infrastructure it
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's needed to verify
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
digitally is what the Department of it
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
is working on and with the website and
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
the software and once that is
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
ready oplc can do the digital am I
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
correct I think so but I think to answer
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
that fully I would have to speak for
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
doit which is not something I can do I
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
can say
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
um right there there are kind of two
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
pieces there's the website that we
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
maintain now where you can look up to
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
see if somebody's license if they've
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
been dis disciplined what happens
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
outside in the doit realm was a bit out
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
of my
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
perview okay so thank you so uh I mean
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason why we removed
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
the digitally verifiable licensing part
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
of it um representative grot as I recall
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh the reason your Amendment also took
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
some other pieces out was because they
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
um they were in 1385 is that correct
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's correct correct they overlapped
 
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
it's correct correct they overlapped
with

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
1385 so there were two things that were
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering now cuz I'm reviewing my
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
notes from the subcommittee work on
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
485 and the amendment itself um a
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
definition of what digitally verifiable
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
licenses is is part of the issue because
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are many ways of digitally
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
verifying things the the um the process
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
Scott Withrow is the individual that's
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
that was the that spoke at our hearing
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and his company
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
um has a process that is the ultimate in
 
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable licensing and is
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
that what we want as a state and do we
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
want to invest in that as opposed to
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
what is what are our expect what are our
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
expectations of what digitally
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
verifiable licensing is and because
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's a whole plethora of software we
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
felt that and we didn't have any of it
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
we felt that we should pull that out
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
because one we can't do it and two we
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
need to figure out what it is that and
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we and that's why I know
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
director Courtney was going to work with
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule on trying to put some
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
be some definitions on that does that is
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
that what you recall I do recall that
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I somewhat alluded to it about I I
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
use the term fuzziness that was actually
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to say it was
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
articulated better so one question is is
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
there a St
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
for what a digitally verifiable license
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
is that exists outside of New Hampshire
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
I mean because somebody for it to be
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable somebody else
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
presumably not New Hampshire is going to
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
want to make use of that but if there's
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
no standard that is generally recognize
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
what would that
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
mean that's an it question I don't
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
really have an answer for and we we
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
didn't get an answer to that uh you know
 
01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.470 align:start position:0%
didn't get an answer to that uh you know
in

01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
the in the public hearing or as far as I
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
know afterwards so
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
that was part of our concern we yeah
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
repr so Senator Pearl and and I guess
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to the Senate is your
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
concern on the 485 portion of it the
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the de verifiable I'm
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out can we a do we
 
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
agree that this subcommittee work that
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
took Senate bill that took the
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
components of House Bill
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
1385 out of Senate bill
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
485 is no long is is is we're in
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
agreement there and that digitally
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
verifiable licenses is what we're trying
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
to Noodle out here well that's I think
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
we're getting there because you had very
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
different testimony than what we had on
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
yes that be the case uh we didn't we
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have any of this discussion and
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're trying to get up to
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
speed real quickly what you're you're
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
giving us information we didn't have
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
right okay so that's why I asked also
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
how come up and sure and I guess if I
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
may ask one more question certainly so
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
are you feeling like that the house
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
version of 1385 was 1385 right 1385 yeah
 
01:19:09.629 --> 01:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
the house version of 1385 covered all of
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
the other components of Senate bille
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
485 without the digital portion I would
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
say yes so one thing we did because we
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
were working on these bills sort of in
 
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
tandem is when we finished the language
 
01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.070 align:start position:0%
tandem is when we finished the language
of

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
1385 uh director Courtney representative
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
Carol Brown and I believe
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
um Colonel
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
Perry we did a crosswalk Al together I
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
was involved behind the scenes too um we
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
did a crosswalk to make sure we weren't
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
missing anything and everyone was
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
satisfied that the components that we
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
were pulling out the one bill were
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
contained in
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
1385 that's a long-winded way of saying
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
yes I think we're satisfied outside of
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the digitally verifiable piece so the
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
only portion of 485 that isn't in is the
 
01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
only portion of 485 that isn't in is the
digitally

01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
digitally
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
verifiable yeah I I can see that written
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
we have written
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
got I see it's in here it is right here
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
in where is it
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
l this is the language but this but this
 
01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
is the language that they put in into
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
here not withstanding any general
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
special LA to the country so part
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
two so this language we could get rid of
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
this because it's this is already going
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
this I pause excuse me I would to make
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the um the wording from
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1610 is added to Senate bill
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 1079 so that we make sure
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
518 518 we're dealing with 518 518 I'm
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
so sorry I got too many numbers in my
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
apologies let me start over I would
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
recommend that the amendment 1610 which
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
talks about um these um military
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
education me yeah that's portion of it
 
01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%
is what we add to Senate bill to House
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 1518 this part is very important
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
and was in Senate Bill 485 and was not
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
in 1385 so there this one small piece
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
exactly 485 as it came out of the house
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
right with the house Amendment so the
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
remainder of 485 sorry yeah no no please
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
the remainder of
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
485 is in 1385 except for the digitally
 
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
verified abortion I'm just trying to
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
make sure I that yes exactly exactly
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
between the two between the two adding
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
this amendment covers everything and we
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
still leave digital verification on the
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
table for next year to Define and fund
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
correct that the that that's the
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
motivation here correct that's our next
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
step is to figure out how to digitally
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
verify and move this and and close the
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
circle on this project I think for do
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to get together with
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
director right short that out yeah that
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
is not a today we that is not a thing we
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
not so would it be your
 
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.830 align:start position:0%
not so would it be your
proposal

01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that we use this amended language to add
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
to to take 518
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
without Senate Amendment and add that to
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
it and that's what we would do for now
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
and we have that yeah okay um I have a
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
side the or and matters appealed
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 31014 until the office
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
has issued a final decision this is the
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses yes and this is fine
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this is an issue for us
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
we could in addition to six language and
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
1610 yeah add some of these other change
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
I looked at a number of them um the one
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
on page five was fine um there okay so
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
keeping in the temporary the the
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
temporary license so that people can
 
01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
move forward while we're evaluating that
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
we can do that okay I'm fine with that
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%
and also on page nine there's another
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
change which is just this section it's
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
sort of a language but I mean I don't
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that certainly check
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
that out and then on page 11 of the side
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
by side the first one is just a fix we
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
missed I think from board to office
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
yep and um changing the uh the the
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
notice requirement to instead of having
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
it in here uh refer to U you know the
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 5.8 I mean you're fine everybody's
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
fine with that we can leave yeah we can
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
leave that that's fine yeah I looked
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
through this there was a number there's
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
another one here on page
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
14 yeah actually that's when I had a
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
question about I
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
think um our language was they cannot
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
meet Quorum and the Senate changed a
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
last lack sufficient members to and I
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a guess as to what the motive was
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
behind that but I if you could
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh speak to that that's fine
 
01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:32.669 align:start position:0%
uh speak to that that's fine
page

01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
14 I mean is that an issue that they
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
can't meet Quorum could be because for a
 
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
particular meeting they couldn't get
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
everybody there or enough people there
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
had a number we had a number of
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh conversations with a multitude of
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
boards who were struggling with um
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
getting Quorum and and there
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
was I don't know Senators if you can
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory there was some there
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about changing cor
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
to being 50% plus one in order to be
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
able to conduct business for a number of
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
boards this this could have been one I
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't I'm going to look at but this is a
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
more General I mean this is a more
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
General um I I guess um the Senate
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
version lacks sufficient members to for
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
them it really Narrows the parameter so
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
that the only reason that the ex itive
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
director could do this as if there's
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
lacking sufficient members rather than
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
any other reason why they couldn't I
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what that would be well I I
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
mean thinking about it myself I thought
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the situation for one particular
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
meeting they couldn't get enough people
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
to attend although there were enough
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
members who were appointed and confirmed
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
um and so that would let the director
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
executive director take over just
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
because one meeting they couldn't do it
 
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
and and yeah your version tightens it up
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
which I'm okay with
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay yeah um just to clarify
 
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
so the Quorum requirement for each
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
meeting versus per meeting your Senate
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
version gives that leway to
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
say for each meeting versus quum
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
requirement for the entirety of the
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
board they just can't get so I mean
 
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's everything I think we're fine
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
with all the changes the Senate made up
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
to uh page 27 in the side by
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
side um right maybe the the Senate can
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
explain what the changes why they added
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
this to the disciplinary
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
portion and whether or not I'm I'm just
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
concerned because we wa what page you
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
page 27 because in 20 when we did House
 
01:27:47.639 --> 01:27:49.109 align:start position:0%
page 27 because in 20 when we did House
Bill

01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
655 and we we made a lot of changes to
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
the to the disciplinary action
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
overall and I just want to make sure
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't conflict with that or
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
what the what the um reasoning was
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
thinking about and maybe
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
um Mr ostow can help with that
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
because this is so those are the those
 
01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
are the changes from page 27 in the side
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
38 I don't have a copy of that bill in
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
front of me is there anyone bill or this
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
can do you have a copy of the side by
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
at Doug if I remember correctly this was
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment that Senator Perkin cker
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
brought in if I'm not
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
mistaken yeah I didn't see it listed as
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
a separate amendment I didn't well I
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
think she did it in our committee
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
amended the bill in our committee okay
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
this is language she
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
changed that was part was part of a
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
larger Amendment maybe well I think it
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
part of the committee committe Amendment
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay part of the committee Amendment all
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
right I so the the amendment that
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka did so we had made
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
the ask we're we're finding not a lot of
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
value add from being notified by
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
insurance companies by Court getting
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
complaints were there's a lot of
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
redundancy we have to make sure that
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's getting paired and for complaints
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
and just enforcement purposes we weren't
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
finding a lot of value um
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
I think Senator Perkins kok I can't
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
speak for her but was a little
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and maybe had some
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
conversations outside where she wasn't
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
quite comfortable getting rid of this
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
language quite yet uh maybe something we
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
look at going forward for next year this
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
is what we added back this is what we
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
added back so the oplc had asked that
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
it' be stricken and Senator Perkin quok
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
was not comfortable with that um so does
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
this conflict with any of the other
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
quo so and what does this this actually
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
do what's the effect of
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
this of of the language and statute oh
 
01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
we when when individuals uh licensed
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
under the Board of Medicine are part of
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
a court case or a settlement agreement
 
01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
board uh the oplc is notified okay so
 
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
that would just keep that notification
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
in place and oplc didn't feel that that
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
had much value or not not really not
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
really because we're getting the same
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
complaints a lot of times the insurance
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
complaints is we don't necessarily have
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of facts or information to work
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
off of and we could get a list of names
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
of individuals and we don't know who was
 
01:30:37.149 --> 01:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
involved in what piece and what part so
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
there's not always something we can act
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
on in that say notification from an
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
insurance company so we're not we're not
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
particularly um there's just not a lot
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
of value from our perspective when we
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
have the complaints we have the
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
notifications from the courts those
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
types of things
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
represent so I'm just wondering if this
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
came out of the concerns that Senator
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
perus Koka had because we eliminated the
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
medical review board right yes so in in
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
eliminating that medical review board
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is we still want an
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
extra guard rail when it comes to
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
medical Clint especially since what
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
happened at Catholic Medical Center so
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
it's just an added um and I I understand
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that concern and if this is some if this
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
is like language that adds a safety to
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
that procedure and it doesn't it doesn't
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
conflict with language that we've
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
already put into place then it's okay
 
01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
and if we find that we don't use it we
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
don't use it but at the same time it's
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
there so I I do understand the concern I
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
understand I mean my if it's not if they
 
01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
don't find it useful my inclination
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
would be remov it but if the Senate
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
feels strongly that it should stay I'm
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay with that great yeah given um given
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
the removal of the medical Mal practice
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
really review board there was a intense
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
interest to keep reporting by
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurers and courts to oplc
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not going anywhere else
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd like to do is keep going
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
through the if you don't need it but put
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
it in a box and we'll come look at it
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
when we need it so where is the is is
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
the digitally verifiable portion start
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
on page 39
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
um yes section third box down section 15
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes this so we want to strike this this
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
is already in 135 so um and this is who
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out so that's I'm
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
fine and it goes to correct on that D
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
that that is the digital verifiable
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
portion starting on page
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
37 39 I'm sorry yeah the Bott the bottom
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
part in 39 that runs to the top part on
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
and just so we say it again out loud and
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering all of this I think I'm
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
looking straight at House Bill 1385
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
which has already gone to the governor
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
we've covered this yes we have no reason
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
to believe you will retail this no no
 
01:33:26.679 --> 01:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
to believe you will retail this no no
not

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
controversial thank you the digital
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
verification is not except for the
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
everything else the extension of a
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
temporary license so that people can get
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
right to work is all in there so would
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
the house be amendable to accepting our
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment we and we're
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
removing section 15 starting on page 39
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
all the way through the top of 43 and we
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
leave and then we need to add well
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's three other there's
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
three other sections side by side i'
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
like to go through just as okay briefly
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
yep um so on page 38 section 12 this is
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
um inspector so you wanted to change the
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
inspection on Barber Shop salons barber
 
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
shops and
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
schools once a year from twice a year is
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
that the middle of 38 can I speak to
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
that uh yes please so
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
um this is one of those things this was
 
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
at the office's request and essentially
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
right now in statute it's we're required
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
to inspect every shop in the state twice
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
a year the office had actually asked
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
for this to
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
be be stricken uh from the statue but
 
01:34:49.709 --> 01:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discomfort right that
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
sort of the what was the term used the
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
kitchen only clean when companies coming
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
over kind of things so uh we went back
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
and we our intent was originally to do
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
this in Rule and this is sort of the
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
negotiation between doing it twice a
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
year which is really not something we're
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
capable of doing with the amount of
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
staff we have right now um and making it
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
once a year the idea being one of those
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
would be tied to lure and license or
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
renewal and the second would be sort of
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
that drop in um just random inspection
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure people are abiding by rules
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
and statutes uh so this was the
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
negotiated piece because right now we're
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
required to go twice a year ah okay so
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
in a twoe SP I was thinking in I was
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
thinking every other year but no it's
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
twice a year no it's twice so in a
 
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
two-year licensing span we'd be in your
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
business four times okay this would make
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
it once a year so we' be there tce I'm
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
fine with this okay so that one's fine
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
and then the next one the bottom of 38
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
running to the top of the next
 
01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.790 align:start position:0%
running to the top of the next
page

01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
um okay so this just
 
01:36:00.159 --> 01:36:03.270 align:start position:0%
um okay so this just
changes

01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
sector I I can speak to this one too
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
pleas so so when director Courtney when
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
when she originally came and recruited
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
me and got me on board um her intent was
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
to have sort of one attorney who oversaw
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
the legal component of
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
oplc um for various reasons we've
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
discussed that didn't work out we
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
created a separate Branch but she really
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
wants to go back to um that original
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
idea where there' be the executive
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
director there will be one sort of Chief
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
legal person and that person would
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
oversee um attorneys for the agency
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys for the board rule writing and
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
hearings and it it makes sure all these
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
people with these legal component are
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
eventually going to are ultimately going
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
to answer to a an attorney supervisor uh
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
currently director Courtney has some of
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
these people direct answering to her
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
directly which is okay because she's
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
also a lawyer and sort of has that
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
understanding the executive
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
director may not always be an attorney
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
so this kind of puts that Safeguard in
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
place and then simultaneously because we
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
had these two positions created in
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
statute last year the the chief and the
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
agency Council um modifying that board
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
counsel Chief position to a chief of
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
staff position position because the
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
executive director right now has a lot
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
of responsibility and I think the people
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
who work with her day and day out think
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
there are certain responsibilities she
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
could be delegating um and this would be
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of Chief of Staff position
 
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
that would take on and and let that
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
director get out of the weeds and things
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
like Personnel matters and those types
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
of things uh that currently doesn't
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
really exist in our office okay look and
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
the next one on the middle of 39 looks
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
like it's related is that uh
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
oh that was the second piece that I was
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and then and then that that
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
box 14 is just saying both of those
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
positions would answer to the executive
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
director all right does anybody have an
 
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
objection to I mean I
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't okay uh was representative sign I
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
just need to ask Mr ostad if he needed
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
to declare conflict of interest in
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
this I can't presume I'll be put in that
 
01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.629 align:start position:0%
this I can't presume I'll be put in that
position

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
sir Okay so
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
I mean my understanding as it stands
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
actually is we would
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
take um HP 518 as it came out of the
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually with the Senate Amendment but
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
removing the amendment to section to
 
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.350 align:start position:0%
removing the amendment to section to
section

01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
15 um and then adding in the language
 
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.310 align:start position:0%
15 um and then adding in the language
from

01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
1610 and U okay and then there's a a
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
procedural question I haven't I've been
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
on Committees of conference I haven't
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
shared one at this point do we actually
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
need to get an amendment vote on it or
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
vote on this intent and we'll get the
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
amendment vote on the intent draft
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
committee report reflecting that and
 
01:39:02.109 --> 01:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
I'll go down to all us and get the
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and we all sign off after we
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
read it okay cool so we have V
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
separately yeah I understand that one
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
I've seen so any anything else represent
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
gr no I would make I would make a motion
 
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
to the house members that we okay you
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
guys accept that may I ask a question
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
before we do that so there is language
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Amendment 518
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
correct okay there is language in House
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 518 and House Bill 1622 that
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
modifies the same statute RSA
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
3108 uh we worked in the Senate with doj
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
very closely we would like the language
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
in 1622 to be the language so is this
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
the language that's in the amendment
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
1610 can I so I don't think this I think
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
it passed both the Senate and the house
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
518 in 1622 but it didn't get changed in
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
518 can I just make a comment we have a
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee of conference this after on
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
1622 we like the language of 1622 we
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the language of 518
 
01:40:06.189 --> 01:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflict with it and if it we
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to end up in sort of a a
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
signing race so so what we would like to
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
do is take the language from 1622 and we
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
want that ultimately well I'm not I'm
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
not just my confusion I'm not sure
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what language you're talking
 
01:40:25.149 --> 01:40:25.159 align:start position:0%
about is it yes I do is it the
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
332g language or so in on in House Bill
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
518 I'm looking at
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
the the actual bill as amended by the
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
Senate um page two line
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
moment Mr chair is it on side by side oh
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
no he's I don't know if it would be in
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
talking about 1622 right now
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
it won't be in the side by side if Nei
 
01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
you know if the Senate didn't change it
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
so in in House Bill 518 as amended by
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
the Senate it's on page two yeah
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
beginning in line 14 going through line
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
18 can you just give us what the words
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have line numbers and what
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking at I do it's RSA 3108
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
2 oh yeah that's a different we have
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
appealed RSA
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
31014 oh I pulled I pulled mine off the
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
website I'm not well actually I got it I
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
mean there's this is section three I
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
mean I printed this off the website
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
license renewals laps
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
3108 and you're the section you're
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
talking about is is Roman 2 correct and
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh and what it says is two licenses
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
shall be valid for two years from the
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
date of issurance except for those
 
01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
apprentices licensed for one year in
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
accordance with rules adopted pursuant
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
to 541 when I provided the timely and
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
complete application for license
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
renewals by eligible applicants shall
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
continue the validity of the license
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
being renewed until the offic has acted
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
on the renewal application and that's
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
existing language and it adds or in
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
matters appealed pursuant to RSA 310
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
colon 14 until the office has issued a
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
final decision is that change yes so in
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
1622 section one
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
modifies the same paragraph and this is
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
the language I I worked with doj on both
 
01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
of these so it's different language it
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
is different language I can read it if
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
you'd like yes sir could we just strike
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
that entire paragraph right out of this
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
bill I think so there'd be no change to
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill there'd be no change in 518
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
and then 1622 would become the language
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
preva I'm actually looking at section
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
three which that's part of and that
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
appears to be the only oh no it's
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
repealed and reenacted
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
so but really for Section 3 is that the
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
only change that this is making it looks
 
01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.669 align:start position:0%
only change that this is making it looks
like

01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
that in which case we can just in the
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
amendment could just remove section
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
three um signon it could assuming that
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
1622 for whatever reason doesn't go down
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
in flames this afternoon right so I'm
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
looking at to see let me just look to
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
see what 1622 looks like before we go
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
yeah let's just one moment I'm looking
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
at that because I'm because I know I'm
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
on that committee conference the other
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
option would be to put the 1622 language
 
01:43:32.589 --> 01:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
in here and then in 1622 you could pull
 
01:43:32.599 --> 01:43:33.430 align:start position:0%
in here and then in 1622 you could pull
it

01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
out I don't know was the only change to
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the language that we added back in
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
LIC no no we changed that totally which
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
from the Senate 162 I don't remember
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
that one at all I forget what that one's
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
dou what was 1622 1622 has to do with
 
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:57.790 align:start position:0%
dou what was 1622 1622 has to do with
the

01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
notification of rule making remember
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is what did the Senate change I'm
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
looking I'm looking just a moment I see
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
a house version and I see an Senate
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
version and the sener version has the
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
part about license the first thing is
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
about license renewal laps so we just
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that we and and they
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
do talk about the notification of Ru
 
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
making so we just have to make sure that
 
01:44:30.669 --> 01:44:30.679 align:start position:0%
in the 1622 committee conference we
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
leave that paragraph as is and I believe
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl you're on that committee
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
with me so we're going to make sure that
 
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
we I'm going to circle this paragraph
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we keep that in 1622
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
and we take it out of here okay so
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
that's the entirety of section two
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
director of legislative Services
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
publishing amend no it talks about it's
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
licensed renewal laps right underneath
 
01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.830 align:start position:0%
licensed renewal laps right underneath
that

01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
though just that one paragraph Roman two
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah just Ro just Roman two yes the
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
license shall be would it make more
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
sense just to take that language and put
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
it in here to be safe and that way
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict we have consistency
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
bills okay it's fine oh yes just in case
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
something happens is okay so we could do
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
that can you keep track of all the stuff
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm making notes um that one that I
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
got to figure out what I got to find it
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
so I get i'll represent MTI while want
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
me to just forward this you you would
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
um you know in 1622 Senate version it
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
also refers to uh RSA 310 colon
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
8 and is repealed two is repealed and
 
01:45:46.719 --> 01:45:48.510 align:start position:0%
8 and is repealed two is repealed and
reenacted

01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
reenacted
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
so right and then it refers to RSA 54 4
 
01:45:58.510 --> 01:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
RS that so that won't change and the
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
only change that we're seeing is the RSA
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
310 colon 2 I would be very careful
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
about that statement because this bolded
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
language was changed from the bill as
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
proposed but I don't have the language
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
of RSA 318 in front of me and it I would
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
say it would not be my style to repeal
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
and replace the whole section unless
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
there were other changes but they would
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
not be bolded because it'd be considered
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
new language so I I think the safest bet
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
would be take the language of 1622 that
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph two drop it into
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
518 and
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
then yep so we're basic we should end up
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
with the language we're going to replace
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
licenses shall be valid for two years
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot dot until the office has
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
issued a final decision
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
with licenses issued by the office shall
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
be valued for two years from the date of
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
issuance dot dot dot dot the licensing
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
terms established by this section self
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
sued any conflicting terms established
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
in the statute is administered by the
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
board listed in R you're reading that
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
from is that 1622 as amended by the
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
Senate yeah and what page in line is it
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
it's on page one okay it's SEC right on
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
section one it starts with the license
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
renewals and it's paragraph two licenses
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
issued by the office I'm looking at um
 
01:47:27.679 --> 01:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
issued by the office I'm looking at um
Amendment

01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
202 I just looked up hb1 1622 and it's
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
showing there's something wrong they're
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
showing no amendments even though they
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
here4 go back
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
to you want to look at my well I want I
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I can find it so then
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
when I go TOS I actually have something
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
I can point to
 
01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:02.270 align:start position:0%
I can point to
um

01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it appears in
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
58 section 310 we only made a change in
 
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph two amended by the if we
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
repeal and reenact all of that reenacted
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
language would be considered new and it
 
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't show up as bolded so I would
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
need I'm wrote this a year ago so would
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
need to go back and look at I don't want
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
to make a mistake here that we regret
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
later yeah that's why I think the
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
safest um but where's the change this is
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
the language look at the CH because it's
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's um here's two
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
Roman it's only in section two the rest
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
of it appears to be the same all right
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
so we're doing this kind of on the Fly
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure we don't yeah
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not comfortable but I
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on
 
01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
so so what we're doing is we're going to
 
01:48:58.109 --> 01:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
add paragraph
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
two on 1622 and replace this paragraph
 
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph two on 518 that's all we're
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to do that's all we're doing
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's all we're talking about yeah so
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
exactly and the rest the rest rest of
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment alone if there is a change
 
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
we're not picking up and frankly to me
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is the harder way to do it but it
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
is the safest way to do it if we want to
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
of to restrictions imposed
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
by okay it only goes to 31 so inside
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
is10 where on the side by side is
 
01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:48.679 align:start position:0%
that we take we take Section out of 1622
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
Place into and swap it out right here
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
here yes exactly what I have yes then
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
then this representative leus this is
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest we retain Fidelity
 
01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
right use section 2 1622 language and
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
put it into 58 simple as it okay and so
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
this I'm looking at 1622 as amended by
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
the Senate and so you're saying section
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
two is this is that good doesn't look
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
lies should be valid now you have right
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
um lines two through so it's actually
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
section one yeah I don't know what it is
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
in this is amended by the Senate what
 
01:50:38.589 --> 01:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is US 1622 language whatever
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
section it is one I don't know but it's
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
section oh you're looking at
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
382 right so this is the Senate um uh
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
1622 as amended by the Senate so to read
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
as F and so taking section one
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
basically yeah but it's section
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
two Roman two okay so
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
basically yeah I just trying to get the
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
right way to refer to it and so to for
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
Olaf so what I'm what I'm saying is if
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
um hb1
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
one actually it's all of that section
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
one is only doing that
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph and then include
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
that yes and that's the only change
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
right okay so just to review what I my
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that um we adopt
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
everything in the side by side so the
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment the whole Senate
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment we keep except for section 15
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
yes okay we're going to add the language
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
from the amendment 1610 yep and we're
 
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
going to replace um this the language in
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
HB 518 is amended by the Senate page two
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
lines 14 to 18 with the uh language from
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
1622 is amended by the Senate um section
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
one which is only that part no no not
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
section one paragraph two we don't want
 
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
to lines two through seven right that's
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
all we want to do we do not want to add
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
section one where we say license renewal
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
lapse blah blah blah that's already in
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
here I don't know if he has the Virgin
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
up with the numbers on it but it's lines
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
two through seven on the amendment yeah
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get that with the number um
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
that are you guys comfortable now with
 
01:52:53.119 --> 01:52:55.149 align:start position:0%
that are you guys comfortable now with
that

01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes so you'll need to vote on that and
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on this we're Le in all
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
medical that was my only concern was
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
that caveat the committee members from
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
1622 have to remember to take that
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph out of I'll be there this
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon we don't want the same thing
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
they don't actually have to take it out
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
as long as it's the same language it
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
won't be a conflict okay great that's
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
why we're amending it to okay that's
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
fine perfect be no conflict then it
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter which one's signed in
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
language basically creating the
 
01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
redundancy yeah we're just parting the
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
language and it doesn't matter which
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
one's first or last because it'll be the
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
same okay and actually I've got the
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
version now with line numbers and what
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
did you say for line numbers uh lines
 
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
two through seven page one lines 2
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
through S let me see if that looks right
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
works all right I think I'm I'm
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%

02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
some concerns in the fact that um um
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
basically protecting the safet and
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
healthy of some of the patients and you
 
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
might have gotten this letter but it one
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
it created a certification requirement
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
for some of the um outpatient treat
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
treatment providers because according
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's actually a couple letters um
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
currently 65 there are 65 Outpatient
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
Treatment organizations um registered
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid and those DHHS um
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
contracts with nine so they're basic
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
they have no oversight the remaining 56
 
02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
have no oversight so they had concerns
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
about that um we don't want another um
 
02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
incident like the youth de the sen
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
Center so um new Futures came in with
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
that and the second part of it uh
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
establishes a behavioral health position
 
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
within the DHHS office the um budsman
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
now I did have a chance to read some of
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
the um concerns from um or not concerns
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
but Jennifer o Higgins from our hearing
 
02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.950 align:start position:0%
but Jennifer o Higgins from our hearing
report

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.229 align:start position:0%
report
um

02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:56.669 align:start position:0%
um
their

02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
um they she where's
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
she um she did have um detailed some of
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
the some of the points in this so as far
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned um new Futures asked
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
for it um and I know Senator Carson um
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
see some of it or if not some of it if
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
not all of it to go
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
through and we have a representative
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
from we have Mr Barry from new Futures
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
would you like
 
02:10:34.589 --> 02:10:34.599 align:start position:0%
to so the the uh concerns
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
that we'd like you to address if you
 
02:10:40.510 --> 02:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
could is how this would be managed
 
02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:41.629 align:start position:0%
could is how this would be managed
within

02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
HHS and I know that you're a
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative from HHS is not here sure
 
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could also address the
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
concerns that for example I would
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
imagine that the certification program
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that all the recovery
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
facilities or substantive utilities
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
operate on the same
 
02:11:09.069 --> 02:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
standard and if they have to be
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
licensed how is it that we need this
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
added so that's the question how if we
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
already have the individuals certified
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
and they're supposed to be operating on
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
the same standard why do we need an
 
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
additional certification program sure I
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
think that would
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
help yeah okay
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
ahead there we go all right thank you um
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
that's it all right um so as you know
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
new Futures has been working to address
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
substance use and addiction in our state
 
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
for over 25 years we've been working on
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
this bill with Senator Carson and other
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
supporters going back to last summer um
 
02:11:58.549 --> 02:11:58.559 align:start position:0%
just to provide some clarity where this
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
came from you may have uh seen or heard
 
02:12:03.069 --> 02:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
where the 13th Step which was a an
 
02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
award-winning podcast series from New
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public radio that detailed
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
patterns and and culture of sexual
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
assault and harassment with one of our
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
largest treatment networks in the State
 
02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh let me be clear the treatment Network
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
in question in that podcast was a
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
residential treatment program largely
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
Residential Services which are not
 
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill because residential
 
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are already licensed but what
 
02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
that podcast did expose was a a sort of
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
a long held um a little known secret
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
within the substance use treatment World
 
02:12:32.549 --> 02:12:32.559 align:start position:0%
about a lack of oversight over another
 
02:12:34.109 --> 02:12:34.119 align:start position:0%
class of treatment providers being
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
Outpatient Treatment in our state uh for
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
outpatient treatment providers there um
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
there is individual lure for clinicians
 
02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
which I'll come back to in a moment um
 
02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
but beyond that there is no facility
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
licensing there is no facility
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
certification currently there is no um
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
oversight and as Senator burel mentioned
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
for a great many of these providers
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's no record within the state of
 
02:12:56.589 --> 02:12:56.599 align:start position:0%
where they provide what class of
 
02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
services or what quality of services
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
they provide or who they are um we
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
really see that as leaving you know
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
these these patients who are at their
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable point being at risk for
 
02:13:11.069 --> 02:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
abuses or misconduct or at at minimum
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
substandard service which is something
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
that impacts not only their own recovery
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
but the quality of our entire treatment
 
02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
Network across the board we spend a a a
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
great great deal of money to prop up
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
this treatment Network to ensure these
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
services are provided in folks but it's
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
really only as strong as the weakest
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
provider and we really want to make sure
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
that everybody's operating by the same
 
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
standards the same qualities of care and
 
02:13:34.109 --> 02:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
so on and again right now there's no
 
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
real way of ensuring that um as far as
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there is individual
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
clinician lure within the state and
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
individuals can be held responsible but
 
02:13:45.069 --> 02:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
what we have heard word of around the
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
state are organizations that we'll say
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
play a little bit loose with the rules
 
02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
and which uh um you know they are
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
crowding group therapy sessions far
 
02:13:55.390 --> 02:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
beyond the ratios that are considered to
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
be best practice um they are employing
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
um recovery professionals who are not so
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
far along in their own recovery that
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
they are not supposed to be providing
 
02:14:05.709 --> 02:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
that level of support or Services which
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
again leaves them leaves them at risk as
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
well as their patients uh if individual
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
folks are the only people held
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for this if they are removed
 
02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh there's still incentive for the these
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
organizations to just put somebody else
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
in the same position to do the same
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
thing which leaves the the clinician I
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
mean leaves the patients at risk again
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
for these abuses and misconduct uh so
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
this really is intended to to plug that
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
hole in sort of oversight or authority
 
02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the that the state can uh
 
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
know who these again who these providers
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
are where they're operating and really
 
02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
try to hold them
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
to certain standards of of service in
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
order to U prop up their own service and
 
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
again make sure that our entire network
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
which again we work so hard to fund uh
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
is is uh providing quality services
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
across the board um and so to make sure
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that folks are getting the treatment
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
that they need and that we're making
 
02:14:58.830 --> 02:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
good use of the money that we are
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
spending on our treatment services does
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for being here uh
 
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question um
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
so from my understanding nobody's
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea of the bill but
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
still the house Health and Human
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
Services committee came out with a 191
 
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation for interim study sure
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
the one person wanting to kill the bill
 
02:15:25.870 --> 02:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
altogether so the vast majority of the
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
people felt like this needed more work
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I was assured by them that they plan
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
on doing that work um can you speak into
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you've heard from that
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee at all and why they want to
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
move this to interum study and their
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
concerns about this language because we
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't have anybody here I'm I'm I'm
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
happy yes and I do I believe that my
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
colleague that Mr Higgins from DJJ is on
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
her way I think she's aiming to be here
 
02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
to answer some of these questions there
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
were questions raised in uh with the
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
health house Health and Human Services
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee around uh who would be held to
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
these certification requirement what
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
class of providers there was some um I
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
would say some misunderstanding about uh
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
you know this bill is really intended to
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
Pro apply to Clinical Services only it's
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
not it does not apply to Alcoholics
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
Anonymous it does not apply to other
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
self-help groups um that has not been
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the Lang that had not
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
been spelled out in the language of the
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
bill um because we thought that the
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
reference to clinical patient services
 
02:16:23.549 --> 02:16:23.559 align:start position:0%
with suffice but there were some
 
02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions and and again I would say some
 
02:16:27.149 --> 02:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings around that there is
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely no intention here to apply to
 
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh again AA self-help other non-clinical
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
services like that I did work uh with
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
certain committee members on an
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
amendment that ultimately didn't did not
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
get put forward on language that would
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
clarify uh who which which classes of
 
02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:44.599 align:start position:0%
providers this would apply to as well as
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh what exemptions exist uh the this
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
Lang and I'm happy to share this
 
02:16:50.509 --> 02:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
language with you if that would be
 
02:16:53.469 --> 02:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
helpful clarifies that um again res
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
residential services are exempt because
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
they're already covered by facility
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
licensing individual practitioners are
 
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
exempt because they're already covered
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
by individual professional lure um and
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh again self-help and AAA another
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
program other group programs like that
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
are exempt because again that's just not
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill in any way
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to share that that that was
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
the Crux of some of the questions we
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
heard thank you um so that was part of
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
the discussion though and how and Human
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
Services it it was okay and and at the
 
02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
end of that you were not able to assuage
 
02:17:28.990 --> 02:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
their concerns that this didn't apply to
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
those groups from the sounds of things
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
because they moved 191 to interim study
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
so it was part of the conversation but
 
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
it didn't resolve the issue to be the
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
simple fact it we ran out of time that
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to be a second commune
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
bill and the deadline was was you know
 
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
was was that afternoon we had um the
 
02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
hearing I think was held 5 days before
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
the deadline or something along those
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
lines and the simple fact was that that
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
we ran out of time time uh and uh to
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were raised I
 
02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
was hopeful that this um this amendment
 
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh that we had worked on would address
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
them but um the committee felt that they
 
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
just didn't have enough time uh what I
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
would say U certainly we appreciate the
 
02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
intentionality of of uh uh uh the
 
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
legislature and taking its time with
 
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
this but there there's some urgency here
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
the longer that we have people out there
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
attending these these unregulated
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
uncertified uh treatment providers again
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
the more at risk they are again for for
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
misconduct abuses substandard services
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
and again that more them that more the
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
more that costs them individually and it
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
state um having said that do you have
 
02:18:39.309 --> 02:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
statistics as far as um incidences in
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
the licens OR own license facilities
 
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
that would indicate the urgency so you
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
know um you're saying there's urgency
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
because there's danger of things
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
happening is that happening at a
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
prolific level outside of theu Center
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
obviously but in other areas or we're
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
just noticing that it could again it's
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to know which is why
 
02:18:58.589 --> 02:18:58.599 align:start position:0%
part of why we're here because there is
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
no mechanis there's no oversight
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism there's no ability for the
 
02:19:03.629 --> 02:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
state to track these things to to take
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
those kind of complaints currently
 
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to put into
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
place here thank you sure you
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative goul and thenes Senator
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
prenis thank you Senator penis no
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative gr then Senator prce
 
02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you thank you madam
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
question so I remember a few years ago
 
02:19:31.870 --> 02:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
an Expose and I don't think it was the
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
NPR thing but maybe it was and I was
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
praying somebody would be here with a
 
02:19:38.669 --> 02:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
better memory and more active in the
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
field than I have been for many many
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
years but it was about a young Dynamic
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
individual who created a very exciting
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
program and about many workers that got
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
involved and were really really excited
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
about a addressing the very serious
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues we have in New
 
02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:56.190 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues we have in New
Hampshire

02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
but then a funny thing happened and
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
money kind of got in the way and and the
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
numbers were being increased and
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
increased and increased and increased
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the pressure on the workers was
 
02:20:08.349 --> 02:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more intense and it
 
02:20:09.870 --> 02:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
finally got to the point that it was
 
02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
very abusive to both the staff and the
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
participants in the program and I I
 
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
don't recall the name of the program but
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
I do remember it was a serious concern
 
02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
well my question for you is that I'm
 
02:20:25.469 --> 02:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
really concerned about is that if we are
 
02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
relying on the licenses of individual
 
02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
clinicians to follow their requirements
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
in providing services but we have no
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
oversight none zero oversight on the
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
entity hiring them we then are putting
 
02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
those clinicians in the position of
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
having to be the oversight for agencies
 
02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
that pay them a salary is that correct
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
am I understanding that correctly
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative know that that's
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely right if there you know and
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
and again what we there's been sort of
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
an unkempt secret within the treatment
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
world and we heard this uh in you know
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
in testimony at the house you know the
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
house hearing the Senate hearing from
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
all kinds of treatment providers that um
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know our best treatment providers in
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
the state or treatment providers all
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
over the state are serving patients who
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
are coming from other programs that that
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
were did not receive the level of care
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
and support that they needed and this
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know this makes it more challenging
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
more timec consuming and more expensive
 
02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
for these programs to to to be able to
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
get these people on a path to recovery
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
who have already been through um at best
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
case substandard service at worst case
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
trauma coming out of some of these
 
02:21:37.309 --> 02:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
things and
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
um because there are certain and and I I
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't think there are many of them and
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
again we're really just we're going by
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotes because we haven't an
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
inability to track it but there are some
 
02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh treatment providers in the state
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
where there's just a culture of chasing
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
some of the money that you're talking
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
about and and let's make no mistake
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
there um there's a fair amount of money
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
available through Medicaid which and
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank God it is that's what supports our
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
entire network but there are some folks
 
02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
who are driven more by that the
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
potential Revenue than they are by care
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
for patients um and to put to hold an
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
individual clinician responsible for the
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
culture of an organization that is out
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
there sacrificing quality of service for
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
um for the the bottom line for revenues
 
02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
um for the the bottom line for revenues
is

02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
um not only I think somewhat misplaced
 
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
and and a little irresponsible in a way
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
to chase quality clinicians out of the
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
field and in my
 
02:22:35.469 --> 02:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
view thank you very much for that uh I
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
have another question somewhat related
 
02:22:40.750 --> 02:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm understanding or that
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is accurate in some of
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
these organizations don't we have a
 
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
mixture of licensed clinicians and kind
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
of peer-to-peer
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
or um sort of the self-help aspect that
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
you were referring to so um so that we
 
02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
would have licensed clinicians being
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
held to a standard an agency not held to
 
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
any standard and then self-help level
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
kind of people that are not licensed
 
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
that are in there also not held to any
 
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
standard is that
 
02:23:17.269 --> 02:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
correct I'm I want to make sure I
 
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
understand the question but it certainly
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
sounds none of these things are mut
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
exclusive right you can you know you do
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
have some um Treatment Center you know
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
treatment provider organizations that
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
provide outpatient residential treatment
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
and they will provide some level of
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
recovery support either inhouse or
 
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
either through a contract with a
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
recovery Community organization or
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
something along those lines so yeah and
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
some of them will do you know provide um
 
02:23:43.269 --> 02:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
just clinical treatments some will
 
02:23:43.279 --> 02:23:44.469 align:start position:0%
just clinical treatments some will
provide

02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm looking for religious
 
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
based treatment which is which is again
 
02:23:50.269 --> 02:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
not considered clinical but it's another
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's another approach so there you
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
know there is certainly a mix of
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
providers across the board but this
 
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
isn't again intended to provide only to
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
those folks to those organizations that
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
provide uh clinical Treatment Services
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh and not not getting into self-help
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
and others last
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
followup okay thank you so so thank you
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think that confirms what I'm saying my
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
point being that we have licensed
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
clinicians who are sandwiched in some
 
02:24:21.550 --> 02:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
cases between um organizations that are
 
02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
unregulated who who control their bread
 
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
and butter their paycheck their their
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
support for their family and and other
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
sideline uh services that might be
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the agency that are
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
also unlicensed practitioners who are
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
out there performing whereas if we had
 
02:24:42.269 --> 02:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
licensed providers and licensed
 
02:24:46.349 --> 02:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
clinicians these um self-help sort of
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of a program would have two
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
layers of supervision a clinician stuck
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
in the middle and and if I can add um
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
that that's really the intention of the
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
second provision of of what was sen Bill
 
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
495 related to the position with the EMB
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
budman's office is to ensure that there
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
is a dedicated sort of place that staff
 
02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
members is in addition to patients can
 
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
go when they are witnessed to are being
 
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
asked to provide substandard service
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
right that they um uh uh we want to make
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
sure that that we have somebody who is
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
properly trained and equipped to respond
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
to those kind of complaints because
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
again we we know it's out there and
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully if we put the certification
 
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory system in place there
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
will be more complaints coming
 
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
in Senator
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
princess thank you representative Broda
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
and um um thank you Jake uh Mr Barry for
 
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
taking my questions um so you are
 
02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
talking here about we've got these
 
02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
providers that
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
are are we've got these providers that
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
are out floating between different what
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
would currently be defined as facilities
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
providing care but the care the care
 
02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
treatment services but the centers or
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
facilities that they're providing
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
treatment Cent treatment at are not
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
licensed so there's no regulatory
 
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
oversight but the Prov I think I'm
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
repeating what's already been said but
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going somewhere to make sure I've
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
got this clear so we have all the
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
providers but no Mothership to be
 
02:26:13.269 --> 02:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
Tethered to from a li insure and a
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
quality control perspective correct if
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
there is a complaint filed against right
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
now if there is again substandard
 
02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
Treatment Services being applied to
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not sticking to clinical
 
02:26:27.150 --> 02:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
standards and so on the only complaint
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
that can be filed is against the
 
02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
individual practitioner which again does
 
02:26:32.670 --> 02:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
not address the issue if you are if
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's an organization that is uh
 
02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
inspired to uh uh purposely evade these
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
these treatment standards uh and I hope
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
this answers some of the question c um
 
02:26:48.990 --> 02:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
but we you know again there are some we
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
know of some
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
provider organizations that are
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
motivated by Revenue by bottom lines uh
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
as much as they are more so than they
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
are patient care which leads them to
 
02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
kind of flout uh treatment standards and
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
it is not an issue in individual
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
clinician it is an organizational issue
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
so if you have if there is a clinician
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
that is removed they would potentially
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
be placed with someone else who will
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
again similarly flout those those
 
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
Service uh standards and leave patients
 
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
does that answer the question it's it's
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to me so um
 
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
followup so U Mr Barry would it be your
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
position that um alcohol and drug use
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
are public health emergencies health and
 
02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
Public Safety emergencies in the state
 
02:27:41.550 --> 02:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
certainly so and I would think that by
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
the you know again the amount of time
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
and resources that have been devoted in
 
02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
the state over the last 10 years to
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
build a treatment system uh that is
 
02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
capable of I think that
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the state as a whole
 
02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes this as a public health
 
02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
emergency and again this is I would
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
argue this is just part of the natural
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
maturation of the system we have tried
 
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
to uh to put in place to make sure that
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
we are protecting um everyone in our
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
state especially the most vulnerable
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
Among Us who are in need of these
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
services and again to make sure the
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
money we're spending is being well spent
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
and well guarded thank you Al I will
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
note that my uh Miss from DHHS is here
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
now as well would you like to join Mr
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.349 --> 02:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
so I I'd like to take the conversation
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
after listening to everybody in into
 
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
this vein so the state is invested in
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol abuse substance abuse
 
02:28:38.269 --> 02:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
correct and um the F facilities receive
 
02:28:41.269 --> 02:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
money for those to support that the work
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
that they do but those facilities are
 
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
independent of any kind of certification
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
or registration that we have with in the
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
state so although we give them funding
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
we really don't
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
know their per let's just call it their
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
performance record or
 
02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
their treatment record is that or the
 
02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
way they treat people is that correct so
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
this bill actually just expands those
 
02:29:10.429 --> 02:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
that even don't have state funding So
 
02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
currently if you have receive state
 
02:29:14.429 --> 02:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
funding there is some amount of oversite
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
or the ability to certify those who
 
02:29:19.309 --> 02:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
receive funding but we know there to be
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
um at least six 5 outpatient facilities
 
02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
registered with Medicaid and of those
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
only nine receive funding through the
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
state so the oversight piece doesn't
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
exist for others that operate as an
 
02:29:31.319 --> 02:29:33.389 align:start position:0%
exist for others that operate as an
outpatient

02:29:33.389 --> 02:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
outpatient
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
clinic and if I can note those are only
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that take Medicaid when we
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
think about all of the you know those
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
that that do not they are not on the map
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere they they there's no contract
 
02:29:45.269 --> 02:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
there's no record within the state of of
 
02:29:45.279 --> 02:29:47.670 align:start position:0%
there's no record within the state of of
them

02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever okay does that
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
um lead the committee to any questions
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
that they might have in their mind yes
 
02:29:57.389 --> 02:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative berel thank you very much
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm looking in looking at the
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
bill this bill requires that do we not
 
02:30:07.710 --> 02:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
already have an armed budsman department
 
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
particular um we do so anything that
 
02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
falls under DHHS can fall the current um
 
02:30:19.269 --> 02:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
budsman because this bill would be uh
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive of of those outpatient
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
facilities for whom do not receive state
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
funding we they then those Services
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
would then fall under the current um
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
budsman this bill does add a position
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
that would have more expertise in the
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
area of Behavioral Health within the
 
02:30:37.309 --> 02:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
existing ombudsman's office
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
followup so and I'm I'm looking at the
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
language and it says subject to
 
02:30:43.469 --> 02:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
available funding the department shall
 
02:30:46.030 --> 02:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
designate within the office of um
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
budsman a person as Behavioral Health so
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's they'll only assign it if they
 
02:30:55.230 --> 02:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
have the fin the funding for it correct
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you it if I can note that you
 
02:30:59.710 --> 02:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
know we should note that there's no
 
02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation attached this bill there's
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
no dollars and cents really what this
 
02:31:05.550 --> 02:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
does is Task the the department with
 
02:31:07.269 --> 02:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
going through rul making with create you
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
know with creating the certification
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
standards this is beginning a process
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
that will um uh uh that will ultimately
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
result in the the certification
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
Authority but but this is the this is
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a process
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you there's no appropriation per
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
se to it but it does give the ability to
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
to Levy fees on on facilities
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
correct yes so if we were to adopt the
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
rules but because there is the
 
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
contingency language and there of
 
02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
subject to available funding we would
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to know the department would have
 
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
to know that we have the staff to
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
actually certify these facilities and
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
oversee their quality before we would
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
adopt the rules right because we
 
02:31:48.389 --> 02:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to start saying you have
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be certified if could not understand
 
02:31:53.469 --> 02:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
the quality of your programming then we
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
would be you know just certifying places
 
02:31:57.269 --> 02:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
and sort of giving a false sense of
 
02:31:59.469 --> 02:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
security that they have oversight so
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
until such time as we would have the
 
02:32:04.030 --> 02:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
staff to do the oversight then we would
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
adopt those rules so again like to
 
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
Jake's point it's the baby step of we
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
need there's so much details that need
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be figured out about what would be in
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
a certification program that it allows
 
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
us to start to work with facilities to
 
02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
figure out what needs to be in the rul
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
making and then at such time as there is
 
02:32:23.269 --> 02:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
available funding to do to have the
 
02:32:24.990 --> 02:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing to certify and oversee the
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
quality we could
 
02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
Implement okay Senator burel one last
 
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
question so let me just get this
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
straight so um this is just opening up
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
the door to looking at the rules and
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
setting up the process and then possibly
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
next year during the budget process
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
putting the funding in if everything's
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
lined up at that point then next year
 
02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
during the funding budget process
 
02:32:55.710 --> 02:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
putting the money into the budget for
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
you so let if I could if I could follow
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
up with
 
02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
that this is this is important I think
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is an important part of the
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
discussion If This Were to be added what
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
it allows the um Department to do the
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
agent to do is to start putting together
 
02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:22.790 align:start position:0%
agent to do is to start putting together
a

02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
program because without that you really
 
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
can't ask for funding because you won't
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
have anything to to ask for right and
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
but if you don't get the funding then
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
this can't happen because you won't be
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
able to fund
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
it okay so my question is if we have 65
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
this is if we have 65 registered
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that take Medicare and nine
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
are funded by the stat so we have
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
purview over those nine that means we
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
have 55 that don't what's the incentive
 
02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
for those
 
02:33:59.309 --> 02:33:59.319 align:start position:0%
55 to be
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
to what's see what would is it just
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
because we're putting it in statue that
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
they have to do it and and then what
 
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
didn't in the state without this
 
02:34:14.349 --> 02:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
certification so there the incentive is
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
to practice but um ultimately that's
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
also just those are the Medicaid that
 
02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
those who take Medicaid numbers again
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
are just giving us an estimate of the
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
scope of work that's happening that
 
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
we're unsure about so I think Mr Barry
 
02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
also had mentioned how just
 
02:34:32.349 --> 02:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
understanding the landscape of treatment
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
services is an important step forward
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire because when we get a
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
call from you know someone who needs
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
Services when we don't know where
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're all located and the quality of
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
them it's very hard to make a referral
 
02:34:48.990 --> 02:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
so those who we do know who receive
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
state funding
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
who we work closely with and collaborate
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
with today or who is going to receive
 
02:34:56.349 --> 02:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
all of the referrals through those State
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
programs but understanding the landscape
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
and quality of treatment services also
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
expands where we can refer people and
 
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
even if they don't receive you know take
 
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid there are lots of folks who
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
have other health insurance who still
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
need treatment so expanding our
 
02:35:14.110 --> 02:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of the landscape of care
 
02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
goes a long way for us as a state as
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
well okay that's helpful and I really
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
believe representative Simon has a
 
02:35:19.439 --> 02:35:20.630 align:start position:0%
believe representative Simon has a
question

02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it um so this
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
this ultimately if I'm understanding it
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
correct correctly is a facility
 
02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
license certification but it's it's
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
similar to a license um in order to be
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
able to hold um these facilities
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
accountable to certain standards now um
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming even though they're not
 
02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
certified under the state of New
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are there things that they
 
02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
could do that would be considered
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
illegal and criminal from a facility
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint that the state could step in
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
somebody came to the utsman from one of
 
02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
these facilities and says this is
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
happening in this facility and it's
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
illegal that the facility could still be
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
held accountable to that illegality is
 
02:36:05.269 --> 02:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
is that correct or multiple layers exist
 
02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the clinician's license
 
02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
so the licensing board plays a part if
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
the facility is residential it's already
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
licensed so we're talking about the
 
02:36:17.469 --> 02:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
outpatient piece so if a facility is
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
licensed then there's a way to you know
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue a complaint that would be covered
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
by both the um budsman and our licensing
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
unit um if the if this facility receives
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
State funding yes it falls under the EMB
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
budsman and the Bureau of drug and
 
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol services but the other other
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
operators who don't fall into those
 
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
categories exist without that oversight
 
02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
there is the way that they you could
 
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
report the clinician to the licensing
 
02:36:45.309 --> 02:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
board or um criminal activity of course
 
02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
could be reported to law enforcement if
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
I could add representative uh certainly
 
02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
I think you criminal activity is not the
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
only standard here in the worst case
 
02:36:55.469 --> 02:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
certainly is but we're really trying
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to talk about is uh
 
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
quality of service and ensuring that
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
people are being held to service
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
standards that again uh help people to
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
achieve their recovery uh help these
 
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
organ you know and help organizations
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
all across the network do their job of
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
getting people into into recovery and
 
02:37:11.790 --> 02:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
again uh which which helps individuals
 
02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
but also assures that our state
 
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
investment in this is is money well
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
spent right so so do I understand that
 
02:37:21.389 --> 02:37:21.399 align:start position:0%
the the data is a
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
problem but it would be helpful to me in
 
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
in making this decision to know that the
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
facilities that are presently under the
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the department and have
 
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
oversight are producing per capita
 
02:37:36.750 --> 02:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for their patients than
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
those who are not we have no information
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
whatsoever about those who are not right
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
so but what you're asking us to do is to
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
then give you authority over all of them
 
02:37:47.389 --> 02:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
when I have no indication that the ones
 
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
that are under your control are doing
 
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
better than the ones that are outside of
 
02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.269 align:start position:0%
better than the ones that are outside of
your

02:37:51.269 --> 02:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
control correct we have again we will
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
have no idea as a state about the
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
outcomes of those that we do not have a
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
contract with without granting some
 
02:38:05.070 --> 02:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
Authority so is there is there a step in
 
02:38:07.309 --> 02:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
between where we start to G to gather
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
information before we just change the
 
02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:11.870 align:start position:0%
information before we just change the
entire

02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:38:15.309 --> 02:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
system sure okay I I
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
I again we can certainly talk about that
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you gather information
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
from these programs without some level
 
02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:25.670 align:start position:0%
from these programs without some level
of

02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:38:28.349 --> 02:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh contact connection some some some
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
level regulation of what we're talking
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
about here I think again that's the very
 
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
intention of this and I I would say in
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
the absence of this data all that we
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
have are the the testimony and
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
experiences of the service providers
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
themselves and again they have they they
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
showed up throughout this process to to
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
say they desperately need this they
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
desperately want this um this is not
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
opposed by a single uh treatment or
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
recovery or Healthcare organization in
 
02:38:55.389 --> 02:38:55.399 align:start position:0%
the state that I'm aware of because they
 
02:38:57.469 --> 02:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
they think this is absolutely essential
 
02:39:00.429 --> 02:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
to ensuring the level of service across
 
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
the board thank you guys appreciate it
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative PR has a question well
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a question and a statement so to
 
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
be able to get the information you need
 
02:39:11.950 --> 02:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to need Authority given to
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
you by us so you can collect that data
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
and actually make them give you that
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
data because they're not going to give
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
it if they don't have to I would
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
assume I think that's that's very much
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
part of the intention here for sure
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
right so you need our The Authority
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
collect the data to make sure they're
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
doing what they're supposed to and
 
02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
providing a level of care to the
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
standard right I get that just wasn't
 
02:39:43.269 --> 02:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill so my um let's park this for a
 
02:39:49.630 --> 02:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
second because this is something we
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
should be will'll think about um and
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be done by 12:00 I
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
doubt but let's go to um the second bill
 
02:40:01.389 --> 02:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
that was added to this which is
 
02:40:01.399 --> 02:40:03.750 align:start position:0%
that was added to this which is
independent

02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
independent
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
question no no no
 
02:40:12.429 --> 02:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
please and follow up in the line of
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
questioning just want to go back to the
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
threat to Public Health so let me ask
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
this a little bit differently these
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
folks who are
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
treatment correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
02:40:28.190 --> 02:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
believe what I heard you say is that
 
02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
they are in Jeopardy or they are in
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
danger because we have no true oversight
 
02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
over the organizations just the
 
02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
providers and there's an inherent
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
problem in that system
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
correct that's our feeling and certainly
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
the feeling of treatment providers
 
02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
around the state for sure okay thank
 
02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
you that PP me too that's my concern and
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh my concern that's twofold number one
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
we want to protect the public number two
 
02:40:58.190 --> 02:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
the state is investing a lot of money
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
and if we are not and if we are limited
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
to the number of people that the number
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
of facilities that we can refer people
 
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
to that really impedes the progress that
 
02:41:10.429 --> 02:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
we have towards resolving this issue but
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
my other question so my question is are
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
there other states that have this type
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
of program and might you tell us a
 
02:41:20.269 --> 02:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
that um what what path they took and
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
what what the results were from there
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to be like the
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire are uniquely
 
02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
different than the people in another
 
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
state right we're all people so is there
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
do you have some some information
 
02:41:39.070 --> 02:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
there yes so I think generally substance
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
use disorder care has been largely
 
02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
unregulated throughout the nation so New
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not unique in um in having
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
some of these same challenges and there
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
are certainly states that have
 
02:41:57.469 --> 02:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
certification or licensing that are
 
02:41:59.750 --> 02:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive of outpatient care and we
 
02:42:01.389 --> 02:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
would be able to look at examples of
 
02:42:05.309 --> 02:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
that to use for R making or inciting for
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
you all to re review to figure out our
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
way forward in New
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay does any yes Senator
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
Pearl I don't actually have a question U
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be done here by
 
02:42:21.389 --> 02:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
new we all have other places we have to
 
02:42:24.429 --> 02:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
go okay then let's just hop over then to
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 27 27 sorry to rush us along
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
but we're on really tight schedule but
 
02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:31.630 align:start position:0%
but we're on really tight schedule but
well

02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes I understand so um Mr Hawkins do you
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
want to come and Hawkings come and so
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
what was
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
the so this bill was actually um amended
 
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
by the house education committee from an
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
incentive program to a grant
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
program and then it
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
was um it me me its untimely um demise
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
in the house finance committee but I
 
02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:03.830 align:start position:0%
in the house finance committee but I
think

02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:43:06.670 --> 02:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
um perhaps
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
um we can explain to the committee or
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the house can can the senate can
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
speak to why they added it and then
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
maybe U Mr Hawkins can speak to the fact
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
that this is something that's paid back
 
02:43:23.550 --> 02:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
right I'm sorry something that is I
 
02:43:25.469 --> 02:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
think this is a loan program that's paid
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
back is that right or no it is a loan
 
02:43:32.030 --> 02:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
repayment right U yeah
 
02:43:34.510 --> 02:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
okay well this was I believe Senator
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
Fenton's Bill if I'm not mistaken and
 
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to to speak to what you're
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
on education yes all right we let you
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
we'll let you take this PO okay thank
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:43:49.870 --> 02:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
so whether it's a grant that they have
 
02:43:52.110 --> 02:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
to pay back or a loan that they have to
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
pay back an incentive or a grant the
 
02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:56.309 align:start position:0%
pay back an incentive or a grant the
teacher

02:43:56.309 --> 02:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
02:43:58.510 --> 02:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
shortage committee or
 
02:44:01.230 --> 02:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
commission uh made this as a
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation that you know we know we
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of educators of teachers
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
and they and Senator Fenton filed has
 
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
been working on this for almost two
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
years to try to get this into into place
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
to support and it's primarily targeted
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the more rural District in this
 
02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
state U and it talks about you know the
 
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
rural districts in the state the size of
 
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
the schools I mean all of that is in
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
here and you know we're looking to
 
02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
resuscitate this because of its really
 
02:44:31.630 --> 02:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
its importance we know we have a
 
02:44:34.590 --> 02:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
shortage of teachers we had a commission
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
it was a committee so I don't want to
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to use those
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
interchangeably I wasn't on it but
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward shared it and former
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan was on it and this was a
 
02:44:45.550 --> 02:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
key recommendation focused on the more
 
02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
rural areas of the state so it's about
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
making an investment whether we're
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
making it as a you know offering it as a
 
02:44:55.269 --> 02:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
loan to do payback and you know through
 
02:44:58.510 --> 02:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
an incentive program or a grant did we
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
need to do something okay and so maybe
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
Finance was concerned with the money but
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know well that's your job to be
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
concerned with the money and the
 
02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation but we've got to do my
 
02:45:11.469 --> 02:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
opinion is we've got to do something
 
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is critical we know that it is and
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
we just keep kicking it down the road so
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
here's its final stop this year yeah
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so I have a question on so my
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
comment on this was with the is this
 
02:45:26.429 --> 02:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
Senate version the one that has the
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
loan as opposed to the
 
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
grant yeah because would the Senate
 
02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.190 align:start position:0%
grant yeah because would the Senate
object

02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
object
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
the this being a the house version as
 
02:45:42.670 --> 02:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to the Senate version I'm I'm
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:50.110 --> 02:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
question so this looks like it's an
 
02:45:53.429 --> 02:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
incentive see it as okay I'm sorry it's
 
02:45:55.469 --> 02:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
an incentive and we the house changed it
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
to a grant I apologize the was incentive
 
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:23.309 --> 02:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
right but there's a dollar yeah arguably
 
02:46:26.830 --> 02:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
yes so and and the budget the the
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and really this is another
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
so my thinking on this is that because
 
02:46:38.429 --> 02:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
we've put a dollar in there right and if
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
we don't fund the fund it doesn't
 
02:46:43.389 --> 02:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
happen and so this becomes a decision of
 
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal of the of the finance
 
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee and this is actually a policy
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
and the policy was passed by the
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee so I I'm in support of
 
02:47:00.429 --> 02:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
this bill this portion of it because it
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
becomes a policy then therefore needs to
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
be funded and whether or not Finance
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
funds it depends on much how much money
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
we have and that doesn't be that becomes
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
a financial issue does that make sense
 
02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:13.110 align:start position:0%
a financial issue does that make sense
to

02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
everybody are we all in agreement with
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
my and
 
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
was I was very it was a beautiful
 
02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
Soliloquy if I might add so um what I
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
was thinking was because this is really
 
02:47:34.590 --> 02:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
a policy issue this is really setting up
 
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
a program which is a policy issue and
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
education committee passed this right
 
02:47:46.389 --> 02:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
which is unusual for the house education
 
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee to pass something and that
 
02:47:50.670 --> 02:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
they agree
 
02:47:54.110 --> 02:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
on it's been a tough year in education
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
and so I think that we should all I'd
 
02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
like to honor this amend this request
 
02:48:01.630 --> 02:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
but I'd like it to be the house version
 
02:48:04.030 --> 02:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
if we could do that and then we will
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
leave it up to finance next year to put
 
02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
it in the budget and if they choose to
 
02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
put it in the budget they choose to put
 
02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
it in the budget if they choose not to
 
02:48:14.429 --> 02:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
put it in the budget it doesn't go so
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
but at least we don't impede does that
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
you no it has a dollar in there yes
 
02:48:29.269 --> 02:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
you're on the similar track to I was I
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
mean this this should be a budget year
 
02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
issue my opinion
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
yes thec but the policy could go through
 
02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
yes I don't have an issue with the
 
02:48:40.750 --> 02:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
policy I just have an issue with the
 
02:48:44.349 --> 02:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
funding that we do in off years um in
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
general I mean I'm not having an issue
 
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
with this bill but if if the house was
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
agreeable to putting the policy in and
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
leaving the funding out I I don't I'm
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
not sure that we as a senate would have
 
02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
a huge issue with that because then we
 
02:48:58.830 --> 02:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
could take it up in the budget next
 
02:49:01.150 --> 02:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
year sorry how about we make this just
 
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
two bills instead of three just calm
 
02:49:11.630 --> 02:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
wor okay so the Senate version was at a
 
02:49:16.030 --> 02:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
dollar I guess we didn't put any money
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
in no no it has always been a dollar
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
so there's no money in here we're just
 
02:49:26.030 --> 02:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:49:27.790 --> 02:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's sorry I'll give the
 
02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
dollar what's the difference between the
 
02:49:33.239 --> 02:49:35.110 align:start position:0%
dollar what's the difference between the
the

02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:49:37.309 --> 02:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
Senate theate budget and the house
 
02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
budget no the Senate version and the
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
house version the house version must
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
have had money attached to it no no no
 
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
verion turned it into a grant as opposed
 
02:49:47.950 --> 02:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
to an incentive program okay that was
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
the only difference is that correct Mr
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
Hawkings can help us here yeah I think
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
you essentially described it uh the idea
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
was the same
 
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
um the difference just being the Senate
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
policy being a a graduated loan
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
repayment the uh senates didn't
 
02:50:08.910 --> 02:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
stipulate loan it was more of a
 
02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:09.950 align:start position:0%
stipulate loan it was more of a
incentive

02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
retention um Grant same amounts and
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
everything like that um but it didn't it
 
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
didn't uh ground that into a repayment
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
of Al loan so it looked a little bit
 
02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
more like you know in hb2 this year you
 
02:50:27.389 --> 02:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
you did an incentive for a computer
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
science uh I it looked a little bit more
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
of like that I would say I mean um than
 
02:50:38.030 --> 02:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
but the idea was the same you know
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
trying to help uh retain and uh recruit
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
Educators in Rural and underserved areas
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
so so I had a long conversation with
 
02:50:49.950 --> 02:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli who's a CO
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill and his he was
 
02:50:56.469 --> 02:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
the one that amended it in he education
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
and he called it more of a grant type
 
02:51:00.229 --> 02:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
program as opposed to an incentive
 
02:51:04.229 --> 02:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
program but the concept of a policy to
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
attract teachers to underserved
 
02:51:13.469 --> 02:51:13.479 align:start position:0%
areas is similar and he he supports that
 
02:51:13.479 --> 02:51:15.429 align:start position:0%
areas is similar and he he supports that
so

02:51:15.429 --> 02:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:18.910 --> 02:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
um I just let me try to find the house
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
so if we were to give you that change
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
support the remainder of the bill as
 
02:51:27.309 --> 02:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
prate Bill 217 we would add to you
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
support the remainder of 1079 as the
 
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
Senate amended it okay so the 1079
 
02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment let me just how are we feeling
 
02:51:37.070 --> 02:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
about this is another one where we have
 
02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
no money and it's a policy issue because
 
02:51:44.429 --> 02:51:44.439 align:start position:0%
we're not this is not funded right now
 
02:51:47.389 --> 02:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
correct we're talking about sorry we're
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about s Bill
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
495 so we're going to the so what you're
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
saying is if if we agree to amend to
 
02:51:58.990 --> 02:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
take the house language of the last part
 
02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
yeah will you give us the rest of the
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes my concern
 
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
um we have three different moving Parts
 
02:52:14.469 --> 02:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
in this two of them were rejected by the
 
02:52:15.950 --> 02:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
house one of them was accepted by the
 
02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
house no one of them inance that
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
what the original bill was no that one
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
was accepted 495 with interance Stud yes
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
but the original bill was was moved out
 
02:52:31.469 --> 02:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
to pass we passed that bill right yes
 
02:52:32.990 --> 02:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
and they've also passed that Bill yes
 
02:52:36.269 --> 02:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
yes right yes we have that's and to me
 
02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's an important piece of legislation
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
I I worked very hard on that bill as
 
02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative pros and we worked to get
 
02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
that through um my concern on the 1079
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
language is first
 
02:52:51.229 --> 02:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly in the house Health and
 
02:52:52.990 --> 02:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee they moved 191
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
to interim study in my few minutes of
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
having the discussion here I feel like
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's more complicated than just a
 
02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward here's a good program
 
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
let's not that I'm opposed to the idea
 
02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
of obviously improving substance abuse
 
02:53:08.269 --> 02:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
but if we attach that and we attach this
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
to bills that the house rejected we can
 
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
agree to it here but if it goes to the
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
house and gets shot down because some
 
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
people don't like the education
 
02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
component and some people don't like um
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
substance abuse program we're going to
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
lose all of it we're not going to get
 
02:53:24.590 --> 02:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
any of it and and I'd hate to lose the
 
02:53:27.070 --> 02:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
original language and and we can't
 
02:53:29.229 --> 02:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
control that like I I have no control
 
02:53:30.429 --> 02:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
over whether or not the house is going
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
to AED to that to that language so I
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
feel like we're putting at risk an
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
important bill um when Health and Human
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
Services in the house is very committed
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
to working on 1079 to come out with
 
02:53:46.110 --> 02:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
language that will work um and I mean I
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
I actually like the education component
 
02:53:49.389 --> 02:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not oppos po the education part of
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
it at all my concern is the saying goes
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know like you need all kinds of
 
02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
reasons to vote for something you only
 
02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
need one reason to vote against it and
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just worried that we're setting up
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to the underlying bill by
 
02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
passing all of it so I'd be agreeable to
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
leaving on principle I'd be agreeable to
 
02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
leaving the the education component in
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm personally opposed to leaving
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
the middle section in on 1079 uh to the
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
point where not because once again not
 
02:54:15.550 --> 02:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
we need solutions to that problem but um
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
I'd probably need to be replaced if the
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to pass that through so
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
so the thing I would say is I I
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
understand your concern and there
 
02:54:24.349 --> 02:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be a filing period coming up in
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
six months where if this does pass that
 
02:54:29.710 --> 02:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
tweaks to it could be made relatively
 
02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
quickly within a year and so um you know
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a danger even if
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
there is some minor tweaks that need to
 
02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
be done to the middle section I think
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
that the ability is there HHS won't have
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
things in place rule making done before
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
we could actually put another bill in
 
02:54:48.070 --> 02:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
and change it you know the HHS committee
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
could certainly do that and uh that
 
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
those changes could probably occur
 
02:54:54.190 --> 02:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
before rul making ever going in the
 
02:54:56.229 --> 02:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
program was even stood
 
02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
up so if there's real concerns that
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
about some piece some element of it
 
02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity to correct it I
 
02:55:05.309 --> 02:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
don't share those concerns but if there
 
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
if there are members of the house that
 
02:55:08.190 --> 02:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
feel there are and Health and Human
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
Services wants to take that on they'd
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do so well my main
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
concern is that there appear to be a lot
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
of members of the house that hold that
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
concern and I'm just I'm just thinking
 
02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
numerically you know as as far as
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
getting something done this year well
 
02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's your selling point on the
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
floor but I just wrote your floor spee I
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
I might add I think what what was
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
attached is maybe a little bit different
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
than what actually went through Health
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
and Human Services because here it's
 
02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
only um putting the rules together it's
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
not it's not adding the the IND the
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
person in we're just putting the rule
 
02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
we're just allowing Health and Human
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
Services put the rules together we're
 
02:55:51.630 --> 02:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
not implementing the program as of yet
 
02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
well some I mean and I did have a
 
02:55:55.630 --> 02:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
confusion on this point maybe somebody
 
02:55:58.429 --> 02:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
from the Senate can help me out on it um
 
02:56:00.910 --> 02:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
let me find the page real quick sorry
 
02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
because I understand that we are putting
 
02:56:09.070 --> 02:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
was if you're concerned about maybe if
 
02:56:15.030 --> 02:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about the uh language
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
in there say if funding available we can
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
strike that and just leave the leave
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
the it's not it wasn't funding per se
 
02:56:28.229 --> 02:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
but if you look on page 14 um Roman
 
02:56:31.710 --> 02:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 it says all fees received from
 
02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
certification under this section so I'm
 
02:56:36.030 --> 02:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
assuming it's an assumption that that
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
means that that during the rul making
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
process they'll be granted the authority
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
to to Levy fees uh against the
 
02:56:44.110 --> 02:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that they're overseeing for
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
certification and it should be kept in a
 
02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund known as the substance use
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
Treatment Certification fund so we're
 
02:56:51.870 --> 02:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to allow them to
 
02:56:53.830 --> 02:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
set fees we've put no caveats to what
 
02:56:56.550 --> 02:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
those fees are um at least with oplc
 
02:57:00.229 --> 02:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's 25% above operating cost your caps
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
there's no cap here so I mean maybe we
 
02:57:04.750 --> 02:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
could do something with that but there's
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
no cap here and it's a non-aps fund with
 
02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
no cap to the non-aps fund so it's a
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
fund that money can go into with no
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
limit to it what whatsoever
 
02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
um and I not
 
02:57:21.150 --> 02:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
sure I don't see anywhere in here where
 
02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
to authorize to put a fee uh what's P
 
02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
well help me out that's what I'm saying
 
02:57:29.229 --> 02:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm confused you can page 14 Roman
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 can we bring HHS back yeah I'd
 
02:57:33.150 --> 02:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
love to yeah I just I need clarification
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
on it yeah says all fees received from
 
02:57:36.990 --> 02:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
certification under the section correct
 
02:57:39.150 --> 02:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
that is there yeah may I ask a question
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
of course I ask oh yes you may you may
 
02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
sorry does this language allow you to
 
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
assess a certification fee so I do I do
 
02:57:50.190 --> 02:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
think it would if we adopted rules on
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
this and so but until such time as we
 
02:57:53.389 --> 02:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
had the staff to implement the
 
02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
certification we wouldn't adopt the
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
rules I think if the rules are adopted
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
the fee the details of the amount of the
 
02:58:01.510 --> 02:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
fee and if there was a cap on that and
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
all of that would be worked out in the
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
rle making portion which we intend to do
 
02:58:07.309 --> 02:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
with providers so we've started that
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
process of talking with providers about
 
02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
like what would make sense we obviously
 
02:58:12.190 --> 02:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
have a big stake in the game for their
 
02:58:14.349 --> 02:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
financial viability so we need to be
 
02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
careful to not like we need to make sure
 
02:58:17.710 --> 02:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
that there is adequate treatment in our
 
02:58:19.469 --> 02:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
states so we're not looking for a fee
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
that would then put them out of business
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
right it would need to be on a scale
 
02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
based on their size and all of that as
 
02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
well um so that's some of the role
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
making that would need to be done that's
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
where all a lot of that detail happens I
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
I read through this pretty quickly I see
 
02:58:36.830 --> 02:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
no place in here where it authorizes you
 
02:58:38.670 --> 02:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
to set up a fee
 
02:58:40.750 --> 02:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
schedule maybe I'm mistaken and I'm
 
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
missing it I think it does right there
 
02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
in room making when they say they can
 
02:58:46.229 --> 02:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
set up a fee that's that's part of the
 
02:58:49.229 --> 02:58:49.239 align:start position:0%
the fee schedule is in the room making
 
02:58:50.590 --> 02:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
and we're not we're not providing any
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
oversight to that whatsoever and so I
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
understand well wait a minute we are
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
providing oversight because jel car does
 
02:58:58.110 --> 02:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
have oversight for that right so we do
 
02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
have we do and as a member of Jael car I
 
02:59:05.550 --> 02:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we are very very um
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
keen on that type
 
02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
of of of uh schedule because we deal
 
02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
with it with oplc all the time and we're
 
02:59:19.950 --> 02:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
very we are very um concerned about fee
 
02:59:22.110 --> 02:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
schedules and agency setting fees so I
 
02:59:25.309 --> 02:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
do think that would be um an area of
 
02:59:28.750 --> 02:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
concern to Jael car and the agency and
 
02:59:32.590 --> 02:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
the Jael car um Department the
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:45.429 --> 02:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
Department thank you madam chair so
 
02:59:48.269 --> 02:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
could we just add a line in in here that
 
02:59:49.870 --> 02:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
are we all in agreement that adding a
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
line about a cap on the fees or
 
02:59:55.870 --> 02:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
something to satisfy those
 
02:59:58.070 --> 02:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
concerns this is my first Committee of
 
02:59:59.830 --> 02:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
conference so I'm it's a technical
 
03:00:02.349 --> 03:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
question can we add language so so I
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
think my my concern with that is we'd
 
03:00:07.229 --> 03:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
have we'd be really just throwing a d
 
03:00:09.070 --> 03:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
we'd have no idea what to do with that I
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
i' more Trust yel car to look at it and
 
03:00:12.910 --> 03:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
assess the program correctly when they
 
03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
have the time to do so more than us
 
03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
today sitting here and deciding so could
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
we add a line about J the jail car
 
03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
process in okay so let me just explain
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
how the jail how the ru making process
 
03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
goes if the agency had the authority to
 
03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
implement this program they would work
 
03:00:31.790 --> 03:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
with their providers to put together the
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
rules and then but there would be public
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
hearings on those rules right and then
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
what and there would also be review of
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
those Rules by the administrative rule
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
department and then the comment public
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
comments and the comments from the um
 
03:00:48.750 --> 03:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
agent from the administrative Department
 
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
upward together and presented to to Jael
 
03:00:54.349 --> 03:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
car and Jael car can object they can
 
03:00:56.229 --> 03:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
express their concerns and one of the
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
things they can express their concerns
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
of is the fee so those those all that
 
03:01:04.510 --> 03:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
stuff has to be justified and has to be
 
03:01:08.150 --> 03:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
um supported by Statute right Madam
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair yes so my my concern was I mean we
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
all know the process but um referring to
 
03:01:17.309 --> 03:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
representative Simon's concerns about
 
03:01:19.830 --> 03:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
the how House the full house
 
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
understanding that that was where my
 
03:01:24.309 --> 03:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
question was could we put something in
 
03:01:26.990 --> 03:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
this language that would reassure people
 
03:01:28.990 --> 03:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
I mean we face this all the time is the
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
ignorance on the regulatory process and
 
03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
even though we understand it and that
 
03:01:35.309 --> 03:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
passing a bill doesn't give everybody
 
03:01:38.190 --> 03:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly access to run out and start
 
03:01:41.070 --> 03:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
doing we know other people don't
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
understand that regulatory process Madam
 
03:01:45.710 --> 03:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
chair yes we want a five minute caucus
 
03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely and then we'll be right
 
03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely and one of the things I do
 
03:01:50.830 --> 03:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
want to mention is that in the Health
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee
 
03:01:55.870 --> 03:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did put together an
 
03:01:58.800 --> 03:01:58.810 align:start position:0%
amendment um that was
 
03:01:58.810 --> 03:01:59.990 align:start position:0%
amendment um that was
[Music]

03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
um acceptable to the Democratic caucus
 
03:02:05.790 --> 03:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
except for one person who really didn't
 
03:02:08.910 --> 03:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
understand the fact that these that you
 
03:02:10.269 --> 03:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
could have licensed people with
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
unregistered facilities right but I
 
03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
think that's an issue that I can
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly clear up with them so we do
 
03:02:20.110 --> 03:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
have an amendment if representative
 
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
Barry wants to discuss it when you go
 
03:02:25.389 --> 03:02:25.399 align:start position:0%
back but I I just want to give you that
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
information I'm okay trying to I think
 
03:02:29.550 --> 03:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
this is important but I'm trying to keep
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
everything in balls and one in the air
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
without having one plop on the floor and
 
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:46.840 --> 03:03:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
five

03:03:16.750 --> 03:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.720 --> 03:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:46.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:46.640 --> 03:05:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:46.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:46.640 --> 03:06:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.790 --> 03:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.469 --> 03:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
I mean senator of
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
pearl you're going back to my
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
past well Madam chair we've uh We've
 
03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
caucused and we've recognized that the
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh the concern that is on the house
 
03:07:08.910 --> 03:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
floor about the underlying bill of 1079
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to make sure that gets
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
passed and give it every chance we can
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
because it's very important I guess my
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
question to you is can you provide me a
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
degree of assurance that Senate Bill 495
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
will actually have some interim study
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
work from the house HHS committee yes
 
03:07:25.910 --> 03:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
you have my word and you also have a
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
word of Representative Simon who is um
 
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
so you have a democratic word and a
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
republican word that we will push that
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
because not I do we do think it's very
 
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
important as way of reassurance one of
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
the members one of the higher ranking
 
03:07:45.550 --> 03:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I I spoke to
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
on that said that they they plan on
 
03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
doing a tremendous amount of work on
 
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
that they really do want to get it right
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
and this person would just tell me
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
straight up if they wanted to gut it and
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
kill it and just leave it off on the
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
roadside to be like no we just want this
 
03:07:59.550 --> 03:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
thing dead this person would tell me
 
03:08:01.429 --> 03:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
that uh in a private confidential
 
03:08:02.429 --> 03:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
conversation if that's what they
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually wanted because they'd want me
 
03:08:06.670 --> 03:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
to do that here um but that wasn't the
 
03:08:08.349 --> 03:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
feedback that I got just that they ran
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
out of time they really wanted to vet
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
this more closely and get it right and
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that it was done correctly and
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
that they it was a true interim study
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
not a not a soft kill well with that I
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
think that we could be yep sorry um so
 
03:08:25.710 --> 03:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
and I also spoke with um Jake and J um
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
they actually have um Jenny does have
 
03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
some homework that she has to do kind of
 
03:08:32.229 --> 03:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
in advance um working with some of the
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
providers so I told them I gave them my
 
03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
word that we would do it in stepbystep
 
03:08:40.510 --> 03:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
process not eat the apple whole at one
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
time and just start with the rules and
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
set up the program so we can work
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
together perfect keep me in mind for
 
03:08:50.349 --> 03:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
that that the Senate would be agreeable
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the original language of 1079 and the
 
03:08:55.229 --> 03:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
last portion and I'm sorry I don't have
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
the 219 217 that language being added to
 
03:09:02.269 --> 03:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
1095 and we'd be in agreement with
 
03:09:04.030 --> 03:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
removing the language that was from SP
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
sp495 from the bill okay so I just want
 
03:09:08.590 --> 03:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
to I don't want to push my luck because
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
this so far we're going well three a
 
03:09:12.269 --> 03:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so but you're talking about the
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
Senate version of Senate Bill 117 as
 
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to the house I mean 2 217 Senate
 
03:09:22.110 --> 03:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 217 the Senate version as opposed
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
to the house version I don't know that
 
03:09:26.229 --> 03:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
we have a concern one way or the other
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah because it Grant versus what if
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
you're more comfortable with the house
 
03:09:33.309 --> 03:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
version and I helps you on the floor
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
then we have to do okay let's just but
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's great so it's a house version of
 
03:09:40.389 --> 03:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
sand Bill 217 that came out of the house
 
03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
education committee and 1079 as
 
03:09:46.269 --> 03:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
submitted correct as amended by the sen
 
03:09:48.269 --> 03:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
we did that other than you know removing
 
03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
the I don't remember if we made an
 
03:09:52.630 --> 03:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to that we did not you so yes
 
03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
so the the U house version of 1079 and
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
and we'll and the house version of 217
 
03:10:03.150 --> 03:10:03.160 align:start position:0%

04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
well all right house house bill 1622 on
 
04:03:59.429 --> 04:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking and license
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
renewals etc
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
etc um we mostly agree with the Senate
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we do have a couple of
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
issues that we'd like to bring to your
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah there it's the Cannabis group
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
04:04:25.469 --> 04:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
loud uh section two has which is RSA
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
3108 Roman
 
04:04:30.429 --> 04:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
2 the language is fine but it's already
 
04:04:34.149 --> 04:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
been included in House Bill 518 as of
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
this morning so we'd like to get rid of
 
04:04:39.429 --> 04:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
this if that's agreeable with you guys I
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't mind if we do but is there any
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
issue with having it passed twice just
 
04:04:46.149 --> 04:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure we didn't make a
 
04:04:48.990 --> 04:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
mistake well if we did make a mistake it
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
would be bad because it would be random
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
chance on whether the good version or
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
the bad version came out first right but
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
no I I'm I'm fine with that I mean
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative leus I just haven't seen
 
04:05:01.550 --> 04:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
the language that's why I was hesitant
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
to remove it oh well
 
04:05:06.149 --> 04:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's I haven't seen the amendment that
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
he's drafting that was my just to make
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
sure it was correct since you will be
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
signing it off this afternoon both of
 
04:05:14.670 --> 04:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
them I have to so okay I'm fine with
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
that you have any objection to that we
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
took that exact same language and
 
04:05:19.830 --> 04:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
amended I SP
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
58 yes all right and then skipping on
 
04:05:29.309 --> 04:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
the page side by side over to
 
04:05:29.319 --> 04:05:31.590 align:start position:0%
the page side by side over to
page

04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:05:31.600 --> 04:05:33.110 align:start position:0%
page
um

04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:37.950 --> 04:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
seven there's uh the version of how the
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
the comments were to be incorporated in
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
the rule I have a draft
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
everybody that
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
um that spreads
 
04:05:56.479 --> 04:05:58.229 align:start position:0%
um that spreads
out

04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
and let us a do it explains that the
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
comments are
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
uploaded duplicate comments may be
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
Consolidated you know when you say we've
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
got you know 157 copies of this email
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
from the Sierra Club or whatever or or
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the gun
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
group there's no need to to post them
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
individually or if seven people write
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
separately that you know this rule is
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
pretty good but I don't like the fine in
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
section 12 you just
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
consolidate and then vulgar or
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate testimony may not be
 
04:06:42.189 --> 04:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
published it's just just for dis
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
discretion and
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
adds that comments received as video or
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
audio files shall be available in that
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
format they don't have to to
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
transcribe voicemail or anything like
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
that but if somebody sends them a file
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
e um I got some very nice language from
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
Jael car staff that says a report of
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
public comments received on the rule
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
shall be created the report shall
 
04:07:19.389 --> 04:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
indicate how the comment was
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the final rule the
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
comment was not incorporated into the
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
final rule the agency shall provide a
 
04:07:30.030 --> 04:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
detailed explanation that includes the
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
facts data interpretations and policy
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
choices that justify why the adopting
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
agency did not amend the rule which I
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
think is a lot clearer than either the
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
version and I that's different than what
 
04:07:49.630 --> 04:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
you had proposed here yes yeah
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's yes this was my my attempt at
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
fixing the House and Senate versions but
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
that one's much nicer it it really gets
 
04:08:23.229 --> 04:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
we would be agreeable with that okay
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
good and other than that
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
um that's all all the changes that we
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
would be requesting so essentially what
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
you want to do is use the language in
 
04:08:39.550 --> 04:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
2272 except the final section you want
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
to replace it with this yes and and
 
04:08:47.229 --> 04:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
delete section two and delete section
 
04:08:52.030 --> 04:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
two because it's a duplicate oh yes with
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
the yeah not the final sentence of that
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh no you only need to mention the
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
duplicative remarks on all right then I
 
04:09:01.680 --> 04:09:03.269 align:start position:0%
duplicative remarks on all right then I
think

04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%

04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
