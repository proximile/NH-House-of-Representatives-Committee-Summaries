00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
all right when um division one
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
held a work session on this bill on
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
march third that was before cobig 19
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
changed all of our lives and
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
significantly changed the finances of

the state of new hampshire
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
so instead of the motion that division 1
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
i move interim study and would like to
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
she is muted right now if you could ask
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
her if she
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%

of calling you making the move to us
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
yes um this bill called for a study
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee that would need to report out
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
by november 1st
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
with the covid 19 situation it doesn't
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
make sense to require
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
any more study committees the original
 
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.230 align:start position:0%
any more study committees the original
this

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill also had a fiscal note of 100 000
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
which we were going to reduce to 10 000
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
but at this time um we do know that we
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
have a large fiscal hole that is going
 
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.069 align:start position:0%
have a large fiscal hole that is going
to

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
need to be filled and funding new
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%

chair of division one said
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion on
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
um house bill 1235 the motion is
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
i tried to raise my hand oh okay
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
um representative barry has his hand up
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you madam sheriff
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
i believe a similar bill was was uh
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
contemplated a couple of sessions ago
 
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
contemplated a couple of sessions ago
and

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
the concern that i had at the time was
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we're starting to interfere with
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
i think that's a that's a
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
actually the wrong way to go and
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
by the time we get out of this pandemic
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be finding
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
considerable number of people who'd be
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
willing to have a government job and the
 
00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:36.949 align:start position:0%
willing to have a government job and the
benefits

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
so i even even interim study i think is
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
a waste of the taxpayers money thank you
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry further
 
00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:49.269 align:start position:0%

representative ober
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chairman i can't
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
concur with this for a lot of reasons we
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
did hold one work session
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
but the division was unable at the time
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
because we were not ready to take a vote
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
at all so we took
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
no vote on this bill in a work session
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and we were going to schedule
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
another work session and we all know
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
our division chairman's fault that that
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
did not happen
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of unanswered
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions about this bill
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
that we need to examine before it
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
becomes actually state
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
law right now it has
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
judicial council will pay for labs being
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
done by
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
safety we needed to bring safety in to
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
see if there were
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
grants they could get because we all
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
know they get a lot of grants if we sit
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
on fiscal you know how much money
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
safety can bring in to do some things we
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
need to know why judicial council would
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
be paying for labs that another agency
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
we were not able to get from the agency
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
a real
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
amount of finances we do that agency
 
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
amount of finances we do that agency
both

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
a favor and a disservice
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
we say to them oh gee you run out of
 
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
we say to them oh gee you run out of
money

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal and we'll give you more
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
and this particular agency has come to
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal a number of times this year
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
as we know to get additional funding but
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
that does two things
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
it gives them a crutch that they get so
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
that they don't really
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
fund we don't get real financial
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
information from
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
at the la at the last fiscal meeting
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
where they brought
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
an increase in funding i actually worked
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
with them quite a while
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
and they really didn't know how much
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
money they needed but when we went
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
through what they
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
actually needed for additional funding
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
they were willing to cut
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
their 250 000 request by a hundred
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
so we really need to work with them and
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
with a couple of other agencies before
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
this becomes law because you put it in
 
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.750 align:start position:0%
this becomes law because you put it in
law

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
you really are supposed to fund it i
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
in putting things into law and then
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
suspending which we've done
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
in hb2 a number of times and we have
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
done that
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
because in every case finance has not
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
had the money to fund that
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
we've had to make a conscious decision
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the agency as what the priorities
 
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:18.870 align:start position:0%
with the agency as what the priorities
were

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and what we would suspend so that they
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
did not get
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
a negative performance audit because
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
they weren't doing their jobs because we
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
didn't give them the funding
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
so i can't support this motion i'm not
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
going to be able to support the bill
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that we had the
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the division did not have
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
to do the thorough thoughtful
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
examination we normally do and again
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
part of our chairman in any way the
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has been suspended she was
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
willing to continue working on it
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
it just didn't happen this year thank
 
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.110 align:start position:0%
it just didn't happen this year thank
you

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ober um further
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%

00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair i don't know if we're
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to be speaking to the full bill
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
right now or just the amendment
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
um if if you wish to wait till after we
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment to talk about
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
the full bill i would do that then yes
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think we need to have a vote on the
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we'll
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%

you for the for the vote on the full
bill

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what this bill does is it
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
extends the
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
current practice of where a a
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
prisoner could request dna testing
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
there is quite a procedure they are
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
actually making a petition
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
to the superior court if they meet
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's the five criteria the
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
could then um appoint counsel for them
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it extends that
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
ability for somebody who is in prison to
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
do it to somebody who is
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
no longer in prison somebody who was out
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
on parole
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
or potentially even whose term has um
 
00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.350 align:start position:0%
or potentially even whose term has um
her

00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
sentences has expired uh
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
from the the lawyers who are involved in
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
in this sort of thing they've petitioned
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
or they've
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
asked everybody involved whether or not
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
how many cases that anybody knows about
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
the only case that that anyone could
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
come up with was one potential
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
case over the last 10 years it is not
 
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.310 align:start position:0%
case over the last 10 years it is not
expected

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
expected
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be a a drain on
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
on the judicial council but we moved it
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
off to
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh to next year to the next biennium
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
because currently the um
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
the digital council has had to come back
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
to fiscal already so in effect they have
 
00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:44.310 align:start position:0%
to fiscal already so in effect they have
already

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
spent their budget so even if there was
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
one case they theoretically could not do
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
it within their budget
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh we have always underfunded um the
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
judicial council
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
in our when we do our budget because we
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
know that they can come to
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
um to the fiscal committee uh probably
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
not a good practice but it is one that
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have been doing so this bill
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
just extends that process to somebody
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
who is
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
out on parole or whose uh sentence has
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
second set motion thank you
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative hatch seconds the motion
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
of octopass is amended
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i do see uh representative walls has
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
her hand up
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
the fundamental process that we are
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to prosecute people under in
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
this country is justice
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we know sadly that our justice
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
system has failed a number of times and
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
more recently in the last couple of
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
decades dna
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
evidence has proven over and over again
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
that our justice
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
has made mistakes and i think that this
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the foundation of our system
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
being fairness we owe it to people who
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
have been to convicted
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they believe they're innocent to
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity to have dna
 
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.789 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity to have dna
examined

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
examined
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not they were
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
unjustly convicted
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that allowing this to happen
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
furthers that end and i think it's so
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
fundamental to our very system in this
 
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
fundamental to our very system in this
country

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
i think from my point of view we have a
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
moral obligation to do it just to
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
for the foundation of our system so that
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
is why i enthusiastically had supported
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
it before and i continue to
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
because i think it is a part of
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental justice
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
that we do this thank you representative
 
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.590 align:start position:0%

representative uh rogers about this
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think when i announced it i announced

on the amendment i think i announced
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
23 to zero and i
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
think you were correct i think it was
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
22. i think i we only have 22 people so
 
00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:33.670 align:start position:0%
22. i think i we only have 22 people so
it's

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
right so it should have been so i want
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
to go back
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
that i said 23 but it should have been
 
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
that i said 23 but it should have been
22

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
to zero on the amendment and um if

there was a conversation
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner at that point in
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%

to the department of education they have
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
very many people and in some cases they
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
interfere with the local districts and
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%

thank you very much madam chair this
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
policy was
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
passed in the education department and
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
we did have
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh department of education people
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in our work session
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
the difficulty is that each
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
local school district works with
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
counselors but there's no one to oversee
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
and no one to support the counselors in
 
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.990 align:start position:0%
and no one to support the counselors in
school

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think we're going to be
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
in for a very long
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
counseling problem we've got kids that
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
are right now that
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
are concerned are upset and
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
may need support as they eventually make
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
their way back to school to a
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
physical school and i think we need to
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
support those kids and we need to
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
support the teachers
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
of those kids thank you representative
 
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.990 align:start position:0%

susan ford um but i also want to add
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think we are at a point in time like
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
we've never been in before and there are
 
00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:07.510 align:start position:0%
we've never been in before and there are
more

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
issues that students are living with
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
previously the department of ed always
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
had this position
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
in place and right now there's no one
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
that can bring
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
the uh counselors together in the states
 
00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:22.309 align:start position:0%
the uh counselors together in the states
so

00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
i really believe that um we are being um
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
true to our our mission um by
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
truly enacting such a position because
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's critical
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes thank you

um further discussion
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
we are discussing the amendment
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes i'm sorry yeah

thank you madam chair i guess i'm i'm
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
really confused
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
that we're passing a requirement that
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
somebody has to put into next year's
 
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.470 align:start position:0%
somebody has to put into next year's
budget

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
my preference would be to have somebody
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the commissioner and
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
and whoever is responsible for this and
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
let them bring it forward
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
during the budget process rather than
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
thus doing it in
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
what i consider a clutchy faction
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%

1691 as 11
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
1114 h
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i would like to present the
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and ask the committee to vote
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
no unfortunately we had our last meeting
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
on march 3rd
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
the times were much different on march
 
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.150 align:start position:0%
the times were much different on march
3rd

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
3rd
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
we would like to be able to present this
 
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.349 align:start position:0%
we would like to be able to present this
but

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill but it will cost a total of
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
about eight hundred and fifty thousand
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
dollars of the educational trust fund
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't know if we can
 
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.549 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't know if we can
pull

00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%
pull
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
851 000 out of the educational trust
 
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:55.990 align:start position:0%
851 000 out of the educational trust
fund

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
and so it becomes very difficult
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
to support that without having the full
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal knowledge of where we are
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative he seconds the motion
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%

00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative ober thank you

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.270 align:start position:0%
um may i ask representative ford a
question

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes if she's willing to take a question
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative ford i understand that
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
the division voted ought to pass as
 
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.510 align:start position:0%
the division voted ought to pass as
amended

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic you're now asking
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
us to vote no
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
is it your intention to if this is voted
 
00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:45.190 align:start position:0%
is it your intention to if this is voted
down

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
to also vote down to ought to pass and
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
then to vote
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
refer for interim study or itl
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the clarification
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't want to
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
start that but but that's exactly where
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
we are now and i think it's very
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but i also think it's
 
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.470 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but i also think it's
necessary

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i have talked to all of the division
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
um two committee members so we
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
know um they were in agreement that this
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
is where we are it's just
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
any i see no further hands up
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
and so i will ask representative rogers
 
00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:26.470 align:start position:0%
and so i will ask representative rogers
to

this very often
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have situations we use very
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
often thank god
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank goodness thank goodness um
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
unless other hands up yes uh
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative barry has to stand up
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
yes are we are we making it not to pass
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
motion so we can practice saying no
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's exactly what we're doing
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that for me
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
if the this goes down i will bring forth
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
in motion of itl
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh so why i think we have to
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
i think this has to fail before we go to
 
00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:09.990 align:start position:0%
i think this has to fail before we go to
itl

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
right is that correct yes
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
so this is just we're going through the
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
out of going through the recommendations
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
that came
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
out of the um division trying to make me
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
do more work
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to make it work yes
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's up to how the committee wants to
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
proceed if they want to just
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
not make the otp motion and just make
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're able to do that as well but i'll
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
leave that up to you
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
because madam chairman haven't we voted
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
down the recommendation when we voted
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment because the recommendation
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
was ought to pass as amended
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
and the chair of division two asked us
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
to vote no which we did
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
so that recommendation is really gone
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to bring forth the motion
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity to provide equal
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
access and opportunity for students with
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities to participate in
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities this came out
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
of division
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
two with the five to one in expedient to
 
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.750 align:start position:0%
two with the five to one in expedient to
legislate

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
it is not that we are against the policy
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
the policy is a wonderful idea
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to see more and more kids
 
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.230 align:start position:0%
i would like to see more and more kids
participate

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
but it's a fifty thousand dollar amount
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the board that the department of
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
education would keep in reserve
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
and um there is no way of knowing how
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
each individual district would would
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
get to this money the department of ed
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
did tell us that if they were to take
 
00:57:49.839 --> 00:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
did tell us that if they were to take
this

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
and to develop the standards
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
um it would cost that would take
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars out of the bill so
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
then they'd have forty thousand dollars
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
what we suggested was that um
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
who we we appreciate and we really want
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
involved with this take a look at this
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
um just broaden the plan so that people
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
would know
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
exactly how they could access this money
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
and how
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
how this money would be spent there is
 
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.430 align:start position:0%
how this money would be spent there is
also

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
um this is also eligible for for 94142
 
00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.549 align:start position:0%
um this is also eligible for for 94142
funding

00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
and there may be a grant and maybe an
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
the department of education to support
 
00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:39.510 align:start position:0%
the department of education to support
this

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%

commerce committee
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
after it went to human services
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
and then us after they vetted it because
 
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:38.950 align:start position:0%
and then us after they vetted it because
this

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
pharmacies isn't really our bailiwick
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
is that um there there was an
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
idea that maybe there would be an
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
amendment brought in
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
to change the 100 000 appropriation
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
to one dollar um i've spoken to the
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors many times
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
and uh felt that that
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
was sort of unnecessary because
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
obviously we have no knowledge
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
of how that would ever happen and
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the looming possibilities of a
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
great deficit
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
especially in health and human services
 
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
especially in health and human services
uh

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
i thought it was unwise and i think
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's been the agreement of division
 
01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:28.789 align:start position:0%
there's been the agreement of division
three

01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
that we should itl this bill
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
and then i told the sponsors if they
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
still feel strongly and we know what our
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
financial situation is they should
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
resubmit the bill
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh hennessey would you
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes i just wanted
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
to add that there
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
when we were discussing this in division
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of questions around the
 
01:03:57.359 --> 01:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of questions around the
insurance

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%

what representative norgren said we
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
really felt like there was a lot of
 
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.349 align:start position:0%
really felt like there was a lot of
policies

01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
decisions that still need to be made and
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
this would have been better off going to
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
commerce first
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%

just to explain to the committee uh
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
although division three originally
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommended hb 1638 ought to pass as
 
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
recommended hb 1638 ought to pass as
amended

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
um in early march it is a very different
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
time today as we've all discussed
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
two and a half months later uh this bill
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal note of between 150
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
000 to 300 000 and we know
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
that given the current fiscal situation
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
there are no additional funds to
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the department
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
that said though since within division
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
three there was strong
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support to ensure that more
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
of our new hampshire snap participants
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
benefit from healthier eating and access
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
more local produce
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
