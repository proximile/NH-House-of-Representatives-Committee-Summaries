house um I want to you know thank the
 
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and the acting chairman the
 
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um for uh having me here to
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
talk about this I uh I realize that uh
 
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
I've given this in front of a few of you
 
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
before you probably recognize some of
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
the wording in fact some of you have
 
00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
heard it so much you probably could say
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
it from from heart instead of me saying
 
00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 align:start position:0%
it right now but um I think it's very
 
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
important uh for the uh for the people
 
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um that regular
 
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
citizens and also the the businesses uh
 
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
that are affected by this because of the
 
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
way it affects the the potentially
 
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
affects the tax rate but uh more plainly
 
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh requires the state to
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
pay 7 a half% of political subdivision
 
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
employer pension contributions on behalf
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
of teachers
 
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
police officers and
 
00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
firefighters many of you know the
 
00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 align:start position:0%
history of the State uh reneging on its
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
promise to fund a portion of the
 
00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
retirement system Others May testify in
 
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
more detail in the history uh but a few
 
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
of the the low points are as follows in
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh 1967 the state encouraged political
 
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to join the Statewide
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
retirement system for teachers police
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
and firefighters and said it and enticed
 
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
them by saying they
 
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
40% in uh 1977 the state reduced its
 
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
contribution uh to
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
35% 2009 it was a complicated year
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see the three references there
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
but it finally finally went down uh to
 
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
um restored a uh State contribution of
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh 35% but then again a uh an
 
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 align:start position:0%
amendment was put in and that was
 
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated and went back to it went to
 
00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 align:start position:0%
zero at that point you know more
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
2022 uh there was a bill that we put in
 
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
and uh it was effectively uh changed uh
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
to one year only I say effectively
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
because it was fairly complicated
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
situation where there being a a uh a
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill also involved um and again
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
cities towns and schools were asked to
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
join the state retirement system with a
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
promise that the state would help defay
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
the employer costs when New Hampshire
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
retirement syst system was formed in
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
1967 replacing four smaller separate
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems the state contributed
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
40% of the total employer
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
costs the 75% contribution in this bill
 
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.189 align:start position:0%
costs the 75% contribution in this bill
HB

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
14 uh excuse me from uh 1417 was for one
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
year only and they actually did the uh
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're able to do it you know went
 
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
through the system and they were able to
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
to pay that for that in that one year um
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
census State riged on its promise the
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions have had to pay
 
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
for the state share of the employer cost
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
much of which is was downshifted to
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
Municipal and local property taxes the
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
tax rates please consider voting ought
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
to pass on
 
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.990 align:start position:0%
to pass on
HB

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
197 to partially reinstate the promise
 
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the state to the political
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions it would provide much
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
needed relief to political subdivisions
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
and help offset the the need for
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
increased property
 
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
taxes hp1 197 helps the average taxpayer
 
00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also because again businesses
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
especially small businesses pay uh pay
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
also so um you know some uh in addition
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
I know it's in the past has been said
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
well it's up to the cities and towns to
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
determine what they need um and then
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
they they should pay for it if they need
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
police and fire and the amount of it
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
then then they then they pay for it but
 
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many people sitting
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
there figure that their towns say they
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
need less
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
police many any the towns think they
 
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
need less
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
firemen less emergency
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
services or and again with the
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
complicated nature of Public public
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
education and all of the uh additional
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
things with u taking care of U special
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
students uh do we really need need uh
 
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
you know less support for for them um
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
especially with some of the rigorous
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that they're you know that
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
are getting more and more uh placed on
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
them so uh I hope you really consider
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
this this bill and and thank you for the
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to talk to you about
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative AER any
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative papich mull
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative for testifying and taking
 
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
representative for testifying and taking
questions

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
you've already brought up the fact that
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
the um costs incurred are controlled by
 
00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
the you know municipalities by the
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions if this bill
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
passes will they have more or less of an
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
incentive to keep those costs
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
down well the cost will still be there
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
they just won't be paying for it all the
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
state will be paying for some of
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
it if I may quick followup yes one just
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
one I obviously understand that the
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
shift changes in terms of who pays will
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
that change in who pays for part of the
 
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill increase or reduce the incentive
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
for the local governments to be careful
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
about increasing
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
costs okay uh increasing cost relative
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
to relative to say what they are
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
expending today when they hire a new
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
firefighter does the fact that the state
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
would now be responsible for part of the
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
costs increase or decrease their odds of
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
hiring them or paying them more I don't
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
think it would uh make it so that they
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hire them right now they can't
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
hire the ones they want there's not
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
enough firemen around there's not enough
 
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.389 align:start position:0%
enough firemen around there's not enough
policemen

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
policemen
 
00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.509 align:start position:0%
policemen
around

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
so uh other
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes uh representative Daniels
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the purpose of the
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
to in the purpose of the bill it stated
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
that uh in part to enhance public
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
education can you tell me which metric
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
will be used to determine that public
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
enhanced I uh I guess I have to see
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
which which reference that is but uh
 
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
public education um it would make it so
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
that it would be easier uh maybe take a
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of pressure off of uh you
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
know the school systems with all the
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
money that that they have to expend
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
overall that they have you know we all
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
know they have very large budgets and
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
they have really big needs between
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
transportation and everything else so
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not really sure what else what
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
else to say may you can follow up okay
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you I don't see any
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
other hands so thank you very much
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative AER thank you very much
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you Mr chairman members
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
state representative John cluder from
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County district 6 which
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
comprises the communities of Claremont
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
and Cen and I'm here today as a
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and in strong support of
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 197 first of all I want to
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
commend the prime sponsor representative
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
Edgar for again introducing this bill
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a cause which I think is
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
important and I frankly got involved
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
with spon co-sponsoring this legislation
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
I also worked with the late
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative renie kushen on this when
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
I went to a meeting of the Claremont
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
city council probably 10 eight 10 years
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
ago and this city council and our city
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
council sits on a on a PO well a a deis
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
a raised deis so if you come and testify
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
you sort of got to look up a little bit
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
and they went after me on claremont's
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
high property taxes in the time we had I
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
think the distinction of being the
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
community with the highest property tax
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
rate this is I think actually 2014 it's
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
a little lower now but I think we're
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
still in the top 10 of communities and
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
they said and by the way these City
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
counselors they're Democrats Republicans
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
Independents it it's not a real partisan
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
they were complaining to me about what
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
the state did the 2010 through 2014 all
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
the downshifting and all you know
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
actually going back to 2008 you know the
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
two you know 2009 session so there is
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
not uh I don't want to be sound too
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
partisan on this because we we had faed
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
some challenges but they were
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
complaining to me about the downshifting
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
and they com complained that was the the
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
biggest downshifting they had ever
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
experienced as elected officials and
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
citizens a lot of these people had been
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
in lived in Claremont a long time and
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're dedicated citizens by the way
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
our city councilors don't get paid
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
anything they do it because they love
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
their Community but they were struggling
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
to to put together a municipal budget uh
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
and I know they our school board the
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
same thing but I believe this would
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
would it's a modest bill it does not
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
return it to way it was I there a part
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
of me wish we could go back to the thir
 
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:27.590 align:start position:0%
of me wish we could go back to the thir
30

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
35% this is a modest
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
72% and I realize some people said well
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns are going to learn
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
to live with less of a contribution from
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
the state but In fairness they were
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
encouraged to join the retirement system
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
in 1967 that's when I was 10 years old
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
and we're just starting to fact that's
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
the year first year I first came to the
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
State House on as a fourth grader but
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
they were encouraged to join the
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system and now you know and
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we had to do it as legislators
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
because of the Great Recession and the
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
lack of Revenue and we have to balance
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
our budget obviously according to house
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
rules but I think we should have
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
returned in 2012 to what we had before
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
because it's really hurting our
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
communities Claremont cin and and and
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
especially the area I represent but I
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people are complaining
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
about even the city of Lebanon which I
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
think is is in great shape and I hope
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not anybody from Lebanon when they
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
start complaining I think we ought to
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
sit up and take notice uh so this is a
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
modest bill but I think I urge you to
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
pass this bill in its present form of of
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
at least seven and a half% and give us a
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of a break and to the
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
question of earlier whether it's going
 
00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
to encourage communities to become spend
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
thrifts and hire the high highest paying
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
police off I know in my community it'll
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
just re provide a little bit of relief
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not I don't think they're going
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
to go on wild spending spree and we have
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
in fact two other members of the house
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
this term are members of city council
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
and they can I'm sure testify they're
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
not here today the the the tightness of
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
our our city budget our school budget
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
it's a constant Challenge and as the
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar lud we have a labor
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
shortage it's hard enough to to hire
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
police officers firefighters teachers so
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have to struggle
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
but this bill will give our
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities our school district and
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
our counties and all of you are members
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
of County delegations and I know as
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
chair a few years ago we had to struggle
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
we had to re build a new nursing home or
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
renovated excuse me and the we had to
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
struggle and we got some aid from the
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
state through arpa but still we had to
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
bond it and it's going to be a direct
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
impact on the property taxpayers so I I
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if I can answer a lot
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
of technical questions but I urge you to
 
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
please pass this bill and get it to the
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
floor at least we can have a debate uh I
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
think it's it's it's it's a matter of
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
fairness for our our community
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:10.839 align:start position:0%
can't afford to live here they are they
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
are moving out it's and we really really
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
need it's pitting towns against each
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
other it's pitting people because we are
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
in the kiage district and we are seven
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
Town school so you've got towns after
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
each other it's it's not it's not very
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%

nurse and um they go after the teachers
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
you make too much well the teachers need
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
to have a salary to live also and um
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
future of our Our Town our children and
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
we need the prices are just too high
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's pricing everybody out of out of out
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the state almost not just the town
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%

coming in and uh speaking with us um
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
earlier one of my uh colleagues um asked
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
how um this bill would enhance public
 
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
how um this bill would enhance public
education

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you might be uh able to
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
well it it would
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
help it would help with the cost it
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
would help with teachers coming
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
in um you can't find enough people
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
police fire I mean we have a vol fire
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
alone let's say and that's part of
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
Education that helps with
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
everything um we were asked well do we
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
need any more firemen can they wear each
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
other's equipment I mean that's how bad
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
it's gotten yeah I'm not kidding you
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
they've asked the highway department
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
well if it's a snowy
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
day and you know it's going to snow you
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
stay home the day before so when you
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
come in for a snowstorm you don't get
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
overtime education is the same way do
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
you need Paras and special education is
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
is a high cost for the school systems
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
mandated and a lot of people don't
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand what that costs well why did
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
they need help maybe they all ought to
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
go into these classrooms my husband
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
taught special ed in Manchester for 30
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
years I have a son that teaches a
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
son-in-law that teaches up in uh Warner
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
Special Ed I mean they put their money
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
into things people don't understand what
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
teach is putting in if they're they care
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
students um there's more or more
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
problems in the school like my daughter
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
is a school
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
more problems for the kids psychological
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
everything else and that's it would all
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
help with that maybe it's not much but
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a start I mean to not do
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
anything to do something is better than
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you I'll just point out to
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ms um if you look at the
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note 2third of the cost of this
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
bill is related to School Employees as
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to municipals representative
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
Papo V Müller has a question thank you
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and again thank you for uh
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
testifying and for being willing to take
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
questions you were describing how the
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
lack of State support is pitting Town
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
residents against each other because of
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
concern for high costs mhm those costs
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
would not change under this all we
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
change is the pocket that the money
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
comes from money would be paid from the
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
state but the
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
state because the state pays for
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
everything then you'd also be
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying the state share
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
for every other community so essentially
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about which way does
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
the state reach into your pockets to pay
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
for this can you help me understand why
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
in your opinion this bill would decrease
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
that type of uh stress in the town it
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
helps with the taxes from the school s
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
when we are going right now we're going
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
through budgets and they're cutting the
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
high CU a comes from the state we have
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
police we have fire each town has
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
teaches each town has the
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
schools so it does help at least it
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
gives people that the state is doing
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
something because right now the people
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't feel the state is doing anything
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative tillers thank you
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
question and I don't want to put you on
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
the spot but I'm just curious if you
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
have an idea um if this bill were to
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
pass what the town of Bradford would
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
receive for that 7 half% from your
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
retirement payment and if
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
so if you could equate it to some to
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
Cuts you've made that were equivalent
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
choices well one is um 200 ,000 for the
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
roads every year that puts you back as a
 
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
roads every year that puts you back as a
town

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
um that money would come in to help
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
reduce at least it would make the towns
 
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.630 align:start position:0%
reduce at least it would make the towns
people

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
feel it's not a lot but it's a help that
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
they're at least thinking of the people
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
that live here and work here or have
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
lived here all their
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
lives it it
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
if nothing else it's Goodwill to know
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
that your legislators are working for
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
you and don't care because this is what
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's like I mean we had a school meeting
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
where people wanted to cut $10,000 from
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
budget and 16 almost 1600 people showed
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
up to support the schools it shouldn't
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
have to get that bad that we have to do
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss frer and we have next uh
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
Association good morning thank you my
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
name is Margaret Burns and I'm here
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
Association in strong support of house
 
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.390 align:start position:0%
Association in strong support of house
build

00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
197 restoration of a state retirement
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
contribution has been a longstanding
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
policy of the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
Association which represents all
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
234 cities and towns in the state of New
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are grateful for the
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
continued legislative efforts to attempt
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
to restore some level of State
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
contribution to those costs for
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think that the history
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system the cuts in the
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
contributions has been well laid out
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
already so I will not Bel labor those
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
points here this morning we do
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
understand that this budgeting process
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
will be a challenging one however I wish
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
to remind the committee that in past
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
years the legislature has seen fit to
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
recommit to promises made to local
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
governments with respect to funding in
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
2021 the legislature increased the
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipal meals and rooms tax
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
distribution to 30% and several years
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
ago the legislature did provide one-time
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
funding equal to 7.5 % of the municipal
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
employer contributions while those
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation were not full
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
restoration of Prior promises made they
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
showed a recommitment by the legislature
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
to local governments and their budgets
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
and they also significantly assisted
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities with budget crunches and
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
property tax relief by providing those
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
forms of relief this bill does the same
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
thing it would not be a full restoration
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the amount originally promised to
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities when they were enticed to
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
join the retirement system but it would
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
be a step in the right direction and it
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
would recommit and show that the state
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
budget and budgets decisions made at the
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
state level are in fact inextricably
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
intertwined with Municipal budgets and
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
Municipal property taxes we have heard
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
the argument that municipalities have
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
control over their employer costs for
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
the retirement system because they make
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
decisions about compensation as well as
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
hiring decisions in general however I
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
wish to share that the majority of the
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
costs that municipalities pay in their
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
retirement contribution is in fact the
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability on the system about
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
75% of what municipalities pay
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
represents the unfunded liability on the
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
system and the unfunded liability is a
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
result of decisions that were not made
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
by local government employers and over
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
which they have no control additional
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
the rising cost of retirement coupled
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
with Rising costs of benefits and other
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
things that go along with having
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
employees and hiring employees all
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
present a serious crunch on Municipal
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
budgets that do lead to lower
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
compensation or not hiring and not
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
filling positions that are otherwise
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
needed in the
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
municipality any state contribution to
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities is property tax relief
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
because it offsets local budgets and
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
local expenses
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
I've also submitted a letter by email to
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
the committee I appreciate your time
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
this morning and I encourage the
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee to vote a to pass on this
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation thank you
 
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.190 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation thank you
very

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
much um thank you Miss Burns I'm I'm
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
just going to ask a question you said
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
75% of costs I assume you mean of
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
employer costs corre rather than total
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
contribution yes yes thank you Mr
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
chairman other questions from the
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative Daniels thank
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh we have heard uh
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that in ' 67 the state
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
encouraged the political subdivisions to
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
become part of the Retirement System
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
since then has that has that been
 
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
changed to a requirement are towns
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
required to be part of the retirement
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
system in a sense yes because police
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
teacher and fires are teacher and fire
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
are required to be part of the system so
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
yes they are
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
additionally even for the group one
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
employees who are volunt who mun IP
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
alties made decisions about whether to
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
include in the system um and of which
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
most municipalities have made that
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
decision to include the employees in the
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
system in order to leave the system the
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
municipality would have to pay their
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
share of the unfunded liability which is
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
typically prohibitive so in a sense even
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
group they are they are required to be
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
part of the system unless there's a
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
willingness to appropriate that money to
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
pay the unfunded liability okay thank
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ms thank you Mr
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for taking my
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm glad that you um you
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
you highlighted
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
um the uh unfunded liability and uh the
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
fact that um towns really didn't have
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
much input into what drove that could
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
you provide just a little bit more
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
detail in terms of what are some of the
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
things that the state did um to
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
artificially uh reduce the liability in
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
the past that we're now paying the cost
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
for there have been uh there's been
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
legislation passed to change benefits
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
over the years um that has that has
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
increased costs although the state did
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
make some serious changes around 2011 um
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
as a result to try to reduce some of
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
those costs but decisions with respect
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
to investment and management of the
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
funds none of that is municipally
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
controlled and some of that has had an
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
impact on the rates and the costs for uh
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
both the state as an employer and
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other local
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
governments as
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
employers follow uh thank you um wasn't
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
there also um legislative action taken
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
to um reduce the discount rate or or
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
increase the discount rate whichever one
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
increases the
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
liability get remember there have been a
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
variety of legislative actions that have
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
in fact increased the unfunded liability
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
theost thank you thank
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you oh okay representative
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
seaworth and followed by representative
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
Papa vich Müller and that will be the
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
last for
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chairman given the
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
focus on the unfunded liability do you
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
think it would as a matter of policy it
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be effective for the state to
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
attempt to address that and relatively
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
speaking given the limited ability to
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
find funding is that a more effective or
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
less effective solution than um
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
offsetting payments from the towns that
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
that is a great uh great question nh's
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
policy long-standing policy is to
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
restore some level of State contribution
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
um to municipalities that being said we
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
have supported in the past efforts by
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
the state to pay down the unfunded
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
liability the state is on track um with
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
its plan establish lished many years ago
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
to pay down the unfunded liability by I
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
believe 2039 so the state is on track to
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
do that um but yes there have been
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts to try to uh really
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
Target the unfunded liability as another
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
way of reducing costs that we have been
 
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.350 align:start position:0%
way of reducing costs that we have been
supportive

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
of thank you um representative Papa V
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
mull thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
for testifying and for taking questions
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
just I would appreciate if you'd help me
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
reconcile two parts of your testimony
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
one part was that you were saying that
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of the state support
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh towns have to offer lower
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
compensation or even pass on hiring
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
decisions because they cannot afford to
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
pay those people and then you said that
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
passing this would bring property tax
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
relief but if the problem that we are
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
solving is that the compensation is too
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
low and they cannot hire wouldn't that
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
mean that they would be paying people
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
more and hiring more people how does
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
that work with the property tax relief
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
part I would appreciate your thoughts
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
yes I I really appreciate the question
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we talk about property
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
tax relief there's an assumption that it
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
means that property taxes will be
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
reduced that that's what property tax
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
relief has to mean and I I understand
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
the perspective however any additional
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
Aid or Revenue that comes to a
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
municipality that offsets expenses that
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
the municipality already has or that
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
offsets existing expenses and therefore
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
allows municipalities to invest in other
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
things that their constituents want them
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
to is property tax relief um and
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
that that is the fact thank you sir
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming Miss Burns thank
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
vone and I don't see uh which city or
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm Mark Fone I
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
represent the town of eping and I'm here
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
to briefly speak in favor of this
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
bill let me just put it in very granular
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
terms if this bill passes um the school
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
$781,000

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
$781,000
 
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.269 align:start position:0%
$781,000
next

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
year we have on the district warrant a
 
00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:31.870 align:start position:0%
year we have on the district warrant a
teacher

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
$400,000 so the net impact on the T on
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
the town tax rate the school tax rate
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
would be actually a negative um if you
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
save 781 th000 and you're only spending
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
an extra 400,000 you still have a a net
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
saving of
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
300,000 another way to put
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
it if this doesn't
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
pass and the teacher contract passes the
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
tax rate goes up 40 cents on the
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
thousand now there's a lot of talk about
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
trying to keep taxes down and a good way
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
to do that is to vote down the teacher
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
contract that
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
happened last time we had a teacher
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
contract actually two rounds ago and
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
guess what happened in eping teachers
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
left and guess where they went to they
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
didn't just leave the state they went to
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
districts where they paid more
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
money so that's the reality here so if
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
districts like eing want to keep
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
teachers in one place and guess what the
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
quality of Education depends on stable
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce if you're constantly churning
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
staff then you are constantly retraining
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
you are constantly trying to get a a
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
quality out of workers who may not be
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
there the next year so long story short
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
pass this bill please so that eping
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
can have a good incentive for passing a
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
teacher contract so that we can keep
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative any
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%

in the past and and those bills have
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
been successful in making the
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations necessary to pay down the
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
delayed and deferred Waste Water Project
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
list also other individual bills have
 
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.710 align:start position:0%
list also other individual bills have
been

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated have appropriated state aid
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
grant to
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have completed
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
expensive Wastewater projects
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
ideally level funding this program in
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
each budget and assuring that the
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations on non-aps would reassure
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities when issuing the debt
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
they need to build these expensive
 
00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:43.470 align:start position:0%
they need to build these expensive
Wastewater

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
Wastewater
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
projects level funding this program
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
would also go a long way towards um the
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
governor's priority of partnering with
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
local communities to expand the state's
 
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.349 align:start position:0%
local communities to expand the state's
housing

00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
the main the main thing here is even
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
though these these bills have been
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
introduced several times they they still
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
need to be introduced each budget
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
because they have to remind people that
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
they that um what they do and that they
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
funded and I at that at this point I
 
00:37:21.319 --> 00:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
funded and I at that at this point I
take

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um representative
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
can you remind us what happened to this
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
Bill last time was it was the money
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
already in the budget from the governor
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
or I don't remember I'm
 
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.030 align:start position:0%
or I don't remember I'm
sorry

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
um the money was in the previous
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
budget but it has to be re re
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated every time
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
so level funding this this program would
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
be much better than having to bring
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
these bills in SE separate individual
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
bills for each
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
list and that that's what this that's
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
what the 15 million is for to to to
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
bring that to a level funding each
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
year thank you questions yes
 
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.470 align:start position:0%
year thank you questions yes
representative

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
you representative for being here you
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
are missed on this row here on finance
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you your bill um I recall it
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
before and I'm just wondering in terms
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
of specifics of spending is there a
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
priority list is there a requirement
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
list is there projects that are um fall
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
under a certain criteria that would be
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
in line first to receive this amount of
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
money and how would that work thank
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you representative um that
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
goes through Dees and they have they
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a priority list and um so when so
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
when they um approve approve Pro
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
projects and they and they um the the
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities begin the projects they
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
actually have to complete the projects
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
before they before theyve appropriated
 
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.710 align:start position:0%
before they before theyve appropriated
any

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
funding is that you come close to
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
answering your question that's fine
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
rung thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um if this bill
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
were to pass would that also serve to
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
offset property taxes by providing state
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
revenue that otherwise the towns would
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the municipalities would have to
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
pick up right well the M yes the
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to have to cover the
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
cost so they either have they what they
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
end up they usually um issue bonds and
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
issue debt
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
so mun so um that that's that would have
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
to be covered
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
the questions yes representative M thank
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you uh for taking
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
my question um as as as a newb on the
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
committee please bear with me if i u I'm
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
asking questions that everybody else
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
understands um the bill references RSA
 
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.790 align:start position:0%
understands um the bill references RSA
uh

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
486 and there are two sections in that
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
RSA um 4861 which deals with State
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
contributions in a 4863 which deals with
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
alternate State contributions and the
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
and the second section I mean
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
4863 specifically mention seven towns uh
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
projects in seven towns of which one is
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
Hampton and since I represent Hampton
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
that immediately caught my attention um
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
so is will this money be
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
used will this be money used will this
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
money be allocated specifically to those
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
seven towns or to new project project in
 
00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:59.390 align:start position:0%
seven towns or to new project project in
other

00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
towns uh I don't believe so I believe
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
that what we're trying to do here is um
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
fund the program fund the state aid
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
grant program so that
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities know that the funding is
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
there but right when the funding is not
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
there they don't issue the debt and they
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
don't build the projects and and um I
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
there were no really specific specifics
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative

housing yeah problem in this state and
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
especially with towns that do not have a
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
public water and sewer
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh infrastructure in
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%

um
so

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
um what's what is restricting some of
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the in some places the housing is is the
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
septic system it has to be it has to be
 
00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
septic system it has to be it has to be
more

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
um spread out and when I heard the
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
governor's speech she was she mentioned
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the local communities is the way
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
um that's that's how the housing program
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
got put into this bill it was
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
it before before um
 
00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:01.829 align:start position:0%
it before before um
that

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
um didn't used to mention um housing
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
but the you can't you can't expand the
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
housing program if you don't have septic
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%

on that side of the room or this side of
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
the room and and if you're on this side
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
of the room you can participate and ask
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
questions just like everybody else if
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're on that side of the room you
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
could testify just like everybody
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
testifying you can only do one or the
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%

many years many recent years I'd like to
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
start up a test testimony Oh by by the
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
way I represent lore Bartlet water
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%

affiliated with national Rural
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
Water the essence of this bill um
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
historically is is it unites federal
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
grants with a state aid grant program
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
and makes it possible for municipalities
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
across the breadth of the state to fund
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
large wastewater treatment
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
projects um this bill if we found
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
through the years and I've been involved
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
since the creation of this bill that
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
came out of Representative Allard out of
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
Conway in
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
1992 and believe it or not I've been
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
involved since then um I've been working
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
with representative buo for 20 years on
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
this issue and every year we have to
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
come in and try to bring the new legis
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
legislation up to speed as to what this
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
program really accomplishes right now at
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
15 million a year it takes away those he
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
requirements and those low requirements
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
of up and down it flat lines at at a 15
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
million a year 15 million a year from
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
the state general fund leverages right
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
now $600 Million worth of completed
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure with Bond payments
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 20 to 30 years depending
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the 20 years is usually U State
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund which EPA money
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
coming through the Department of
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services the 30 year is
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
Rural Development Association money that
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
comes a rural development uh utility
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
program that comes through the uh
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
Farmers Bill the farm bill so it's
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal money coming into the
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
state uh rural development comes in
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
through Vermont uh they manage both
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
States and the allocation to New
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is $12 million a year and
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
every time they take some of that 12
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
million and use it for for Grants it
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
reduces on on a ratio basis the amount
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
of principle they can use so $12 million
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
a year through the national formula
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
isn't really enough in New Hampshire so
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
we fight from the local level to get our
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
US senators and congressmen to bring
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
more money into New Hampshire through
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
Reserve monies and we've been
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
able the cycle ends in in April we've
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
been able to go in August in the
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
National Reser called a pool money
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
territories and states that head the
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
allocation but didn't use it and we tap
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
into that and flow it back soon Vermont
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire so that's an ongoing
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
process too um now I know what you're
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
faced with because this program is faced
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
with 2008 recession when they didn't pay
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
any on this program for a number of
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
years and this in the towns still were
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay so they had to pay the
 
00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:52.109 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay so they had to pay the
states

00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
portion recently and I like I would like
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
to remind you that recently this this
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
this uh panel here this this committee
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
spearheaded the idea of understanding
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
the program more and in the trailer bill
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
they clarified that this is not the de
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
money this is money passing from the
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
federal government through the
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
through the EPA to make the payments on
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
this um so when a governor asks agencies
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
to cut back a certain percentages
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
historically that's occurred uh in the
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
past the agency took credit for cutting
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
some of this program and the trailer
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
Bill said no this is pass through money
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
not to be part of an agency CAU credit
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
credited to a Governor's directive uh so
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
they're kind of prioritized what this
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
money is about um and then and then they
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have been fighting through many
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
years to get that list uh representative
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
priest there's a list of all the
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
projects that had been completed
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
and after the projects are final finally
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
completed and passed on to the the DS
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
for certification of payment he has to
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
wait one year for the warranty to go out
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
so even after final comp completion a
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
project has one year before it's
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
certified to go to governor councel for
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
the actual contract to payment the list
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
that comes before you through the
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
through hb1 every year the governor's
 
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
budget coming from the agency is called
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
the maintenance budget and that's that's
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
all they put in historically and that's
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
what's in there this year this bill says
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
beyond the maintenance budget and you'll
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
see that in the layout of the monies is
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
is the need to fund it at at 15 million
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
that adds enough more so you've got
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
you're back to that level funding that
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
we need to to uh to have in order for
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities when they vote their
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
bonds quite often in on towns by 2/3
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes in precincts by simple
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
majority because their chatter created
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
by the legislature as a subgovernment
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
entity of the state not of the town but
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
of the state gives them the right to
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
pass bonds by just a simple majority so
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of difference of
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
the challenge of taking that debt on
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
nobody can force those municipalities to
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
pass the bonds we hear all about home
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
rule and and where the power is the
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
federal government the state government
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
cannot force municipalities pass a bond
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
is in the state's interest for them to
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
pass the bonds on water because
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
everything you do now especially housing
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
hinges in the health of the communities
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
the economic viability of communities
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
hinges on clean drinking water and the
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
protection of that drinking water so
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
when you look at the general budget the
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
best place to put your money first when
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
you prioritize any budget is building
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure of Water waste water
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
that this state needs for and its
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
communities need when this money is
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
there and those people go to vote you
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
say this money is there it helps them
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
understand and pass the votes needed if
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
you want to if we all have to work
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
together just as expeditiously as we can
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
with everything behind this in order to
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
make it happen because it takes years to
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
design it to put it out to bid to build
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
it a Year's warranty and then it goes to
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
Governor C covor if it's certified and
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
all the oversight of that Ty process of
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
design and build all of the law in 486
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
says the dees has to has to oversee even
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
the design has to has to approve it to
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
go out to bid has to approve every uh
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
invoice has to uh uh authorize final
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
completion has to give up retainage and
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
then finally has to have all that
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
information come back to him so they can
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
certify it for payment quite a process
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
at the local
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
level funding at at $15 million a year
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
makes the program solid makes it easy
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
for everybody on this on this end of the
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
financial stuff then see the importance
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
of it and finally yeah it comes out of
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
the general fund but every dollar you
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
put into infrastructure on water and
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
wastewater comes back many F much F and
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in Mount Washington
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
Valley 400 people in North Conway water
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
Precinct went from from ground zero and
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
build $75 million worth of
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at an affordable rate
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
level if if if you go to um an extreme
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
level of rates three times the state
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
average so your rates are stressed you
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
get an extra 10% so you get 30% out of
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
the state aid grant so I tell everybody
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
at the local level put you put all the
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
money you can in out one pocket which is
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
your rates and then you can get 10% more
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
of the up Auto pocket which is long-term
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
debt and they do that because the way
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
they do it is they put once they pass a
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
bond they put all their money
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
immediately into design into a water
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
Wastewater master plan hire a consultant
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
find out what you want get a bond vote
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
on phase you build it by phases which it
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
takes a long time to do that uh it took
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
North Conway 25 years to go full bore
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
with a voter approval every single bond
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
to build out $75 million were worth the
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
work that money that invested money now
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
protects the the water m Washington
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
Valley it allows that the growth that's
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
occurring by that would have occurred
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
anyway uh to to uh handle all the Waters
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
of second homes mobile homes uh Parks uh
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
all the tourism Mount Washington Valley
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
goes from about um a population of
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
15,000 to 36,000 overnight it's like the
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
city of Rochester the money that comes
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
out of rooms and meals into the general
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
copper is is is far greater than the
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
money that comes out of this leverage
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
budget to pay it so it's a great
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
investment in the money you need in the
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
general budget I I I'm I'm sorry I went
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
on so long but uh I think these
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
reminders of all of this uh information
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
is critical for for new members and and
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
for to jump start this bill and thank
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
you m Mr chairman for letting me present
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
so long yeah you wrote down three
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
minutes I think it was maybe triple
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative papovich moment thank you
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for testifying
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
and taking the question I'm on finance 2
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and this is a finance one bill so I
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
really don't have a lot of background
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge on it I thought you had I
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you testify at the
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
towards the beginning of the testimony
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
that this is U more of a pass through
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
for federal funds and then at the end I
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard you say that this comes out of the
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
general fund could you help me clarify
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
my confusion and explain if this entire
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
Mount is bonded by the towns and they do
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
the projects that we hope they will how
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
much money will the state itself be on
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
the hook for out of this appropriation
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
balar well once they once the governor
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
and Council approves the the payments it
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
it pays 30% of principal interest on the
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
local debt so it's a great leveraging
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
because overall now that 15 million
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
which which you can count on being every
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
year even if you if few people pass it
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
that way make it that way um that that f
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
is funding right now $600 Million worth
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
of local
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
debt um and and once it goes to Governor
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
counil it changes a little bit because
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
it now instead of a promise because the
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
law says the state shall pay um it
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
becomes a contract where the state where
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
now the towns know that the state the
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
government Council has actually entered
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
into a contract to make those payments
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
for 20 to 30 Years thank you
 
00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:58.109 align:start position:0%
for 20 to 30 Years thank you
representative

00:55:58.109 --> 00:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
Lehman thank you Mr chairman and nice to
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
see you Bill so I'm a little confused
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
because in the past we've we've
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
obviously called these Buco bucks for
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
the new members because Tom has been
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
submitting this request for the at least
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
the last nine
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
terms but are these for new projects or
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
to pay off existing projects because in
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
the past we put the money forward to
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
meet our past
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
obligations but I'm hearing that this
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
may be for new projects
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
that and P obligations is that correct
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and thank you
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
for clarifying that yes this bill this
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
bill addresses the fact that the budget
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
that comes forward every year is a what
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
the What's called the maintenance budget
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
and the maintenance budget is paying the
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
obligation that's already gone to
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
Governor counsel for approval so to
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
maintain that obligated uh contract if
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
you will because now the process has
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
been completed uh as far as the state
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
committing to it uh you have no money
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
for new projects unless you put it in in
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
the budget and that 15 million puts it
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
in the budget at what is what we have
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
come to understand is is enough to to
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
fund the full budget going forward even
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
though the demand might go up to we have
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
one point the old study said we have 1.3
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
billion worth of need to build the
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that was before the
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
housing came in and recent years so I
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
suspect we have much much more than that
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
to to to build and accomplish to meet
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
the uh needs of the state's housing and
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
other protection of its Waters so this
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
this does put in money for new projects
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
and that flatlined estimate is what
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
we've worked with the to come to
 
00:57:50.029 --> 00:57:50.039 align:start position:0%
understand is what's needed when when
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
you see what what actually comes in on
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
the next cycle the dees could could
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
modify that but we don't think they need
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
to because it it's such a cycle of
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
building and waiting for the oneyear
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
warranty and and even though it's
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
Project's approved the money's there
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to be some years before it
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually is committed by a governor
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
counsel for payment so that that Rhythm
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
seem the 15 million seems to put enough
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
money in now uh and and last session U
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
you people understood enough to put it
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
in for this year this is the first time
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
ever that we've come into a new budget
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
cycle with 20 with the money in the
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
first year 2025 the money's there for
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
new projects under the under the last
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill of 15 million this bill tries to
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
say keep it going for 26 and 27 so after
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
the next election two-year cycle they
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
come into 27 and money's if new projects
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
like it is now that's the first time
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
that I've been here and I've been here a
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
long time um whole person Mr H thank you
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
very much uh representative rang we're
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
going to be discussing this in division
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
so if you can hold your question that
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be good thank you I still have two
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
more cards and we're running out of time
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
so next we have uh Miss Burns again from
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning Margaret burns
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire municipal
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
Association here in strong support of
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 97 House Bill 97 appropriates
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
$15 million in fiscal year 26 and 27
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
respectively to provide the grants for
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
local Wastewater projects as required by
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
RSA chapter 486 these grants cover the
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
cost of planning design and construction
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
of sewage disposal facilities covering
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
20 to 30% of these eligible costs there
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
is a long and storied history of
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistent funding that has left many
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities to foot the state share
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
over the years um dating back to uh
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
changes made after the Great Recession
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and really starting in 2008 more than
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
$50 million in the state share was
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
funded by municipalities over those
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
years lack of funding has also led to
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
long periods of projects that are
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
otherwise eligible and are ready to go
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
and ready to receive these grants being
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
placed on a delayed and deferred list
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
the current banial budget does include
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
as mentioned before $27.9 million for
 
01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039 align:start position:0%
the SAG grants the state aid grants for
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities and even included a
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
policy statement that it is the intent
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
of the legislature when adopting that
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
budget that state aid grants would
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
continue to be funded at $115 million
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
annually for 2026 and
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
2027 this bill would fulfill that policy
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
promise made to municipalities and to
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers many of which went into
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
approving these projects with the
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that the municipality
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
would receive the 20 to 30% state aid
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
grants that are required by RSA chapter
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
486 I know this committee has already
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
received some letters from
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities with projects that would
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive the grant funding
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
I believe from Durham from marac um from
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
other from Claremont and from other
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
communities as well this is an important
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for these
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities it shows a state and
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
local partnership in addressing not only
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
the need for Wastewater and Wastewater
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
upgrades but also the need for a
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
partnership between the state and
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities in supporting growth and
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
development which is not possible
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
without key infrastructure thank you so

government Affairs committee uh the the
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
funding here is often overlooked and
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
largely because it goes away you flly
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
and it goes away so what I'm here to do
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
today is remind you that there are
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
people out there working every day to
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
make sure what you flush goes away
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
properly and um in New Hampshire of our
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
234 communities um just under a 100 have
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
publicly owned treatment plants and many
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
of those are Regional in Solutions um
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
have all of you toured a wastewater
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
treatment plant if you haven't I can
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
help you get there it' be really fun but
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
wiip pasak River Basin program was a
 
01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
jewel uh that made our water Winn pasak
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
clean and the river so that serves 10
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
different communities so there are small
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities who can't do this alone
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
Plymouth New Hampshire I live in
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
holderness right across the river um
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
they got funding through this process
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
and were able to upgrade their septage
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
receiving so they take in septage from
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
30 different towns in the North Country
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
who do not have wastewater treatment
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
plants this is an essential service it's
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
an important thing for um business you
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
can't run Business Without a toilet for
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
your employees um it's also really
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
important for protecting our environment
 
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
and it goes underloved and underc cared
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
for um on on the financial piece of it
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
this 15 million gets us back to level
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
funding that we need to stay at for
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
several years we weren't getting any
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
funding and so as representative
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
leechman alluded to we got caught up now
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
we've made good on those obligations and
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
we need to continue this investment um
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
in Manchester some of the pipes are over
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
a hundred years old in the ground when
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
they fail it's catastrophic so we need
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
to invest in this infrastructure we need
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%

the healthy state soil Bill the state
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
has already made a commitment to invest
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the state's soil Health soil health
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
is really important to support in our
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
State especially as we are subject to
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
droughts and flooding and increasing
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
Pest and invasive plant
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
infestations many states have provided
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
funding to build on their soil Health
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and to supplement the gaps
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
in federal
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
support often these programs leverage
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
Federal and private
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
investment in New Hampshire the base
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
funding for the conservation districts
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
comes from our counties and that money
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
goes to run the administration and
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
programs for the County Conservation
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
districts 20% of the revenue from the
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
Moose plates also go to the conservation
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
programs the conservation districts
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
receive no money from UNH extension but
 
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
they work with them there is great work
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
being done in New Hampshire through our
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
conservation districts with regard to
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
supporting farmers and their Farm
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
resilience projects they do a phenomenal
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
job of leveraging the funds that they
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
they do receive and they have achieved
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
great things the conservation districts
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
have had past philanth philanthropic
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
support to continue their important and
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
popular Farm Grant programs but an added
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
State support component as this bill
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
requests would accomplish three
 
01:09:16.839 --> 01:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
requests would accomplish three
important

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
things first of all state support will
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood that current as
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
well as additional private donors will
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
continue to support the
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
programs secondly helping our
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community improve their
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
soil will increase yields and production
 
01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
and thereby increase what the farmers
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
produce and sell and thereby increase
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
our state tax
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
revenues so for the state it is an
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
important investment in our production
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
resources direct grants to Farms to
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
invest in on Farm infrastructure
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
equipment and Innovative practices
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
support farm profitability and the
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
long-term viability of New Hampshire's
 
01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.510 align:start position:0%
long-term viability of New Hampshire's
agricultural

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
sector number three helping our
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community improve their
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
soil and farming practices will make
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
their lands more impervious to flooding
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
droughts and pests and thereby reduce
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
their need for disaster help from the
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
state or elsewhere and helping them to
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
continue to produce food without
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
interruption the New Hampshire County
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
Conservation districts their Farm
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
viability program improves the
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
resilience of New Hampshire farms in the
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
face of extreme weather
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
events there's widespread support for
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
this work in the agricultural community
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
and the state established our
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
conservation districts and this is one
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
more aspect of the work that they are
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
doing not only for conservation but for
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
our agricultural Community as a whole
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
the mission of the New Hampshire
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
Conservation District's climate
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
resilience grant program supports our
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farmers to build soil
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
resilience throughout the Granite State
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
farmers utilize the grant funding to
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
increase resiliency of New Hampshire
 
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
farms in a CH a changing climate and
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
allow for adaptation while meeting the
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
Farm's conservation goals and needs
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events frequent and
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
prolonged droughts and increased pest
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
pressures are increasing challenges for
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
for our Farms these grants through the
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire County Conservation
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
District seek to support farmers in
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
meeting those challenges and in closing
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
I hope that you will agree that $50,000
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
a year from our general fund for the
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
next biennium would be a wise investment
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
in the grant programs that support our
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community as they struggle
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
to meet the challenges of dealing with
 
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events and increasing
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
pressures of invasive pests and plants
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
there there are other testimonies after
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
me that should demonstrate the successes
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
of these programs and the need for State
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
support I would ask that the chair call
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
uh M Amanda Littleton from the
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
conservation districts after me and she
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
can explain more about the the programs
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
and I would also encourage all the
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to read some of
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
the online testimony that has been
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
submitted because they have some very
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
important and compelling um things to
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
say to our committee members I want to
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I hope you will
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
really seriously consider that this
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
small investment will go a very very
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
long way to help the vibrancy of our
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community thank
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you representative so um
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
we'll save questions for others is that
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
what you you may or I I mean I can
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
answer to the best of my ability but I
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
think there are folks behind me who are
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually in the trenches uh availing
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
themselves of the grant funding and also
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
um who administer the grant funding and
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
can tell you the successes that they've
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
been met with all right thank you very
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
much so we'll just hear from your
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor representative Bixby and then
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
you good morning for the record uh
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Bixby from do New
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire straford District
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
13 uh and uh I a lot of what I uh have
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
to say has been covered fairly well by
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh um my colleague but I just want to um
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
hit a few points to to emphasize them um
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
just at the outset I want to reemphasize
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
this is about leveraging PRI more
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
private donations uh this will P provide
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
a relatively small portion of the full
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
um budget for this program but it's an
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
important to have that small out to get
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
um other donors to put to uh see this as
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
a public private
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
partnership uh I've been a homestead
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
Gardener for about 25 years now in New
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I have watched as the um
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
weather patterns have changed over the
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
last uh couple of decades uh we now have
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
longer exper longer periods of drought
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
more periods of intense rain
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh it makes it U it's difficult to
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
adjust to that uh on my scale and where
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's not you know I'm not going to lose
 
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
my livelihood if I fail uh I can manage
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh if this if you're a farmer you
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
really need to be able to adjust to
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
these uh changes in weather and uh one
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
example is that uh for a very long time
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
people growing field crops have just fig
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
figured that there's going to be enough
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
rain over the summer to uh get the crops
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
through that's not always the case
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
anymore um
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
so uh having the conservation districts
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
able to provide small grants to the
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
farmers so they can build their
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh to build resilience to
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
these to the uh different patterns and
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
weather that we're seeing is really
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
important uh and uh so that is that is
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
really the TRS of what this program does
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
it helps provide more resilience to the
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
Farms so that they can uh a be more
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
profitable and B if there is a if there
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
is adverse weather they don't have the
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
same level of costs to recover from that
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
they would that they would before uh I
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
you were probably here back in 2016 when
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
we had a bill um that cost the state
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
more than a million dollars to help
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
provide help for Dairy Farmers uh who
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
had been struck very hard by a drought
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're hoping that uh with if we can
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
build propop uh soil resilience that's
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
not something we're going to be seeing
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
again where we have to chip in at that
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
level of money uh a
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
$50,000 that will help a whole lot of
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
farms is a lot cheaper than um than than
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
the recovery money that we could
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
possibly be asked for if we don't do
 
01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
that uh so uh just to
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
um reiterate uh this is a small
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
investment that we that will have large
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
paybacks and uh I'd be happy to take
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
questions but I think that there are
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
people who are coming up after me who
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
have more specific examples of how Farms
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
have been helped in the past we have
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
some farmers who in fact have had
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
experience with the program uh and also
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
more about the det details of how the
 
01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
Conservation District funding Works uh
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
from uh Miss Littleton and Mr Hanley yes
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we we'll do
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
that um I'll call Amanda Littleton from
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
District good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the house finance committee
 
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here my name is
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
Amanda Littleton I'm with the chesher
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
district is that better great so since
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
the 1940s the conservation districts
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
have worked with Farms on the
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
conservation and responsible use of
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
natural and agricultural resources so to
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
further meet that mission in 2022 we
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
launched this grant program to help
 
01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
build Farm resilience and it's through
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
adaptation and mitigation measures the
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
program was really developed in response
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
to these extreme weather events that
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
you've been been hearing about the
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
frequent and prolonged droughts The
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
increased press pest pressures and the
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
livestock heat stress that's caused by
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
our changing climate what it does is it
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
provides Farms up to
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
$10,000 for a grant to implement these
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
Solutions and challenges that they
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
identify as the most pressing on their
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
operations it really does fill a gap
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
where state and federal dollars fall
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
short it puts farmers in the driver's
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
seat they choose what they are applying
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
for they get to be Innovative and create
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
the solutions as long as that they are
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
supported by science and that they are
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
they are going to be meet the scale of
 
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
their Farm business here in New
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the four categories that Grant
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
funds are provided in are for soil
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
Health Water Management on-farm energy
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
and crop and livestock protection since
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
since launch in 2022 the districts have
 
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
made 95 Grant Awards to Farms investing
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
over 700
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
$5,000 these grants have supported farms
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
in all 10 counties representing 58 towns
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
which is about 25% of New Hampshire
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities additionally 53% of the
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
awardees are considered historically
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
underserved the challenge that we face
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
now is sustaining a program that has
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
been successful in meeting the needs of
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
farmers and meeting their demands of
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
what what they're saying that the the
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
the climate is providing to them
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
currently there is not enough funding to
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
meet the all of the requests that we are
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
receiving in
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
applications in the past Grant rounds we
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
have had to turn down approximately 30%
 
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.470 align:start position:0%
have had to turn down approximately 30%
of

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
applications and to date as you had
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
heard earlier this program has been
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
funded primarily by private donations
 
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.669 align:start position:0%
funded primarily by private donations
and

01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
Foundations but the farmers are
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
contributing as well they have skin in
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
the game all of them are contributing
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
between 25 to 50% of project
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
costs we're seeking State
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
support to leverage these private
 
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
dollars by the foundations donors and
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
Farmers to sustain this program bringing
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in line with other
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
northeast states that already support
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
farms in the similar manner this support
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
would ensure a Level Playing Field for
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farm
 
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
businesses the $50,000 per year that the
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
for the from the state that we are
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
requesting to implement this program
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be used for direct grants to
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
Farmers helping them produce more food
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
be more profitable and contribute to the
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
strong agricultural
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
economy and if successful this would
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
bring the state as that third partner
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
with the private donors and the state's
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
contribution would be 12% of the overall
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
annual budget for this
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
program though it's modest it's
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical it will have an
 
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
outsized impact and the public private
 
01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
partnership would demonstrate a shared
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility and encourage private
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
donors to continue their
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
support just want to share one quote
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
from one of the online testimonials I
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
think this sums it up from one of the
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
farmers an ounce of prevention is worth
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
a pound of cure I'm sure you've heard
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
that well an ounce of this resiliency
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
planning and implementation is worth
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
pounds of recovery expenses into the
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
future for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you than you so much for
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
considering passing this bill we really
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much so uh
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
question yes representative Edwards uh
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question this this is a topic
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
that uh is pretty new to me I focus
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
mostly on healthc care issues um I I'm
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious if the payback on this
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
program is so high and I'm assuming this
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
is the assumption that the applicants
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
are all private citizens looking to make
 
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
improvements to private property if the
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
payback is so
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
high why aren't they just simply
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
investing because the payback is so
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
great what what what is it about this
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
that makes it a a shared private uh
 
01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.990 align:start position:0%
that makes it a a shared private uh
public

01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
partnership well thank you very much for
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
the question um I think that agriculture
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
is a challenging business profit margins
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
are notoriously slim and it's really
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
many of them hold a significant debt
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
load as well um many Farm businesses
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
find the added Investments for equipment
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure that are needed are
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
often put off because of the day-to-day
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
expenses of their operating costs and
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
why should it be a shared expense I
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that's a very good question I
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
think what it comes down to is food
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
security for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
as we move forward um that's one thing I
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
think the second thing is that many of
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
these practices are helping to improve
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
water quality in the state of New
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well many of the soil
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
Health practices are contributing to
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
less runoff and erosion into our surface
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
waters we're also helping with the water
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
management practices for irrigation
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
those are helping to conserve more water
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
in many cases because they're moving to
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
more efficient systems so I think
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
overall it's a win for the agricultural
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
community and also for the larger
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
population of residences in our
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
state thank you um representative
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
camroll thank you Mr chair uh I'm just
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
curious what is the current balance of
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
the fund so we go on an annual basis for
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
private funders and so right now we are
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
we do have an active grant program
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
underway for 2025 and we hope to provide
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
$336,000 in Grants to farm businesses
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
for 2025 and these funds that we are
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
requesting would go to the 26 and 27
 
01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.030 align:start position:0%
requesting would go to the 26 and 27
Grant

01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
year thank you other questions
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative Neville uh thank you
 
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I was taking my question Mr
 
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
Littleton how many I'm I'm unfamiliar
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
with the whole farming sector you know
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
except for the local Farm stands but how
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
many farms are we talking about in New
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in total and and what's the
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
trend in uh say for the last 5 to 10
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
years I think farms uh you know we see
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
challenges I I I'll as a proxy I'll use
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
the number for Dairy Farms as an example
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
I believe our state of New Hampshire is
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
down to approximately 60 dairy farms if
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
you look at the trends going back
 
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of them in the between 1950s
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
now so many have gone out of business
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
and that is a real concern and
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
especially when you look at our dairy
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
farms because the land base upon which
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
they are managing it is the bulk of the
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural land and production this is
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
a trend that can be looked at Beyond
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
dairy farms though into all of them
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
because of challenging land prices
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
having access to land is a real
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
challenge so the need to support the
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
Farms that we do have on our
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
landscape is
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
critical so again you talk about dairy
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
farms I'm looking at the whole picture
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
excuse representative would you like as
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
followup I'm sorry I would like a quick
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
yes you may the the question was total
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
number of farms not just dairy farms uh
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
but the trend in total Farms I don't
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
have the numbers of a total number of
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
farms in the state of New Hampshire but
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
I can get that for you and I'd be happy
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
to follow up thank you all right we
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
still have many more cards and thank so
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank you for your time I
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um Ian Hunley from the New
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State conservation
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
committee and we'll follow uh by it
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
County thank you
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee uh
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Ian Hanley I the executive
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire State
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
conservation committee uh I want to take
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes and just provide
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
overall context for funding of
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
conservation districts in the state of
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as representative Aaron
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
said in her opening remarks the state
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
does not provide any overall Operational
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
Support for our districts um they are
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
primarily funded at the county level
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
five of our districts are given a lump
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
sum from the county that is primarily
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
used for funding their district manager
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
position the other five are given a
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
staff member as a County employee so
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
their district manager is a County
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
employee uh beyond that initial sum to
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
provide a staff member most of our
 
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
counties receive or most of our
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
districts receive little to no
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
additional support from their County
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
um other funding sources are primarily
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
project-based and so as representative
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
Aaron said they are eligible to apply
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
for moose plate grants so the SEC runs
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Moose plate grant program um which
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
districts can apply to again that is
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
Project based it's tied to a specific
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
project um they also are eligible for
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
additional funding through Cooperative
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
agreement with the natural resource
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
conservation service and the New
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of conservation
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
districts again this is performance
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
Project based
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement other than that districts
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
are utilizing grant funding program
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh sales revenue things like
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
that to provide funding for any of their
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
programs and so
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh these project-based funding sources
 
01:27:48.199 --> 01:27:49.149 align:start position:0%
uh these project-based funding sources
are

01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
not uh able to be applied to the climate
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
resilience Grant and so as Amanda was
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
saying the grant funding has been
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
primarily through private donors and
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
Foundations and so that's why we bring
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
this to the state to provide support for
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
that to help continue this program um in
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
my testimony I also put have some
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
numbers in there about what states
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
surrounding us do at a state level and
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
also discuss
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
the financial reporting requirements
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
that the conservation districts uh do
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
annually part of my role at the state
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
conservation committee is making sure
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
that they're meeting their statutory
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
obligations to uh for financial
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
reporting and so I work with them on
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
that um and I know because we've got a
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of farmers and other people that
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
would like to speak I don't want to go
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
into too much detail on that but I
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
provided additional information in my
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chairman thank you thank
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
you very much representative rang thank
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um you noted that that you
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
had written testimony has that been
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
distributed or was it emailed I don't
 
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
distributed or was it emailed I don't
have

01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.030 align:start position:0%
have
it

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
one representative Edward thank thank
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh again this is uh this
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
is a new topic to me and and so you're
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
using the phrasee
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
climate resilient project and I'm trying
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
to figure out what that is on the ground
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
is that a pond is that a retaining wall
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
is that a tree line is it an umbrella
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
what what what are we doing to create a
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
climate resistant Pro or a resilient
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
project yeah thank you for the question
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
um as Amanda was saying it is uh this
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
grant opportunity is open to a variety
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
of different projects But ultimately
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
frequently these are addressing either
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
um increased heavy precipitation events
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
so heavy rainfall they could be
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
addressing drought and the Farm's
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
ability to retain uh water in case of
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
drought um it affects their they could
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
apply for projects to help them uh with
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
energy um you know they could they could
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
do a whole bunch of things but
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately a lot of projects focus on
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
either the uh dealing with heavy
 
01:30:27.109 --> 01:30:27.119 align:start position:0%
rainfall events and the flooding that
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
comes with that or addressing water
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
retention from droughts that are
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
becoming more frequent um and we do have
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
a few Farmers here which are going to
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
discuss some of their projects in more
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
detail that they were
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
doing representative Ms and then we'll
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
move on thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question hopefully it's a
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
quick one um you mentioned that the uh
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
districts do not get do currently do not
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
get any state funding has that always
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
been the case or uh did they previously
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
funding thank you for the question to my
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge to the best of my knowledge
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
they have not if they did this would
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
have been decades ago that they received
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
it um when I so I've been in my role for
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
three and a half years I inherited a few
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
boxes of old minutes from you know 60s
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
70s 80s things like that which were
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
incomplete I tried to go through them as
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
best as I could but to my knowledge uh
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been State funding for
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
districts in um in a while if there was
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
any at all thank you thank you thank you
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
very much thank you chairman so we have
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
um Don and baskam from Sullivan County
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's also another from Sullivan
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
County Lionel Sho would you maybe like
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
to come together speak together no okay
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
well you put down five minutes or six
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
minutes so we're going to give you a
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
fraction of that okay well uh good
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
morning chair and members of the
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Donna basam and I'm
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
a resident of Charlestown New Hampshire
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and I'm here today to
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of Bill HB
 
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
246 I am a farmer um I'm I'm probably
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
what you would call a uh in terms of
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
vegetable production a market scale
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
Gardener um we also produced my husband
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
Dean baskam and I raised she for meat we
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
have about 50 head of sheep we operate a
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
Sugar Bush of 6,000 Taps and in addition
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
to the organic vegetable production and
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
we depend on this
 
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
income for our
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
livelihood uh farming has always been
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
difficult even in the best of times um
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
weather conditions in the past decade
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
however made farming even more
 
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
challenging and
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
risky uh having spent most of my life
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
and career working outside as a child
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
growing up in
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
Maine uh as a soil scientist and as a
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
soil conservationist in a previous life
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
also as a sailor on the ocean where you
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're very tied into what's going on
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know in the
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
weather I can attest that conditions
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
have become more extreme heat cold rain
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
events and drought are more and more
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and you know climate
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
resiliency means adapting to
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
unpredictability to the best of your
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
ability um this grant program has
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
provided critical access to tools and
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
equipment that make it possible for
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
farms in New Hampshire to adapt and
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
thrive in the face of increasingly
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
challenging weather conditions this
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
translates directly into increased
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
um for Farms of excuse me of food on New
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farms for consumers in our
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
state even in the months outside of
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
normal production Seasons which you
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't really think about but we are now
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
capable of
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
producing uh fresh produce well into
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
December and January even so a lot has
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
changed in agriculture and that that
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
makes New Hampshire
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
farms uh on their way to supplying a
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
significant amount of our state's food
 
01:34:32.119 --> 01:34:34.189 align:start position:0%
significant amount of our state's food
supply

01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and and that's a bonus for Farmers it
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
increases our
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
profitability and all of the Farms who
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
have been able to implement projects
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
funded by these grants have seen you
 
01:34:48.719 --> 01:34:49.790 align:start position:0%
funded by these grants have seen you
know

01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
tremendous uh Improvement in their
 
01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.270 align:start position:0%
tremendous uh Improvement in their
farming

01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
farming
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
operations and I I just want to end with
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
telling you a story about what um you
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
know unexpected weather events are like
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
on May 22nd our farm was preparing for
 
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
planting a significant crop of potatoes
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
and carrots we had land opened up for
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
seeding uh and out of nowhere came a 4.5
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
in rain and hail storm that last Ed that
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
was that was all dropped in a little
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
over an hour and it caused tremendous
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
damage and erosion of valuable soil
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
which is you know a limited resource
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
protect um we could not get those crops
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
in and it it severely undermined my
 
01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
in and it it severely undermined my
growing

01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
season um but now with the help of this
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
grant this coming year I've been able to
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
apply for a 100 foot by 16t they're
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
called caterpillar tunnels and I wish I
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
will submit a very a five slide um
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint to for you to all look at to
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding of what we
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
mean by climate resiliency and what are
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the practices that we use um anyways
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
that tunnel is going to allow me to
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
plant even if we have drought or if we
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
have another flooding season
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
um it it will give me more resiliency
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
and more resiliency to produce a crop
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
for our consumers so I thank you for
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
your time and attention to this
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
important bill I'd be happy to answer
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee may
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
have questions seeing n thank you very
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
much Miss basam Mr
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
Sho and we
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
will follow with
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
seeto okay thank you Mr sh uh thank you
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
hello everyone uh it's a pleasure to be
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
here today um I'm Lionel Chu I'm the
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
director of Natural Resources for
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and also the district
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
manager of the Sullivan County
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
Conservation District I've been doing
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
this work for uh 12 years now and um I I
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the conversation that's
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
happened so far and I'll try to add some
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
value to that um just to be clear we're
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
talking about food we're talking about
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
the variety of food that we're capable
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
of producing here in New Hampshire uh
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
things that range from honey to maple
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
syrup meat eggs vegetables tree fruits
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh berries dairy grains nuts oil uh
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
these are all things that we're capable
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
of of producing and most of us are
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
enjoying we go out and we uh we hit a
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
Farm Stand or buy something local and uh
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
um it's it's part of our quality of life
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to say um I really want to
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
go to the question that representative
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
Edwards rais because I think it's
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
critical and Central to the discussion
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the question was if the payback is
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
high why are public dollars needed and
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share a little something
 
01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.189 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share a little something
with

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
you according to the 2022 USDA census of
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
Agriculture 80%
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
of commercial New Hampshire
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
Farms grossed under
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
$25,000 per
 
01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.390 align:start position:0%
$25,000 per
year

01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
92% of New Hampshire Farms grossed under
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
year and this is consistent with the
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
Farms of my county of Sullivan County
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
76% of farms are grossing less than
 
01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
$25,000 and 90% are grossing less than
 
01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.870 align:start position:0%
$25,000 and 90% are grossing less than
$100,000

01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
so this is gross and not net in good
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
years most Farms are averaging a net
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
profit of about
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
10% so if a farm is grossing less than
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 which would be 90% of all the
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
farms in the
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
state then they're netting less than
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
$10,000 and that
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 has to cover family living
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
income tax principal on land non-
 
01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.430 align:start position:0%
income tax principal on land non-
depreciable

01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
depreciable
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
expenses so for for 80% of New Hampshire
 
01:39:34.589 --> 01:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
Farms grossing under
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
$25,000 the average yearly profit is
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
$2500 so not surprisingly every a census
 
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
$2500 so not surprisingly every a census
since

01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
2007 has consistently shown that between
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
68 and 72% of New Hampshire Farms have
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
negative cash net cash from
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
operations negative net cash from
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
operations which means that there is no
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
depreciation taken for tractors for
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
buildings for equipment Etc so we're
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
talking about an agricultural system
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
that is really Hanging On by a
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
thread and these funds the other
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
question that I wanted to respond to is
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
U conservation districts have never
 
01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:25.719 align:start position:0%
received uh State funding since they
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
started in the' 40s um and and this is
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
not uh a change of that policy because
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
this is strictly pass through funding so
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about bringing
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
$5,000 per District strictly for the
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of this Grant and nothing else
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
it it will never see the these dollars
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll simply incorporate it in our
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
grant round for the climate resiliency
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
Grant and we'll have an extra $5,000 per
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
district for two years to to pair up
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the 30 to $40,000 of private money
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
that we'll have um but we'll be able to
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
go back to the private funders and say
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
Yes New Hampshire does value this and
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
they were willing to to put a little
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
something in for it so and that will
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
make all the difference because our
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
private funders are at the point where
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're saying yeah we're into
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
it we want to do this but does the state
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
care and and so that's why we're here
 
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
today so um I would really enjoy any
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
additional question otherwise that's all
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
I've got today representative
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you have
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
any cost figures about the what it costs
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
the farmers when we have a severe
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
weather event and and who pays for that
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
cost yeah excellent um you know it's a
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
mess it's it's really it's tough the uh
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
natural resources conservation service
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
is the only Federal agency that uh
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
provides assistance to farms uh in New
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um they track all of that
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
i' I'd be happy to develop that for you
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have the statistics but I can
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
tell you just sort of conceptually that
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about things that happen
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden someone's wiped out
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
they've they've lost everything or
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
they've lost a lot of what they had
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's all their profit it's also a
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
whole lot of people depending on that
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
food their supply chain a ripple effects
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
as you might imagine and so that is
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
being tracked we have Federal disaster
 
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
declarations which are critical um but a
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
lot of times things are happening that
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't quite rise to that level they're
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
still wiping people out um and so uh
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
there are folks that are tracking that
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
and if if you would like more
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
information I can get that for
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
you all right one follow as a followup I
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
would also like to see uh if you have
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
any figures or statistics about the
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
implementation of a of of a
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
weather um resiliency climate resiliency
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
programs have on Farmers if there is a
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
reduction of their cost cost to they you
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
know yes well we we're doing that now so
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're tracking our metrics uh from
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
the time that we started our pilot three
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
years ago um we require all of the grant
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
recipients to First identify for us uh
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
how this is going to benefit them and
 
01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
then document uh the the improvements
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
that have happened and so um very fast I
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
can just tell you we've had projects
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
that included a solar track or array uh
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
silvo pasture and rotational grazing uh
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
we put in a water well uh for a farm
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
that uh the field went completely dry it
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
had been fine for over 150 years that
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
that that family had been farming
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
continuously on the land um and so yes
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
we are tracking those things everything
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
has to make sense we have such limited
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
resources that we have to be careful
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
about who we give this money to and make
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we're really making a
 
01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
sure that we're really making a
difference

01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank you very much Mr sh
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
we have Mr
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
sampo yes and followed by the Robinsons
 
01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:40.629 align:start position:0%
sampo yes and followed by the Robinsons
from

01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh good morning Mr chairman and

districts NH J CD is is the acronym that
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
we use so that's further
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
down I am here to testify and support in
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of the $50,000 in the
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
state budget to fund the climate
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
resiliency Grant nhad supports all 10
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
conservation districts across the state
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire working collaboratively
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
to support the state's Agricultural and
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
natural resource
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
communities one of the goals of the
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
conservation districts is to help the
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
small new and underserved Farmers
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%

survive and prosper in the face of the
current

01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
challenges over the past few years the
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
climate resiliency grant program has
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
provided critical support to these
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
Farmers enabling them to implement
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
Innovative and sustainable practices
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
that improve farm profitability and
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
operational efficiency to date the
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
program has awarded more than $700,000
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
in Grants with an additional
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
$330,000 allocated for this year these
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
grants capped $10,000 per AE have proven
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
instrumental in supporting projects that
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
enhanced productivity and reduced
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
operational costs for many
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
farms however up to this point all the
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
funding for the program has come
 
01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:13.639 align:start position:0%
primarily from private sources while we
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
deeply appreciate the generosity and
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
commitment of our private Partners it is
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
clear that long-term sustainability of
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
this program requires a public private
 
01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
partnership by allocating $50,000 in
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
state funding which is just 12% of the
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
program's annual budget New Hampshire
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
would signal its commitment to
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
supporting the agricultural community in
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring the program's future this
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
modest investment would have an outside
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
impact it would enable us to extend the
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
reach of the program supporting more
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
farmers in ensuring the benefits of
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
these grants such as improved
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
operational efficiency Inc inre
 
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
profitability and enhance Farm
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
sustainability all felt across our
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
communities furthermore by leveraging
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
the funding State funding
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
alongside private contributions we can
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
create a model of shared responsibility

enhance better
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
practices and to improve our re
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
resilience from Farms from storms sorry
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'm nervous our family has received this
 
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
Grant and with the funds we have
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
improved our manure pit to collect storm
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
water and to protect our hay feed from
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
the rain and snow snow which is to which
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
is to keep our waterways clean if we
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't received the funds the projects
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to get done
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
when we receive the grant funds we have
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
focused our funds to be spent in our
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
local town and state businesses I hope
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you increase the funds for this
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
grant so more Farmers have the same
 
01:49:14.589 --> 01:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we have been able
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%

applicants uh each year depending on
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
their funding requests and if more money
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
were appropriate we might able to uh
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
fund more farms and
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
producers um with the priz of inflation
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
and changing of weather patterns
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%

agriculture now I expect that's less
than

01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
5% um for various
 
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
reasons it's very important to have a

tell you for a fact that New Hampshire
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
EG agriculture is at a disadvantage when
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
we look at neighboring

both services and Grant programs uh we
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
received a grant to purchase an
 
01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
agricultural flame weeder in 2023 and
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'll be applying for the grant this year
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
to en enhance some of our green houses
 
01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.189 align:start position:0%
to en enhance some of our green houses
in

01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
2025 these pieces of equipment allow us
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
to farm efficiently uh and profitably uh
 
01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
and support our business which this is a
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
fledgling business for me I've worked at
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
the farm for nine years uh this I'm
 
01:54:43.629 --> 01:54:43.639 align:start position:0%
going into my third year of owning the
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
farm I'm not sure if any of y'all are
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
small business owners but uh if anybody
 
01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
is you can attest to the fact that there
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
are high startup costs uh coupled with
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
debt that we take on to purchase the
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
farm uh and to operate the farm that
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult to purchase pieces of
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
equipment uh agricultural equipment is
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
notoriously high cost um and without
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
this grant we would not be able to
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
purchase some of the vital pieces of
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
equipment that we use to farm profitably
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
to keep our pay our employees a fair
 
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
wage and to protect our soil which is
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
the most important part of our farm uh
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here today and I
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
am open to any questions thank you Mr
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
rxy representative Ms thank you Mr
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming in um when
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
you purchased the equipment that you
 
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
were able to buy with this grant um did
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
you buy that from local
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
businesses we that piece of equip is a
 
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
that is a specialized piece of equipment
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
uh I believe we get it out of Illinois
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of farm equipment is produced
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the Midwest because New England is
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
not considered typically or is not a hub
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
for uh larger farm equipment uh in the
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
United States so a lot of those
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
producers are out in the midwest quick
 
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.390 align:start position:0%
producers are out in the midwest quick
quick

01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
followup um did you buy it directly from
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
Illinois or through a dealer in New
 
01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it was through a dealer out
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
of Virginia okay however the grant that
 
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
we will be applying for in 2025 uh we
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
will be buying all of that equipment
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
from uh a New Hampshire business Rim all
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
green houses there are lots of
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire that produce
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
equipment just this specialized piece of
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
equipment is not produced in New
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire great thank you thank you very
 
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
much for coming so Mr Trimble is our
 
01:56:36.679 --> 01:56:47.430 align:start position:0%
much for coming so Mr Trimble is our
last

01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
one morning Mr chairman and committee
 
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
members uh my name is David Trumble I'm
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
from the aware I own and operate Good
 
01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
Earth Farm I've been a farmer for over
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
40 years and I've run my own business
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
for 39 years uh it's a family farm we
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
hire part-time seasonal help and sell
 
01:57:07.709 --> 01:57:07.719 align:start position:0%
mostly directly to the consumers
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
although some wholesale um I'll try and
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
get to some of the key points first is
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
linking this to climate
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
resilience I looked at the website of
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
this program we have not filed for one
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
of these grants although I am looking at
 
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
doing it for this year uh the the
 
01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
programs are amazing if you can scroll
 
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
down the map and just hit on each of the
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
stars and see what they've done and I've
 
01:57:32.589 --> 01:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
been around farming New Hampshire so I
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
know a lot of the people and these are
 
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
really really good farmers and they I'm
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
not here today because they're home
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
working on their Farms but what the
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
things they've done have been very
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
productive so I just want to talk about
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
one example which is soil Health if you
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
can reduce the tillage of your soil then
 
01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
you can protect your soil health so some
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the equipment is no till Planters
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
perfecta field cultivators silage tarps
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
things like that that you can use these
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
grants for if you reduce the tillage on
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
your soil you're not breaking down
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
organic matter why does that matter the
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
general rule thumb is every 1% of
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
organic matter gives you about a week of
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
protection against drought so if you're
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
plowing up that field and like the old
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
days just harrowing it and harrowing it
 
01:58:19.709 --> 01:58:19.719 align:start position:0%
the organic matter is going to drop
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
there goes your drought resistance
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
another thing thing as exposed Fields
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
being able to get in and out quickly uh
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
using the silage tarps you can get into
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
your cover crop quickly or you can get
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
into your cash crop quickly why is that
 
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
important because single weather events
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
generally account for one single weather
 
01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
event a third of soil erosion in the
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
United States no I'm not saying one
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
weather event in the whole country but I
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
guess saying on a farm it's usually just
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
one event causes tremendous damage if
 
01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
you can get more quickly into where you
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
need to go plant your crop then you have
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
roots in the ground you don't have the
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
effects of the erosion so these expenses
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
are protecting the soil and that goes to
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
the question of why is this a public
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
partnership the farmer has a duty to
 
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
leave the farm better than when they
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
started there but it's not just for your
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
own Farm sake you are managing that land
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the future of our society so we as
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
Farmers have a duty to everybody to
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
protect the soil to protect the land and
 
01:59:22.069 --> 01:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
this grant here is saying hey we're as a
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
Society going to help you protect the
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
land and the speaker just said we're
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
down we lost the whole percent of
 
01:59:31.229 --> 01:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
agricultural land from 6 to 5% the best
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
protection for New Hampshire's open land
 
01:59:36.910 --> 01:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
is a successful working farm if the land
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
is not being used productively it's
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
eventually going to go to Shrub or it's
 
01:59:42.669 --> 01:59:42.679 align:start position:0%
going to be developed into something
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
else if you want to keep New Hampshire
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
with open land you want to have
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
successful working Farms there also
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
there's the economic aspect of it
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
there's 4,000 is farms in New Hampshire
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
that uh generate $120 million a year in
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
Wages that's direct Farm wages when you
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
figure in the multiplier effects you
 
02:00:06.069 --> 02:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
know every dollar that goes into a farm
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
is spent you get a 3 to1 rough
 
02:00:11.069 --> 02:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
multiplier the total economic output of
 
02:00:14.109 --> 02:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farms is over $500 million
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
a year and that's from a 2019 Department
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture report called the
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
economic impact of agriculture in New
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's obvious ly a little
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
bit probably about the same now we lost
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
a little land but inflation's gone up so
 
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a half a billion
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars it's huge so Farms are important
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
for the future of our soil they're
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
important for us growing food they're
 
02:00:37.069 --> 02:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
also important to our e our economy so
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
um I would urge this you to please join
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
in with the other states around us that
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
are trying to say farming is an
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
important sector of our economy we have
 
02:00:47.709 --> 02:00:47.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs in the state
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
government that help a lot of different
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
sectors helping the Farms is also
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
valuable thank you thank you very much
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
Mr trumo so we had also a uh blue sheet
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
with 12 names on it nine of which you've
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
heard from so there are three new ones
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
all in favor so I'm going to close the
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing for House Bill 246 I want
 
02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:10.199 align:start position:0%

that the shelter has been open there
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
were young people who were turned away

working with these young youth early in
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
their adult life is essential not only
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
for reducing chronic homelessness but
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
also for saving public funds in the long
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
run the age range of 18 to 24 is a
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
critical time for social emotional and
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
financial development as youth become

program for New Hampshire home homeless
 
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
youth the director of the shelter and
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
the executive director of wayo are both
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
here and we'll be able to talk with you
 
02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:43.719 align:start position:0%
more about the financial situation of
 
02:04:43.719 --> 02:04:44.390 align:start position:0%
more about the financial situation of
the

02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
shelter and I am open to questions thank
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative Edwards
 
02:04:56.109 --> 02:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
um I I have U two general policy
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
questions um that you may be able to
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
answer you may not um um first is um I
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
was surprised that this came directly to
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee without going through
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
a policy committee first do do you
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
happen to have any idea how what was
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
behind the decision to stand straight to
 
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
finance instead of going through a
 
02:05:20.549 --> 02:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
policy committee no I have no no
 
02:05:22.510 --> 02:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
information about that thing thank you
 
02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
followup um I am assuming and and you
 
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
could clarify my assumption that there
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
are other um Youth and Young Adult
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
shelters in New Hampshire uh and that
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
there there's a program managed by
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS why wouldn't this be part of the
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
standard budget process instead of a
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
one-off funding request what what what
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
makes this a one-off funding request
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the Waypoint
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
shelter for youth is the only Youth
 
02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
Shelter in the state and I think that
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
when um the executive director from
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
Waypoint comes up I think you can
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
explore with him a little bit more about
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
the funding and uh why the funding's
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
needed and what the relationship is with
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
02:06:17.229 --> 02:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
Services around it I think the
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
department might also be here today um
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
and be able to talk a little bit more
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
thoroughly about the financing thank you
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions thank you Mr
 
02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
shair all right any other questions
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative walner we also have
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
nashwa thank you very much for letting
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
me speak today um I just wanted to give
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit of um background and
 
02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
perspective on youth homelessness here
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
in in uh New Hampshire I don't know
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
everything that's happening with youth
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
homelessness across the state um but I
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
do know kind of what's happening in
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
nashaa um there was another youth
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
homeless program um in NASA that closed
 
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
its do in April of last year um it was
 
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
not associated with DHHS it was not
 
02:07:13.229 --> 02:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
funded by the state in any way it was a
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
private uh charitable organization um
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
however uh their funding dried up they
 
02:07:20.350 --> 02:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
had some board member problems and they
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
closed on April 12 and gave this the um
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
kids who were there two weeks to find
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
alternate living arrangements um my
 
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is most of those kids were
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
not able to find alternative living
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
arrangements I have no idea where they
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
are now a few of them went up to
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester um most of them are just
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
floating in the wind um the way that
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS deals with homeless youth is they
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
are only responsible for kids who have
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
aged out of foster care um or resid
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
itial placement um and that is a
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary program um and kids have the
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
right to say no and many do many don't
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
want to stay in foster care or stay in a
 
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
group home um and follow whatever rules
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
there are and curfews uh once they turn
 
02:08:13.069 --> 02:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
18 um those kids if they say no to that
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
program there is no other alternative
 
02:08:17.310 --> 02:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
for them except for this Waypoint Youth
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
Shelter um we do have other homeless
 
02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
shelters in the state OB viously uh New
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh naswa has the uh NASA soup
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
kitchen and shelter uh which has 75 beds
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
um those beds are all full every night
 
02:08:35.229 --> 02:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
um this year um we also have in in naswa
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
a warming station which you can't sleep
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
there it's like tables in the cafeteria
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
at the Old El Street School building um
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
and that averages about 22 people a
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
night um we do know that in naswa 211
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
had over a 100 calls last year from you
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
aged 18 to 24 who are unable to find a
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
place to sleep for the night um and
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
those kids were not placed anywhere
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
because there's no longer a you shelter
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
in NWA so um that's just the data that I
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
have and hopefully it helps you when
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're making the decision on uh what
 
02:09:10.589 --> 02:09:10.599 align:start position:0%
the state can do to help this vulnerable
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
group thank you representative
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has a question uh
 
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um do you happen to
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
know um if there is a a depart
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
department or an element of DHHS that's
 
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh provide some sort of Regulation or
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
oversight to this particular shelter uh
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple of different ones um
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's managed through the normal cpsws in
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
the office um so usually it's the
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
permanency worker um so they have
 
02:09:43.229 --> 02:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
something called hope the housing and
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities to personally Excel
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
program um but again participants have
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
to follow a voluntary placement
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
agreement um and they can continue to
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
have an open case um those kids
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
typically stay in a foster home um
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
because they are only a couple of
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
independent living homes like the
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
Nashville Children's Home only has I
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
forget how many beds but it's less than
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
five um and then there's the after care
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
services um and those are both through
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
DCF yep all right I don't see any other
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
hands thank you very much now we have um
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%

again my name is Mandy Lancaster I am a
 
02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
social worker by trade I have worked in
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
Social Services for 20 years now 18 of
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
those years have been in New Hampshire I
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
do some adjunct work at the State
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
University um and I've worked at
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
Waypoint for over 10 years now and so
 
02:11:46.589 --> 02:11:46.599 align:start position:0%
Waypoint is one of New Hampshire's
 
02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
largest and oldest
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and we provide support
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
Supportive Services throughout the state
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to include supporting
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
Youth and Young adults experiencing
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
homelessness as well as young people in
 
02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
foster care that need therapeutic
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
supports core ordered and voluntary
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
community-based and home supports and
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
services and we also support folks in
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
their homes that um require our aged um
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors and um friends too and so the
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
state of homelessness in New Hampshire
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire coalition to end
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness indicated in their 2024
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
report that
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
52.1% there was a an increase of Youth
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the state by
 
02:12:43.549 --> 02:12:43.559 align:start position:0%
52.1% and um that also means that New
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire experienced the largest
 
02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
increase of Youth and Young Adult
 
02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the country and We
 
02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
Believe at Waypoint that early
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
intervention through programs like ours
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
are essential for reducing chronic
 
02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
homelessness which ultimately saves
 
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
public funds in the long run and a so a
 
02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
core Mission and objective of our
 
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
programs um through the homeless Youth
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
and Young Adult department is to
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
interrupt that experience of chronic
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness which I think we could
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
probably all agree um strains um people
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
and communities throughout our
 
02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
state last year the National Conference
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
of state legislators found that in the
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
US approximately 1 in 10 young adults
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 18 to 25 experien
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
homelessness and 1 and 30 between the
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
ages of 13 and
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
17 and in New Hampshire again
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
25% of the homeless population are those
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
at or under 25 years of age and one in
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
four reside in the city of
 
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester so we believe that shelter is
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
a part of the
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
solution um our demographic that we
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
provide services to at 298 Handover
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
Street are 18 to 24 year olds that are
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
fleeing domestic violence they're aging
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
out of foster care they're leaving
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
unsafe housing situations
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing um parental
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
incarceration parental death we see
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
often mental health issues not only for
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
the young person but what they're
 
02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
experiencing in their family
 
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
systems and so I would say those are the
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
biggest trends of young people that we
 
02:14:41.709 --> 02:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
see in our
 
02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
programs we are the only emergency
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
shelter for young people in New
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I appreciate that this
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
um um this request is Manchester based
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
we often see young people navigate
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
between Rochester Manchester and nashaa
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
those are the three communities that
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
young people um seem to have most
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
familiarity with and when young people
 
02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
are um disrupted and have no place um to
 
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
call home or no one to turn to they look
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
to what is familiar and something I'm
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
particularly proud of from a program
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
perspective is that this shelter is more
 
02:15:29.229 --> 02:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
than a bed so this isn't about providing
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
a cot and a meal for young people we the
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
the shelter is attached to an engagement
 
02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
Center and where it's a hub and it's a
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
hub and a pathway towards other
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
Supportive Services that include
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
Transitional Living programs
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
Transitional Living programs for
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
parenting and Pregnant young people we
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
have rapid rehousing programs we have
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
youth navigation and we even have three
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
rent controlled units on the top floor
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
of 298 Handover
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
Street um additionally and this really
 
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
speaks to the program part um moving
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
beyond this notion that shelter is a bed
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
I we have a myriad of life skills groups
 
02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:18.559 align:start position:0%
we have a professional um development
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
manager who works with young people to
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
promote access to work vocation even
 
02:16:31.549 --> 02:16:31.559 align:start position:0%
College um we're also we have other um
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
Folks collocate at the center to have
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
mental health needs met um and we also
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
provide parenting support and resources
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
by way of Our Family Resource Center and
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
so all of this is put in place towards
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
longer term
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
Solutions since the shelter opened it
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
has operated at capacity and has served
 
02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:56.910 align:start position:0%
has operated at capacity and has served
over

02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
340 youths through the dropin center and
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
177 youth at our emergency shelter on
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
average each night we turn away um
 
02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:10.599 align:start position:0%
upwards of 20 young people and we safety
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
plan with them and we call Community
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
Partners some young people stay in their
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and and so this really I
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
think think illustrates the need for
 
02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
emergency Sheltering for young people
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
throughout our
 
02:17:29.549 --> 02:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
state so I think as Illustrated the
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
shelter provides an essential benefit to
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
the individuals it supports or it it
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
serves but it also supports the
 
02:17:40.030 --> 02:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester Community um again the hope
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
and the objective is to decrease chronic
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness there is research that
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
indicates that when a young person
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
enters into an adult homeless service
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
system and um I have deep respect for
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
those that do that work that they are at
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
an exponential increased risk of
 
02:18:02.190 --> 02:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
experiencing chronic homelessness just
 
02:18:05.549 --> 02:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
by way of having close proximity to
 
02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
people that are already experiencing
 
02:18:07.719 --> 02:18:09.190 align:start position:0%
people that are already experiencing
chronic

02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
homelessness so too the shelter helps um
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
provide um or addresses the worker
 
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
shortages by improving Workforce
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
participation which is evidenced um by
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
way of our work with the professional
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
development and growth manager and it
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
helps address the um business
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
community's needs and reasonably their
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
concerns around um literal homelessness
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the impact that it has on business
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
because we provide um a space and an
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to engage young people so
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're not um interfering with business
 
02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.349 align:start position:0%
they're not um interfering with business
operations

02:18:52.349 --> 02:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
um by providing shelter and Supportive
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
Services we decrease the Reliance on
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
emergency service calls law enforcement
 
02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
um um with interaction with the criminal
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
justice system which reduces public
 
02:19:12.349 --> 02:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
spending in those
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
Arenas so I believe that this is a
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity for legislators

uh you know since you're asking for
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
specific or the bill asks for specific
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation what the budget is for
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
your facility I assume you're a
 
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and what your other sources of
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
revenue are yes I I can speak to that
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
generally and um executive director
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
borha Alvarez de Toledo can certainly
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
speak to it with more definitiveness
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
um in the homeless Youth and Young Adult
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
Department we rely heavily on federal
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
pass through dollars from the Family
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Bureau which is embedded
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
within the larger DHHS landscape we are
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
also a recipient of Hud funding and have
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
a number of programs that
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
um were supported through HUD uh a bulk
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
of our dollars comes from charitable
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
giving and our aggressive
 
02:20:56.429 --> 02:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
fundraising efforts annually and so it
 
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
really is a public private
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
partnership and with all of the income
 
02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
and the revenue coming in we still have
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
a shortfall to operate the shelter there
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
are no clear um avenues for supporting a
 
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
shelter such as ours adult shelter beds
 
02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
are um um by bed night and we operate a
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
a program that's beyond beds so that we
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
can help young people um move so that
 
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
homelessness for young people is brief
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and non reoccurring and to again meet
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
that objective of reducing chronic
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
homelessness does that
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
help uh it it does um uh you know I do
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
have question follow this yes is this
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir um just just you
 
02:21:54.030 --> 02:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
know o overall how much money flows
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
through the organization if somebody
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
else was better to answer that that's
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay too that would definitely be the Ed
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
we're a large nonprofit and there are
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
multiple departments in the agency so I
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
would feel better for him to defer to
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
borha thank
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%

chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for the
 
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
outstanding service that you do for the
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester and for the State of
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you I am a resident
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I see what you are doing do you have
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
any figures that shows how you have
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
reduced The
 
02:22:44.110 --> 02:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
Chronic homelessness through your
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
programs to through the youths that
 
02:22:49.950 --> 02:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
enter your shelter and the engagement
 
02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:51.070 align:start position:0%
enter your shelter and the engagement
facility

02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
how many of those are now productive
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire at this point
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
I can't give you a number I can speak
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
anecdotally and I would be happy to loop
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
back around and thank you for the
 
02:23:08.429 --> 02:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
question and so um there are young
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
people that enter into college we had at
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
least five this year that we helped set
 
02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
them up in their dorm rooms we have 20
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
rapid rehousing beds throughout the
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
state we have three Beach Street units
 
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
and we also have um upwards of 20
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
Transitional Living Spaces and five nine
 
02:23:33.710 --> 02:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
units for transitional living for
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant and parenting and we also work
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
closely with the division um DHHS to
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
connect young people to FYI vouchers and
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
those are vouchers for young people
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
exiting foster care um there's a
 
02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:51.030 align:start position:0%
exiting foster care um there's a
bottleneck

02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
bottleneck
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
and so we the engagement Center and the
 
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
shelter and the programming is vitally
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
important because we connect young
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
people to those programs and other
 
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
programs throughout the state that have
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
youth specific Housing Programs
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
um I hope that helps
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative run thank you Mr
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for all the great work you
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
do my question is with this 500,000 for
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
each of the two years the B Anum how
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
much of that would be going to uh a
 
02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
fixed cost outlay for instance beds
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
things like that rather than um ongoing
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
something like I guess what I'm trying
 
02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
to get at is uh in two years would you
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
find you would need at least this amount
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
of money to maintain
 
02:24:46.990 --> 02:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
operations or to augment your operations
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um it would certainly the two Fe
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
would be vital in augmenting operations
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
and there is a fear that if we don't
 
02:24:59.309 --> 02:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
identify ongoing support that we would
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
look at closure much like our friends in
 
02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
nashaa which I think would be quite
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
devastating for young people in our
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
state um and it would at least give us
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
two years to continue to do some
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
additional sustainability planning and I
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
believe that borha could um contribute
 
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
to that question question as
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
well all right one problem okay thank
 
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
you and then uh you mentioned about the
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy um young parenting support
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
that you give to these youth how many of
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
the um youth that or the young adults
 
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
that come in are have children that go
 
02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
that come with them or babies many many
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
we have a play pen in the Drop in Center
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
um in the shelter young people can stay
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
and we have had young people stay and
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
until they delivered their children and
 
02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't have anyone to go with them
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
and were quite literally in the delivery
 
02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
room um with some young people and um we
 
02:26:05.710 --> 02:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
because we have the case management
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
staff and the life skills groups and the
 
02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
parenting groups we um work with those
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
young people to plan prior proper
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
planning so one specific youth that I'm
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
thinking of was able to transition into
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
to her own apartment from the hospital
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
and another into our Transitional Living
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
Program for pregnant and parenting young
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
people okay we certainly are seeing an
 
02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
increase in um pregnancy and young
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
babies in the center thank you
 
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative Edwards uh yeah thank
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um so you sound like your
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
mission is extremely similar similar to
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
The Liberty house I don't know if you
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
know the Liberty house model but I was
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
on the board of directors for them for
 
02:26:59.630 --> 02:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
three years and so I I really admire and
 
02:27:02.269 --> 02:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
respect and want to uh I'm biased to
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to support your program because
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's vital but um so this
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
this bill will end up going to division
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
three so there's some time to think
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
about this but what I'm what I'm really
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
curious about and interested in on your
 
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
behalf is is that um
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
you all are put into a sustainable
 
02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
framework right now it feels like you're
 
02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
a little autonomous like very autonomous
 
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
given that you're coming to us on a
 
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
one-time shot for the first round of
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
funding so so I'd like to see what your
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
proposal is for getting into a
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
sustainable model Liberty house went to
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
Catholic Charities other organizations
 
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
become affiliated with DHHS funding
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
systems and and and so so if you would
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
help me understand um that if if we were
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
to put money into you that it's
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable and that you have a a
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
framework for the future and and that's
 
02:28:07.469 --> 02:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
a lot for today but we you you have time
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
to think about that yeah that is a big
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
and good question and thank you for that
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
um what I do know is that um many of our
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
neighboring states throughout New
 
02:28:27.389 --> 02:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
England I believe all of them have
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
some um have legislation on the books
 
02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
some form of runaway and homeless youth
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
act in which their
 
02:28:41.469 --> 02:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS um systems provide ongoing support
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
to run to to homeless Youth and Young
 
02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
to run to to homeless Youth and Young
adults

02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
adults
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
um as an important prevention strategy
 
02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
to again
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
address chronic homelessness later
 
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that we're there yet and
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think that borha can speak to some of
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
this as well but without a doubt it
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
would seem as though there will need to
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
be a private
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
partner um a um a
 
02:29:19.870 --> 02:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
partnership you know in my perfect world
 
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
um um moving forward and to to recognize
 
02:29:26.830 --> 02:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
that you know up to 40% of young people
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing chronic homelessness have
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
been involved in child welfare so um so
 
02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
response does does your colleague wish
 
02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:47.630 align:start position:0%
response does does your colleague wish
to

02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%

for the record my name because it's a
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
hard one so I I recognize is borha
 
02:30:29.269 --> 02:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
alvare too and I have the privilege of
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
serving as CEO of Waypoint and have for
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
the last 11 years um I'm going to try to
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
sort of give a context about sort of
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
financially how we have sustained um the
 
02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
shelter but also what we're facing going
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
forward um about five years ago when we
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
had an internal meeting with Senior
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
Management to really determine whether
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
or not we were providing the services
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
that the youth experience um
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness needed the
 
02:30:59.309 --> 02:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
number one question is we we don't have
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
an emergency shelter that's a crucial
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
piece of a Continuum of Care for any
 
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
system and actually New Hampshire was
 
02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
the only New England State without a
 
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
specified um emergency shelter for youth
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
um we we knew we couldn't come to the
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
state and say would you fund this um
 
02:31:19.389 --> 02:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
trust me we had tried um it was a
 
02:31:22.349 --> 02:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
complicated thing um so we embarked in a
 
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
capital campaign and raised $2.5 million
 
02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
to actually build a number of things but
 
02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
$1.7 million were to build the shelter
 
02:31:34.910 --> 02:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
um that Mandy Lancaster has told you
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
about it's the building on 298 um
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hanover Street which used to be the New
 
02:31:42.429 --> 02:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Works site in um and actually
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
was owned by the state so actually we
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
bought that from the state I um
 
02:31:48.389 --> 02:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
innocently went to governor sununu and
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
asked if he could give me the the
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
building and he says you have to
 
02:31:54.190 --> 02:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
convince 400 legislators I'm like okay
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'll figure it out so um in anyway I um
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
we bought and renovated the building um
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
and it's been operating as a shelter um
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
as as Mandy has shared with you
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
basically on the first week uh the
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
shelter was full all the beds were full
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
but we did not have operational money we
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
knew we needed two staff from 700 p.m.
 
02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
to 7:00 a.m. every single night 3 65 and
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
a supervisor um and so I actually went
 
02:32:27.269 --> 02:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
to um meet with governor sununu and said
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
this is the predicament we've actually
 
02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
built this we need fundings to operate
 
02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
this shelter um he was incredibly
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
supportive and actually very grateful
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we had actually undertaken this
 
02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
funding and this building and he knew
 
02:32:42.910 --> 02:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
the agency well because actually
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
Governor sonono has participated three
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
years in our major fundraiser which is
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
the sleepout where the business
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
community um and leaders um actually
 
02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
sleep in the cold in March to raise
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
awareness and funds and last year we
 
02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:57.150 align:start position:0%
awareness and funds and last year we
raised

02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
$400,000 um so he knew our programs well
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
and said I'm going to I'm going to
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
support uh with $500,000 a year this
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
this was in the last budget cycle I
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
received notification from his office
 
02:33:12.030 --> 02:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
that um he had actually increased the
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
line for homeless and shelter Services I
 
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
believe it went up uh three times to
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
about $10 million what he didn't do
 
02:33:22.990 --> 02:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
though is um say that half um half a
 
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
million of those 500,000 would be um ear
 
02:33:27.389 --> 02:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
marked if you want or dedicated to
 
02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
Waypoint so when it came to the
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
they released a request for proposal and
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
it was really a funding um sort of a
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
more traditional shelter which is based
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
on volume so I think the rate was
 
02:33:45.870 --> 02:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
$18.50 per bed uh per night uh for us
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
with 14 beds that might work for a
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
shelter that has 150 but as Mandy has
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
explained this is way more than a bed we
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
have intensive case management we follow
 
02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
um the youth uh and actually transition
 
02:34:00.429 --> 02:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
then to A Drop in Center so it was going
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
to be about $92,000 and we knew by then
 
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
that the operations was about $600,000
 
02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
to fund the shelter
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
um we were a little desperate because we
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
had open the shelter and in three months
 
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
we were facing closing it so I actually
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
went and met with uh commissioner Weaver
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
and Deputy Commissioner hen and said
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
we believe um Governor sununu really
 
02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
intended to put this money and to
 
02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
support the shelter um the way it's it's
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually being rolled out is not going
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
to help us um I knew there were meetings
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
between the department and governor
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
sununu and um the commissioner came and
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
actually visited the the the center uh
 
02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
with Deputy Commissioner hen and they
 
02:34:43.269 --> 02:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
realized that this is not funding a bet
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
this is funding a whole intervention for
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
youth um they were able to secure half a
 
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars $500,000 for 18 months
 
02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
which was not enough to fund the full
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
shelter but we committed to keep the
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
doors open and we really committed also
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
to fund raise for the difference um to
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that we had the shelter
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
operating at capacity over night um it
 
02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
also gave us 18 months and the idea was
 
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
that the state was going to figure out
 
02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
how to put in uh this bium budget um you
 
02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
know funding for the shelter because
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
they recognize that it is the only
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
shelter for youth in New Hampshire and
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's actually a service that is
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
needed um unfortunately um it has not
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
made it to effic to the efficiency
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
budget um it is um listed as a
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
priority we are very aware of the fiscal
 
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
climate and position that the state is
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
and are very very worried that it's not
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to make it into the budget and
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
what it will mean is July 1st we have no
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
funding uh at all for um the shelter and
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
we will be forced to put potentially
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
close it now the whole division of um um
 
02:35:58.510 --> 02:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
runaway and homeless youth services that
 
02:36:01.269 --> 02:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
um was described uh by my colleague
 
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
Mandy is about $4 and5 million dollar in
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
services and as she um alluded to um we
 
02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
receive most of the funding uh from
 
02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
federal funds um the only funding that
 
02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
we have received from the state is that
 
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
bridge money half a million dollars for
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
the 18 months and we have to raise every
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
single year to support These funds
 
02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
because they have match we the these
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
Federal contracts have match we have to
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
raise $1.2
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
million and we have been committed to
 
02:36:32.269 --> 02:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
doing this through various ways we have
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
had support from foundations actually
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
one of the funding for the shelter was
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh through um Senator Shaheen um you
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
know congressionally directed support um
 
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
and of through Hut through the city of
 
02:36:48.269 --> 02:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester so um adding another half a
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars are actually six 00,000
 
02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
to um our portfolio having to raise
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
money is is not something that we can do
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
um and we feel that two and a half years
 
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the the um shelter has really worked
 
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
and helped many many youth um and we
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
just want to turn to the state to say we
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
we need your help in supporting this we
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
have actually carried this uh through
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
fundraising and many of the services and
 
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
that is certainly the expectation um
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
that we have of the community Mee um I I
 
02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
just want to say that there's um um
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
mayor um Jay R from Manchester has
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
actually submitted a letter of support I
 
02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if he had emailed the letter
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
to you or I was supposed to print it so
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have it but I will get to all of
 
02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
you uh the mayor has actually visited
 
02:37:39.550 --> 02:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
the shelter and has been extremely
 
02:37:41.550 --> 02:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
supportive of the services understanding
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we are the only provider that does
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
this emergency shelter in Manchester
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
which is absolutely
 
02:37:50.429 --> 02:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
needed um
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop here because there were a
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that were sort of like
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know punted to me so I'm sure
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
there's uh questions representative
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
Edwards very question uh thank you very
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
much I I'm I'm taking puzzle pieces here
 
02:38:06.429 --> 02:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm this is what I think I've
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
put together from your testimony and
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
others and Miss Fox maybe maybe you can
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
clarify this for us but it sounds to me
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
like uh Waypoint has visibility within
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
Services that the managers of uh the
 
02:38:25.469 --> 02:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate family and youth services
 
02:38:30.269 --> 02:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
programs are are aware of of you uh are
 
02:38:32.429 --> 02:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
predisposed to wanting to work with you
 
02:38:35.469 --> 02:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
and to help you uh but in this budget
 
02:38:38.590 --> 02:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
process they couldn't find room in in
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
their their efficiency budget and so the
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
from their perspective they put Waypoint
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
into a a priority need category so so
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
when the the governor's budget comes to
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
us we're going to be seeing a a
 
02:38:57.389 --> 02:38:57.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized need for for Waypoint and
 
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's too much government
 
02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy for you but I that is my
 
02:39:02.910 --> 02:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
understanding as well this is how it's
 
02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
going but at the same time yeah I am
 
02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
hearing that um because of the
 
02:39:10.510 --> 02:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
situations are now it's not clear that
 
02:39:11.790 --> 02:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
many of that
 
02:39:15.790 --> 02:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized so follow up so so so I
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
think the conclusion to that is that
 
02:39:21.150 --> 02:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is a supplemental Bill to
 
02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
augment the activities of what DHHS is
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
doing through the budget process it's
 
02:39:27.469 --> 02:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
not that you were forgotten or
 
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
overlooked it's just that uh people are
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
so concerned about your program that
 
02:39:34.269 --> 02:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
they've provided us with the
 
02:39:37.630 --> 02:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
supplemental Bill to consider that is
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
really a good summary uh we are
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
continuing to work with the budget
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
process and certainly our hope is the
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the new governor puts it in but we
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
also want some assurances and actually
 
02:39:51.469 --> 02:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
to share with the committee that
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise we will not have a shelter and
 
02:39:56.429 --> 02:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
cannot operate the shelter outstanding
 
02:39:58.269 --> 02:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you sir and and thank
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%

retired private citizen enjoying
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
retirement but enjoying being here as
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
well uh but I know it's lunchtime and
 
02:40:41.630 --> 02:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'll move I'll move along quickly for 47
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
years I was an attorney at New Hampshire
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
legal assistance uh the last decade or
 
02:40:48.429 --> 02:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
so decade or so I was a director of
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
housing Justice
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh I have and again especially over the
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
last decade SE had countless young
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
clients who had such an array of
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
problems that are uh addressed in one
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
way or another uh by the shelter uh I
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
had clients who couldn't obtain housing
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
because of certain deficits and problems
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
in their past uh slews of eviction cases
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
where they're getting evicted for all
 
02:41:21.389 --> 02:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
sorts of problems whether many of which
 
02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
around substance abuse but some not even
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
being able to budget to pay their rent
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get jobs they couldn't
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
keep jobs um they couldn't get
 
02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation because they'd
 
02:41:35.710 --> 02:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
get fired from jobs they couldn't get
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
local welfare assistance because they
 
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't deal with all the
 
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy uh many were deest domestic
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
violence victims already in their young
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
lives um a number of uh young pregnant
 
02:41:50.110 --> 02:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
women with nowhere to go
 
02:41:52.030 --> 02:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh and people who got kicked out young
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
people who got kicked out of
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
conventional shelters because they're
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
really no good places for young people
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
um all of these people uh could benefit
 
02:42:07.389 --> 02:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
enormously from the services that are
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
offered uh by the shelter uh and I'll
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
just add one other thing I think to the
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
extent that they there were certain
 
02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
services available to them other than
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
housing the fact that they're um not
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
offered by the state is really helpful
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
and encouraging to people who have grown
 
02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:30.760 align:start position:0%

I'm here today to speak in support of
 
02:44:06.190 --> 02:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
519 in relation to the Waypoint Youth
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
and Young Adult shelter uh I want to
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
emphasize the relationship between
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
housing stability and good mental health
 
02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
as a critical social determinant of
 
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
Health uh stable housing
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
is an important protective factor for
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
the mental health of all people for
 
02:44:24.990 --> 02:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
those with mental health condition
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
specifically uh stable housing is an
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
important tool to Aid in their recovery
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
further a lack of stable housing can
 
02:44:34.830 --> 02:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
contribute to stress anxiety other
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
symptoms of poor mental health and at
 
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
the same time a serious mental health
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
condition can make it harder to get and
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
maintain housing and we can see the
 
02:44:45.150 --> 02:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
direct impacts of this as about one in
 
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
five individuals experiencing
 
02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the US have a serious
 
02:44:50.269 --> 02:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
mental health condition
 
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
so for Youth and Young adults
 
02:44:52.830 --> 02:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness in New
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including those who have a
 
02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosed mental health condition way
 
02:44:58.190 --> 02:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
points emergency homeless shelter is an
 
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
invaluable program you've heard the
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
specific details of what is provided
 
02:45:03.790 --> 02:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
there so I won't go into that but I did
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
did just want to again emphasize that
 
02:45:07.710 --> 02:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
this is a safe space for Youth and Young
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
adults experiencing homelessness that
 
02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
connects them to Services tailored to
 
02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
their needs without this shelter Youth
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
and Young adults in Manchester and
 
02:45:17.389 --> 02:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the state will lose access to
 
02:45:19.349 --> 02:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
those important Services prep uating
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
their homelessness and jeopardizing
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
their mental health and wellness for
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
those reasons n New Hampshire asks the
 
02:45:26.349 --> 02:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
committee to vote ought to pass on House
 
02:45:30.150 --> 02:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.429 --> 02:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
time um all right question here from um
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
representative hackins Phillips thank
 
02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for taking my questions
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
Mr Hawkins
 
02:45:42.479 --> 02:45:43.990 align:start position:0%
Mr Hawkins
um

02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
my constant question throughout today's
 
02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
testimony is what happens when these
 
02:45:50.670 --> 02:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
shelters close and I think that question
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
is particularly important for the Mental
 
02:45:55.630 --> 02:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
Health Community could you elaborate to
 
02:45:57.590 --> 02:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
the members of our committee what will
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
happen to the youth struggling with
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
mental um crises um who are currently
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
served by the shelter and Resource
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
Center if it were to close absolutely I
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question so obviously
 
02:46:11.150 --> 02:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
they will lose access to the services
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
provided directly by the shelter um so
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
they will lose access to those Case
 
02:46:17.150 --> 02:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
Management Services they'll lose access
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the safe space the social
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are provided at the
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
shelter that are good for their mental
 
02:46:24.269 --> 02:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
health uh at the same time we know
 
02:46:25.870 --> 02:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
without housing it is hard to maintain
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
treatment it is hard to maintain
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
medication if you're having if you are
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
on medication uh we know that um if you
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
are experiencing homelessness and you
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
have a mental health condition you may
 
02:46:37.710 --> 02:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
be more likely to be hospitalized you
 
02:46:39.309 --> 02:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
may be more likely to have interactions
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
with the criminal justice system and
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
that is all what we are very concerned
 
02:46:44.110 --> 02:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
about what this uh if this shelter is to
 
02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:45.230 align:start position:0%
about what this uh if this shelter is to
go

02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:46:48.910 --> 02:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
away one followup thank you um thank you
 
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
for that explanation and I'm
 
02:46:53.710 --> 02:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
specifically concerned about um the men
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
um mental health institutional support
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
that would be required to pick up the
 
02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
slack in this instant do you know what
 
02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
our state offers currently for youth um
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
who are struggling with mental health
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
crises that do not have opportunities at
 
02:47:11.469 --> 02:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
the shelter now where do they go uh that
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the followup that is a a
 
02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
large question obviously there are a lot
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
of services available throughout the
 
02:47:19.150 --> 02:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
state I think our largest concern uh
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
would be the escalation of what services
 
02:47:24.469 --> 02:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
they are pushed into should their mental
 
02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
health condition progress become more
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
severe they are pushed into more
 
02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive forms of care rather than
 
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
the community community based care that
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
they may access at lower levels of
 
02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
Acuity um would be our main
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
concern right thank you Mr Haw thank you
 
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:56.429 --> 02:47:56.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will also be uh
 
02:47:58.429 --> 02:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
exceptionally brief I just want to uh
 
02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Emma savini I

Futures is here in strong support of
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 519 um specifically because
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
it would help mitigate adverse childhood
 
02:48:12.990 --> 02:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
experiences which can be associated with
 
02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh poor health and mental health
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
outcomes adverse childhood experiences
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
or Aces have severe consequences during
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
and throughout adulthood um Aces have
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
been linked to things such as mental
 
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
illness substance misuse um health
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
concerns such as chronic uh back pain
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
heart problems um
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
diabetes and have long-term
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
consequences when um a young person or
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
youth experiences
 
02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness that housing instability is
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
just one ace but can contribute to other
 
02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
Aces as well um youth youth experiencing
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
homelessness are also more more likely
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
to have caregivers who are experiencing
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
mental illness which is another Ace um
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
or um have caregivers who are
 
02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
experiencing substance use disorder um
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
which is also an
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
ace um further the effect of poverty and
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
instable housing due to Poverty is um a
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
compounding impact has a compounding
 
02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
impact on Aces um and in New Hampshire
 
02:49:24.030 --> 02:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
youth ages 18 to 24 11% of them lived in
 
02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
poverty in
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
2023 um the good news is that ases are
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
not Resolute so there are mitigating
 
02:49:33.790 --> 02:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
factors and protective factors such as
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
provision of stable housing that can
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
help mitigate those long-term and really
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
dangerous Health consequences from Aces
 
02:49:42.990 --> 02:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
um I want to underscore how important
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
the Waypoint shelter is at providing one
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
of those protected factors by providing
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh stable housing to Children um Youth
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
and Young adults in our
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
community um without the Waypoint
 
02:49:57.630 --> 02:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
shelter New Futures concern is that
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
these Aces will continue to compound
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
resulting in longer term more dangerous
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
Health consequences which are both
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the individual but costly
 
02:50:10.229 --> 02:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
to our state um for those reasons new
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
Futures urges this uh body to vote uh
 
02:50:15.630 --> 02:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on house built 519 and I'm
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.750 --> 02:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
don't see any thank you very much for
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
coming and um does the department want
 
02:50:29.710 --> 02:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
to wait for division 3 or come speak now
 
02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.990 --> 02:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
Fox good afternoon for the record I'm
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
Kati Fox I'm the director of the
 
02:50:41.389 --> 02:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health and I do
 
02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
not want to be the person who drags this
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
out so that I think the worst people
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
think about is after lunch before lunch
 
02:50:53.710 --> 02:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
is much worse so I will um just let you
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
know that the department is in support
 
02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill and I have noted the
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions that um will certainly be
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
addressed in division 3 and I all um
 
02:51:08.710 --> 02:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
just as a a preview to that um we want
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
you to understand where this fits in our
 
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
um system and where it fits for our
 
02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
mission zero which is to reduce the um
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the Ed boarding the emergency
 
02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
department boarding of individuals in
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
need of a psychiatric bed um and where
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
that fits in in our um Mission zero work
 
02:51:32.309 --> 02:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
and also in our children's system of
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
care so we can talk more about it on
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at 11: uh and I look forward to
 
02:51:38.830 --> 02:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
that and if there are additional
 
02:51:42.229 --> 02:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
questions be happy to be prepared to um
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I don't see any hands so we will
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on 519 after we
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%

1:10 so people can stretch their legs
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
