We'll open up the subcommittee work session on Senate bill 235.

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
And just to review.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Representative Terry's not here.

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Representative Post is here.

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,000
And let's see, uh, Sally Hunt here.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Calabro is here.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And okay, so Representative Patusek is sitting in for Terry.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
No, that makes us even.

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:25,000
we're all set okay um so uh as my understanding is that everybody would much rather have this problem solved at the insurance department level and so we're we're very confident that that discussion is going on and it will occur.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And so if we retain this bill, we'll get an update come this fall.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,500
And hopefully the issues have been resolved.

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
So I will make a motion to retain.

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Second.

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
So you don't have to worry.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Jack was Guthrie.

110
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500

Petrie who did you say was sitting in for you're singing for macular but didn't you give us another name for uh oh we misunderstood joe guthrie uh no that's john uh oh i'm sorry yeah never mind all right okay okay so it doesn't matter we got a pairing at the moment okay well no guthrie is he moment we're missing a damn because vincent's not here right and we're missing guthrie.

124
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,000
We just lost the door.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Make it even.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,500
And so we have parity.

127
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
At this moment, we have parity.

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Is Vincent coming?

129
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,000
We can only assume he's supposed to be here.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So at this moment, this is like the old days.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We would just call it pairing.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Senate used to do this all the time.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm going to work from the exec list.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:31,000
first up is uh senate bill 21 relative to the due date and delivery of monthly reports and fees to the liquor commission who would like to make the motion don't all speak at once okay okay Okay.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,500
So, Representative Burroughs, seconded by Representative Patusek, Moosa ought to pass.

138
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
And Patusek.

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Representative Burroughs, do you want to speak to your motion?

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500

Representative Burroughs, do you want to speak to your motion?

I see this somewhat of a housekeeping bill.

144
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:11,000
It's relative to the due date and delivery of monthly reports and fees to the Liquor Commission, and I don't think it was terribly controversial.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We passed it in subcommittee 5-0.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay.

Representative Gibbs?

784
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes.

785
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Representative Speer?

786
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000

787
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes.

788
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000

18 to zip.

793
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Okay.

794
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Vote 18 to zip.

795
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
All Senate Bill 243, all those in favor of placing 243 on the consent calendar, please say aye.

796
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Aye.

797
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Oh, 235.

798
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Never mind.

799
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Never mind.

800
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I keep running down on my checklist here.

801
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,500
I've got to put more space in the street.

802
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Okay.

803
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:41,000
Now, Senate Bill 243, establishing a committee to study the implementation of a state-based health insurance exchange.

804
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,500
And Representative Speer, seconded by Representative Batusek, moves inexpedient to legislate.

805
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,500
And Representative Speer is recognized to speak to our motion.

806
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:03,500
This bill would establish a committee to study the implementation of a state-based exchange as opposed to the federal-based exchange that we currently have.

807
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:13,500
And we heard a lot of stuff in committee that explained why that may not be such a great idea.

808
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,500
So we voted to ITL it.

809
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Fair enough.

810
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Any other discussion on the motion to inexpedient legislate on 243?

811
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

Representative Lane.

840
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500

Representative Spear.

844
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000

845
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000

Yes.

848
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay.

849
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,500
Motion passes 18 to zip.

850
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:13,500
All those in favor of placing Senate Bill 243 on the consent calendar, please say aye.

851
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Aye.

852
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Those opposed?

853
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
So moved unanimously.

854
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:29,000
Senate Bill 198, directing the Insurance Department to conduct a cost study providing coverage for certain reproductive health care.

855
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:43,500
So the game plan is that we would retain this bill and that we would ask the Insurance Department to do a cost analysis on this piece of legislation.

856
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Representative Filiad is still not happy.

857
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Go ahead.

858
00:44:48,500 --> 00:45:04,500
I do want to be on the record making an ought to pass motion on this because I believe it is important for LGBTQ couples to receive equity and their health care.

859
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Okay.

860
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:13,500
Well, we're going to uh you can vote down vote against the retain motion.

861
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:19,500
But you obviously would argue that we should take a different motion.

862
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:35,500
I would argue that we should take a different motion against the retain motion since for the reasons that I've argued previously that LGBTQ couples should receive equity in their health care.

863
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:44,000
No, I realize that, but that's why you would urge people to vote against the retained motion.

864
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,500
That's exactly why I would urge people to vote against the retained motion.

865
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,000
I want to be on the record for that.

866
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Perfect.

867
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And you are.

868
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You will be.

869
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,500
Okay, so the motion is to retain.

870
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
I have a question.

871
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Yes, Representative Speer.

872
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:56,000
I went back and looked at the video actually i want to first i want to get a second on the motion i want to get first to accept so uh i make the retain motion and second by representative patousek okay yes now you can so i went back and looked at the video and there was a lawyer I don't remember her name, but she very clearly and concisely put together the whole crux of the problem and said very focused or pretty concisely what it is that the bill wanted to find.

873
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:09,500
And so my question is, if we did retain it, can we turn this thing into a law, into a legislation as opposed to a study committee?

874
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:25,000
Because if we just took her words, we would have the legislation that this thing is going for rather than spend however many months it takes to do a study committee.

875
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So basically by our retaining, we will revisit this issue come September.

876
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And at that point in time, it could be turned into anything you want to turn it into.

877
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Yes, because we would then, just for your new members, remind you that we will come back in the fall and have our three divisions.

878
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:59,000
We'll take up the bills that were retained within them and discuss them.

879
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:26,500
And at that in time you the pending uh pending motions can be passing it amending it uh and uh but you would not be able to retain it again you could interim study it and the difference being where uh the interim study motion would come to the House floor and would be debated.

880
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Theoretically.

881
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Okay.

882
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
All right.

883
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,500
So the pending motion is to retain Senate Bill 243.

884
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Representative Ammon.

885
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Excuse me.

886
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,000
Did I do it again?

887
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Senate Bill 198.

888
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yes.

889
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000

Yes.

893

Representative Burroughs.

894
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
No.

895
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Representative Herbert.

896
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
No.

897
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Representative Lane.

898
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000

Representative Filio.

905
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
No.

906
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
Representative Gibbs.

907
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Yes.

908
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Representative Filio?

909
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
No.

910
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Representative Gibbs?

911
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500

912
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Representative Spear?

Yes.

918
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,000
That is 13 to 5.

919
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,500
13 to 5 to retain.

920
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Okay.

921
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Moving on.

922
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,000
Senate Bill 201 relative to resale of event tickets.

923
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I thought we were going to retain this one, right?

924
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,500
Anybody want to make the motion to retain it?

925
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Okay, Representative Ammon second.

00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,500
No, no, no, we can't pass this bill.

928
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500

But it was Representative Gibbs who pointed out that, you know, this happens every day when it comes to hotels.

931
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:18,000
I mean, if we're going to solve a problem for one, how are you going to solve it for everybody, right?

00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
There you go.

1003

All right.

1004
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Any discussion on the motion to do this?

1005
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:29,000
And basically, by doing this, we will send a memo to the Insurance Department, and they have already hired, they already have a consultant in mind who will be doing this financial analysis.

1006
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000

I missed something on that one.

1013
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,500
Do we do another line for this?

1014
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,500
No, you don't have to worry.

1015
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
Well, we just did.

1016
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,000

1021
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:38,500
Relative to financial transactions involving the liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer in which the Federal Home Loan Bank is a party.

1022
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,000
Anybody want to make the motions on this one?

1023
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Who are the sponsors?

1024
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Okay.

1025
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000

1026
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And Representative Patusek, second.

1027
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
O Patusek, yes, ought to pass.

1028
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000

And I remember I had a...

1030
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,500
Yes, we had the bank.

1031
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,000

1032
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Any turns?

1033
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Any turns?

1034
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I guess not.

1035
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Okay.

1036
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,500
Yeah, so this is clarification.

1037
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,500
You know, is this more of an insurance?

1038
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,000
And they just left the room, right?

1039
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000

00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's 402C.

1042
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's definitely an insurance.

1043
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Okay.

1044
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
This was a request by the insurance department.

1045
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Okay.

1046
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,500
So there'll be no problems with it.

1047
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,000
No problems with this, right?

1048
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Okay.

1049
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000

1091
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:25,000
uh senate bill 37 establishing committee to study the hospitality and tourism education in New Hampshire representative spear represent spears second by representative to sake moves in expedient to legislate and representative spears recognizes speak to her motion.

1092
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,000
This bill would have established a commission to study hospitality and tourism education in New Hampshire.

1093
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:45,000
We've had several bills in the past this session come through various committees on the House that have turned these kinds of things down.

1094
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's a study that, as we heard from the witnesses at the hearing, they have already been working these issues.

1095
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
The various hotels have worked things with people living in the areas.

1096
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,500
They've talked to colleges already.

1097
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:09,500
It doesn't need legislation to get involved in the middle of that.

1098
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:17,500
They already seem to have a good handle on what they're doing, on what they need.

1099
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:27,500
And it should be a discussion between the hospitality groups and the universities without us in the middle of it.

1100
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Fair enough.

1101
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:34,500
Any other discussion on the motion of inexperience to legislate?

1102
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:51,000

Thank you.

1318

Thank you.

Thank you.

1321

Thank you.

1322
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,500
Thank you.

1323
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,500
Thank you.

1324
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,500
Thank you.

1325
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
Thank you.

1326
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Thank you.

1327
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,500
Thank you.

1328
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Thank you.

1329
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Thank you.

1330
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,500
Thank you.

1331
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
Thank you.

1332
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Thank you.

1333
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Thank you.

1334
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
Thank you.

1335
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,500
Okay.

1336
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,500
Okay.

1337
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:04,500
I'd like to open up the executive session at Senate Bill 180.

1338
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:11,000
So I would like to make a motion to retain Senate Bill 180.

1339
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Second.

1340
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Why?

1341
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Representative Gibbs seconded.

1342
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Representative Gibbs seconded.

1343
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Okay.

1344
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So, before, we don't even have to talk about the amendments, because obviously the underlying bill needs to be amended anyways with a .3.

1345
01:09:33,000 --> 01:10:07,000
But at this point, the problem I'm kind of, that I was dealing with in my mind was when we passed this in the subcommittee, that we said we were going to be okay with the bill, we were conscious of the fact that in Senate Bill, excuse me, House Bill 639, we had a study committee to study the issue of this Delta 8 and Delta 9.

1346
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And I sense from everybody that there's a little stress on whether 659 is actually going to live another day.

1347
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And therefore, if it really wasn't going to pass, if it's not going to pass, then we really shouldn't be passing this because the study committee won't occur.

1348
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So we could, you know, so I said, well, we need to study this.

1349
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:54,500
So we could put this off and we can amend it to have a study committee to address this Delta 8, Delta 9, and whatever, how much THC is actually really in it.

1350
01:10:54,500 --> 01:11:00,000
I mean, 0.3 seems like a pretty small number to me.

1351
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And it's compared to the 0.05 that we have in non-alcoholic beer.

1352
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,500
And so therefore it really isn't marijuana because of the 0.3.

1353
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:21,500
And so I'm just thinking that at the end of the day we really don't need to pass this bill.

1354
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:30,500
And the right answer is for us at this point to just retain it and live another day.

1355
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,500
So Representative Spears first.

1356
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:41,500
The only comment I have is we can't pass it the way it is because it's still wrong.

1357
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Perfect.

1358
01:11:43,500 --> 01:14:29,500
It says 0.3 percent greater than 0.3 percent and needs to say less than 0.3% otherwise it makes no sense this is the amendment the amendment is i i i guess i would i would have to say i disagree the idea is that um see if it's oh i see you're right yeah because i forgot this you're right it it should be less than you're right okay yes as per your email which representative selen though it seems to me that we were in agreement that this should pass because the idea of like there being zero regulation on something and and these these uh cbd oils can be turned into thc products delta nines or i don't know much about this stuff but it sounded to me like even if we can't get 639 which had a study committee this might have maybe made a study committee unnecessary maybe I mean in reality it sounds like this might be the solution the reality is anybody can go buy something there's no ID checks there's no regulation of of how it's produced how it's tested what it actually is that to me seems like an issue that we should address uh retaining it I don't know what the point is aside from maybe we're just I don't know I don't know what the goal is if it's like leverage to try to get 639 but i don't know if that would work because the senate seems to be kind of stubborn on this but it doesn't mean that this is a bad bill i think that this seems like a good bill from my understanding and i i think we should pass it because i think it's we're here to try to make things a little it better and i don't think a free-for-all on this, on vaping various types of THC, Delta 9, and these Delta letters after them is something that most people even understand is actually happening.

1359
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,500
I was surprised to learn that.

1360
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:39,000
So you would be okay if it was someone who was over 21?

1361
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
What's that?

1362
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
An age requirement.

1363
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,500
Yeah, I mean, that's fine.

1364
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,500
Whatever.

1365
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,500
Right.

1366
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:56,500
So I'm saying the problem with this bill was it was banning it altogether.

1367
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:03,500
So if we retain it, we could, come September, pass it with just 21.

1368
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Okay.

1369
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,500
That makes sense.

1370
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:20,500
As long as it's not a retain to die no thank you yes I agree that this is a good bill that needs a few corrections.

1371
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:32,000
The reason that I seconded the motion to retain is that I think with making a few corrections, this bill should be passed.

1372
01:15:32,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I think trying to combine it with 639, much as I would have liked to see 639 signed into law um it seems like there's a good chance that trying to combine 180 and 639 will end up killing both of them and that it would be better to retain 180 and make a couple of corrections um and pass it in the next session than to try and go back and combine it with 639.

1373
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That was why I seconded the motion to retain fair enough representative burrows no at my point okay representative amin so i also support retain um the bill obviously came to us with not fully baked.

1374
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,500
And we also heard this is a national issue caused by national legislation.

1375
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:46,500
And some of the examples that we heard were from other states, like I think Florida is one that I remember from the testimony.

1376
01:16:46,500 --> 01:17:09,500
So I think taking our time with this is the right approach so i support retain thank you anybody else okay seeing that uh so i make the motion to retain do i and representative gives seconds the clerk will call the roll for retaining representative.

1377
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
Yes.

1378
