and you know that yeah
 
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919 align:start position:0%
right now it's going to be late today
 
00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:15.259 align:start position:0%

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
these are hearing so we can just pump
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459 align:start position:0%
you've been there recently and I can't
 
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
remember what I was all with
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody I trust everybody
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
he's got those eyes wide open this
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
morning and either very happy over the
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
Chiefs winning are very sad that the
 
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
Eagles didn't win
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
have fun with it uh write the first we
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
have a number of hearings this morning
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
it looks like we have six hearings this
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
morning so with that I'd like to get on
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
with the first one uh that's dealing
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
with HP 204 represent Belcher is the
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill it's an act
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
relative to non-academic surveys in
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
schools and representative Belcher
 
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.570 align:start position:0%
schools and representative Belcher
welcome

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:37.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and good morning chairman Ladd
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
and honorable members of the committee
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
so this bill is
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
is quite simple but we'll get into it
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll see that it may not be that
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
simple but it is still quite simple
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
so I've only added a few words to
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to non-academic surveys
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
that are prohibited
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
I have clarified that it doesn't matter
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's physical or digital just to
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that's very clear
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
and I've added one more category which
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
is emotional responses
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
now the reason I've done that is because
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
as I was campaigning for this job
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
and speaking to a lot of constituents
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
and attending a lot of meetings I heard
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
from a lot of concerned parents that
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
they are were questions being posed to
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
them on various tests and surveys and
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
whatnot in their schools that were
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
probing into how their children felt
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
about certain things
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and they thought that was inappropriate
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
they felt that the the idea that you're
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
when you leave the three R's as we call
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
it and we start getting into feelings
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
and how children feel about things we're
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
getting away from education and we're
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
moving into the field of psychology
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
because that is where feelings and
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
emotions are properly dealt with
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
and I think we all know that that
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the teachers are not generally
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
trained psychologists and generally
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
speaking I don't think they want to be
 
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
practicing psychology on children so
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
there was a genuine concern about things
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
that were actually happening I was able
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
to see some of the questions that they
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
were referring to they brought them to
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
my attention so these are real things
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
that are occurring in New Hampshire
 
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:26.690 align:start position:0%
that are occurring in New Hampshire
schools

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.670 align:start position:0%
schools
um

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
so then there's the other track which
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
then this gets into a little bit more
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
theoretical but it's extremely important
 
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
to understand and it gets into some
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
really cutting-edge stuff
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
so as we all know technology is becoming
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
more important every day not just in our
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
lives but in schools they're using
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
technology as an adjunct to help teach
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
children constantly
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
now some of the stuff they're doing and
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff that is happening
 
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:56.420 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
relies on
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
you could call it a form of manipulation
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's actually something known
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
technically as nudge theory if you were
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
to do a simple Google search for nudge
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
Theory Academia or nudge theory in
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
education you would find a Litany of
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
Education articles and academic Journal
 
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.370 align:start position:0%
Education articles and academic Journal
papers

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
papers
 
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
advising how
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
by obtaining something of a
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
psychological profile of a student
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
through understanding their emotional
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
responses to certain things
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
they can actually plug that information
 
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
into Cutting Edge
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
algorithmically driven artificial
 
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
intelligence programs that are being
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
offered up through some of these
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
education programs
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
um some of them come in the forms of
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
digital friends that students
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
communicate with through their computers
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
or devices
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
and through nudge Theory what they're
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
actually able to do is apply a very
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
subtle behavioral modification
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
and a lot of a lot of it is designed not
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
simply to stop you know anti-social or
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
bad behaviors but to actually inculcate
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
and indoctrinate into values-based items
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
that are very controversial
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
and items for political debate and
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
discussion and not things that should
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
Simply Be
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
pushed on the students without parents
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd be happy to take
 
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative yes
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Myler thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.060 align:start position:0%
seen in this committee
 
00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:49.339 align:start position:0%
this session
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
Expressions concerned about the mental
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
health of students
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem and we'll all have
 
00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:58.700 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
with your language here of not being
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
able to check the emotional part of it
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
how do schools begin to identify the
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
of students so that the appropriate
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
Services can be provided to them to help
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
them out thank you well thank you very
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
much for the question and I think that
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
that goes to the fundamental question
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at here because I
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
would I would assert that
 
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:31.700 align:start position:0%
the educational environment of a school
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
is not the appropriate place to be
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
screening or administering Mental Health
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
on children that is not an appropriate
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
environment the teachers are not trained
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
that is the primary responsibility of
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
parents obviously when when something
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
out of the norm is detected it's
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
perfectly acceptable to communicate with
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
parents to move forward with what the
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
parents would like to direct for mental
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
health treatment but schools are not um
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
they're not facilities from they're not
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
medical facilities they're education
 
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.329 align:start position:0%
medical facilities they're education
facilities

00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.610 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
do you think that public education
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
can you expound a little bit I'm not
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
exactly sure what you mean so we know
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you know Public Schools
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
teach at C around 150 000 students in in
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a year in the year
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
and out of those hundred and fifty
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
thousand there's a significant number of
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
them who have situations
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
um where they don't have a terrific
 
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.389 align:start position:0%
um where they don't have a terrific
um

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.889 align:start position:0%
um
parents

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
or or adults to go back to to to guide
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
them to help them uh to feed them to
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
clothe them to offer safety to them
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just the opposite and the
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.370 align:start position:0%
school district
um

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
provides a safety net for that for
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
abused children for homeless children
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
for Hungry children for children that
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
are having having difficulties and
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
um it seems that to me that what you're
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
saying is we should just ignore that
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
absolutely not abusive and neglectful
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
behavior is abhorrent and absolutely I
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
believe I generally speaking almost
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
anybody is a mandated reporter in this
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
state and I think that obviously
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
um whenever necessary and appropriate
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
contact to medical professionals and
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and law enforcement is totally
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
necessary and that's something I had to
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
do often as a paramedic when I was
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
working unfortunately I found some very
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
difficult situations
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
so how do you know
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
I mean in in a lot of instances kids are
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
really good at hiding issues like that
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
and they they're very afraid and if they
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
don't talk to you and they don't there
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
isn't an emotional interchange where
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
they're you're talking about that how do
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
you expect that that schools can can be
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
that kind of safety net for students
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I that's what I mean sure
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I would go in two
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
different directions with that first of
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
all I would say the bill itself
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
um if it clarifies this that it's
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
talking about surveys physical or
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
digital so we're not talking about you
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
know having one-on-one conversations or
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
a teacher getting to know their student
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
and having a relationship there
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
um the other direction I would go to
 
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:42.620 align:start position:0%
answer that question is that
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative dry
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um so

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
tell me how
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh privacy goes on these surveys I mean
 
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.130 align:start position:0%
uh privacy goes on these surveys I mean
either

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
there's no way to determine what
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
particular child has a particular
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
problem or there is a violation of
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
privacy how do you draw that what that
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
final question that's a very good point
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
if if you're if you're going to be
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
removing identifying information
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
obviously from surveys such as I believe
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
the CDC survey that I forget what it's
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
called it's on here I believe that does
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
that so that doesn't offer the
 
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to individually Target
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
students for any kind of intervention
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
the best you could probably do is uh is
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
community or some other Collective based
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
Intervention which is not particularly
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
useful like it doesn't seem
 
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.890 align:start position:0%
useful like it doesn't seem
um

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a very good question
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
um there would be no way to remove the
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
individual identifying information from
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
a survey
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
um in order to protect Privacy
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
Information and still be able to Target
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
a student
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
who was demonstrating any sort of
 
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299 align:start position:0%
um mental health issues and so it would
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
have to be a non-private situation
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and that and whether that information
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
is stored in a local manner or a far
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
away server that could also be a
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
considerable concern we know that a lot
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
of the the companies that
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
um that are applying this kind of
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
Technology especially with the digital
 
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.230 align:start position:0%
Technology especially with the digital
surveys

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
they do have off-site servers they may
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
not even be located in this country
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Damon
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then representative woodcock
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
following up on your answer to
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me that you're
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
acknowledging and correct me if I'm not
 
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:55.820 align:start position:0%
hearing this accurately
 
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
hearing this accurately
that

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
surveys gather aggregate data
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
so therefore if that's true
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
surveying a population of students in
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:11.780 align:start position:0%
their report
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
of their well-being including emotional
 
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.909 align:start position:0%
of their well-being including emotional
well-being

00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
would not violate anyone's privacy or
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
safety it would simply be a better
 
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.010 align:start position:0%
safety it would simply be a better
understanding

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
of the status of the say 10 year old
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
population or whatever group is being
 
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.610 align:start position:0%
population or whatever group is being
surveyed

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
surveyed
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'd be happy to clarify so
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
I believe surveys can obviously be
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
engineered in multiple ways you can have
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
surveys that do remove identifying
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
information such as I believe the CDC
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
survey that can therefore then be used
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
for other kinds of like I say
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
collective-based intervention
 
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.549 align:start position:0%
collective-based intervention
um

00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
but there are also surveys that are
 
00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:57.419 align:start position:0%
individual that are given in class every
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
day that may even be attached to
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
academic instruction
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
and such as tests that begin to probe
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
into information that is
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
feelings based or is based on things in
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
your household that could have
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
attached to it and further when you
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
begin to attach the digital component of
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
it that again this is Cutting Edge stuff
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
that stuff is designed to be
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
individualistic that stuff is designed
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
to feed into an artificial intelligence
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
model that is going to approach an
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
individual child in an individualized
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
way in order to apply these algorithms
 
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.730 align:start position:0%
way in order to apply these algorithms
um

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
so that's obviously not at all private
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
could you cite some resources for
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
what you just said because honestly I'm
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
not on the same page and I'd like to
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
understand where
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
where's the data that this is happening
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
where is it published sure
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
um well if you were to Google
 
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
um I believe the phrase is nudge Theory
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
education I believe one of the first two
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
or three links that's going to come up
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
is an article from the journal Ed week
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
which is a major education Journal
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
publication that talks about how they're
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
incorporating these um these
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
Technologies into the classroom there's
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
also as I said a whole Litany of
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
academic literature there's other major
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
education journals major Publications
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
articles to this effect that will get
 
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
into the details of nudge Theory and
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
algorithmically driven artificial
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
intelligence and artificial friends that
 
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
children can interact with in some of
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
these programs that
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
and how it's designed to again affect
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.210 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:58.580 align:start position:0%
and do those resources you just cited
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
document this is happening to our New
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students I'm highly skeptical
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question I don't have
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
a survey of everything that's going on
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I do know that some of
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
the larger companies such as amplify do
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
have their their toes in the water I
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
could say on this sort of thing I don't
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
know exactly what's been deployed across
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock did you have
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
I did a few minutes ago thank you
 
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.409 align:start position:0%
I did a few minutes ago thank you
um

00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
president I'm following up on I wasn't
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
following up on but I am now on on the
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
question I just asked you up
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
you made a statements that sure is given
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think it said in classroom survey to
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
give it to classrooms every day
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh and sometimes including for academic
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
destruction that's what you say if
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
they're wrote it down
 
00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.690 align:start position:0%
they're wrote it down
um

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
this is a school district policy
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
teachers typically don't start creating
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
individual surveys and individual things
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
for students so I I don't understand
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
that that connection of in the classroom
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
every single day for instruction
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
that that being said the you can clarify
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
that for me the second part is the
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I understand the analytics of the
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
future world uh but these surveys uh
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
typically the ones I've been involved
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
with over the years uh disaggregate the
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
data of a group so you can find out and
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
Target certain areas of say instruction
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
or say education or say uh this this
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
part of the region has difficult issues
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're gonna say the bomb down there or
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
an explosion say the school like a
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
school had had an issue okay where they
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
made it in a bomb or a killing or
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
something so that they tied to the whole
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
state they see that wow we need to bring
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
in some intervention because we find all
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
the kids are actually aren't responding
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
as well as their thoughts for those
 
00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.149 align:start position:0%
as well as their thoughts for those
things

00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
um but there's a lot of people but uh
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
where have you have you seen the survey
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
the teachers just give out every day
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
like this I mean this does it seems like
 
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.029 align:start position:0%
like this I mean this does it seems like
that's

00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
but you think these come out willy-nilly
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
I mean they have to be all the preceding
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
pieces to this legislation they're in
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
they're in law right now deal with the
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
structures you're aware of parents are
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
on the website
 
00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:23.299 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know where you're sure
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
you're coming from with this okay I'm
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
gonna try to pull all the pieces out of
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
that so I can try to build a picture
 
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.769 align:start position:0%
that so I can try to build a picture
um

00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
so as far as my statement that this is
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
happening in an everyday context it's
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's due to some of the stuff that I was
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
brought by some of my constituents and
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
as I was speaking with them that some
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
some such things that are probing into
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
emotional responses such as how students
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
feel about certain things they're part
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
of everyday
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
um quizzing and testing that is
 
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
um quizzing and testing that is
occurring

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
um per these constituents and they
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
showed me some of the documentation of
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
this so that is what I meant when it
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
came to that
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
um as far as the disaggregated data and
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
targeting I believe that's the reason
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
that we left the CDC one alone but I
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
would however go back to the the sort of
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
foundational principle here which is
 
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.130 align:start position:0%
foundational principle here which is
that

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
fundamentally schools are not places of
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment they are places
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and because they're not equipped
 
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:27.620 align:start position:0%
like a mental health treatment center
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
when you administer some of these things
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
to students when you start playing with
 
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.330 align:start position:0%
to students when you start playing with
psychological

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.340 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
algorithms or whether it's probing
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions you can cause
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
um certain harms mentally and schools
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily prepared to deal
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
with that teachers are not necessarily
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
prepared to deal with that that is
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
better left to a a proper professional
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative for did you have your
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
hand up yes I did
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
with apologies for my English prop
 
00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:03.529 align:start position:0%
with apologies for my English prop
background

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:27:05.169 --> 00:27:05.179 align:start position:0%
I would
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
I would like to pose the question
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
is there something inherent in
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
asking you know how you feel about
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
something rather than what do you think
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's an interesting
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
question so to clarify first ask nothing
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
in the bill would prohibit a teacher
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
asking this is referring to
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
physical and digital surveys and
 
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
questionnaires and stuff like that
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so if you're next to your actual
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
question whether there's a difference
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
between feel
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
and um believe was or thing and think
 
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
and um believe was or thing and think
um

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
that is a much more complicated question
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
we can get into the sort of
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
um epistemological question of whether
 
00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:58.340 align:start position:0%
a feelings based
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
subjective view of the world versus an
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
objective view of the world where you're
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
using rationality versus it goes back to
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
Russo's Romanticism versus locks
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
important rationality often have factual
 
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.390 align:start position:0%
important rationality often have factual
reasons

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
for one and you have emotional reasons
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
for the other I believe that's correct
 
00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:23.810 align:start position:0%
for the other I believe that's correct
yes

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Allison well thank
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
question uh could you share with us what
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
are some of the specific questions that
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
were on the surveys that your
 
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
constituents objected to I mean I'm
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
trying to try to tie this down a little
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
bit sure thank you and I I can give you
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
sort of my best remembrance I don't
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
quote me on the exact thing but they
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
were there were items such as
 
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.870 align:start position:0%
were there were items such as
um

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
they were sometimes they would begin
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
with a question about uh this family can
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
afford to do this thing but this family
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
can't afford to do this thing and it
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
could be a math sort of thing but then
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
it kind of trails off from the math part
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
into well how do we feel about this
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
family that couldn't afford to do this
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
thing and what do we think maybe ought
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be done about that and what are your
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
feelings on it and and we're we're going
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
down in this context we were taking a
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
math problem from a math class and kind
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
of going in a in strange
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh social Direction in a strange
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
Direction probing into feelings and
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
emotions uh that the that in that case
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
my constituent felt was inappropriate
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes sir uh in so the first
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
part of your response in terms of the
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
the example of two families with
 
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.210 align:start position:0%
the example of two families with
whatever

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.889 align:start position:0%
whatever
um

00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:41.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
and and that's a math problem then
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
specifically on this survey it then said
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about this situation I
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
mean is that what you're you're saying
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
to us yes it was something don't quote
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
me on the exact language but it was to
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
that effect the context is correct
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a question I haven't
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
asked one yet
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the U.S risk behavior
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
survey and it's designed to elicit
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
information from students yes and
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's a question right here I'd like
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
you to respond to
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
that in the youth risk behavior survey
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh 23 New Hampshire
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
during the past 12 months how many times
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
did someone you were dating or going out
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
with purposely tried to control you or
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
emotionally hurt you
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
my question is are we getting Beyond
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
asking part here and getting into the
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
thinking or what you know about this
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
emotionally hurting a person is that a
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
question that might be reconsidered how
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
this is asked in the survey
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
um just as regards to that CDC survey
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not a personally a big fan of it
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
being administered without strict
 
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.010 align:start position:0%
being administered without strict
permission

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
um if I thought I could do that with
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
this and have a chance of it getting
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
past I probably would have crafted the
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill that way as far as that specific
 
00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.389 align:start position:0%
bill that way as far as that specific
question

00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
um how do they feel about that
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
when you get into the psychological
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
context when you're actually trying to
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
elicit psychological information that's
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
in a perfectly appropriate question and
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
it is I think perhaps going to lead you
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
down a path that a psychologist a
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
trained professional would go down in
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
order to begin affecting a course of
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
treatment and Care toward helping
 
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.409 align:start position:0%
treatment and Care toward helping
somebody

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
um but that's not what's happening in a
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
school environment when those questions
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
asked if you disaggregate the
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
information you have no access to the
 
00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
information you have no access to the
person

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
all you're getting is data which may or
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
may not be correct we've heard that it
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
probably is but it doesn't actually do
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
much to help that person and that
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
environment I don't think is appropriate
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Damon
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it is important for
 
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.789 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it is important for
students

00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
people in general
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to identify and label their
 
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:10.730 align:start position:0%
to be able to identify and label their
emotions

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a difficult
 
00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299 align:start position:0%
question identify can you can you be a
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
little more specific when you need to
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
identify and label as in what what in
 
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.730 align:start position:0%
identify and label as in what what in
particular

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
a student might be physically acting out
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
say stopping their feet or you know some
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
physical manifestation of something
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
and a teacher might say
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that student would say I'm
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
very angry or I'm very frustrated or
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that student
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
are they able to identify and label the
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
emotion that is driving their behavior
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I appreciate the
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
clarification I think
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
I think I would have to answer whether
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
or not they can understand the
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of the emotion and
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
regulate it internally is going to be
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
far more important than whether they can
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
put a label to it but I could I suppose
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
there would be certain utility in being
 
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
able to put a label to it
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
perhaps if I could ask you to focus more
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
on the capacity of the student to
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
identify their emotion
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
not worry about the terminology but that
 
00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
not worry about the terminology but that
they

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
it sounds more like the kind of thing
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
you might do sitting on a couch than a
 
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.810 align:start position:0%
you might do sitting on a couch than a
classroom

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
um do we have any other pink cards or
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get a handle on that
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:13.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
representative

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.589 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
I'd like to bring to the table reality
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
in a public school setting because of my
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
experiences uh for so long and I really
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
am just trying to share information for
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
people who aren't aware of what really
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
um situation I just like to get a feel
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
for it by the way I think we have a
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
minimum standard or a law that requires
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
us to do social emotional learning
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
within our schools
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if you're aware of
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
that there are screenings that that are
 
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
used for that
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
but an example
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
so I was a principal of three schools K
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
to four
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
and every morning I was greeted by a
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
student who was as tall as I was who
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
called me an F MF or every morning
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
now the school counselor was in Bartlett
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
School and the school nurse was immersed
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
in school
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances would a nudge
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
for being called a name
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
every day every day upon entry
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that would
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
qualify necessarily as a actionable
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
criminal offense that seems like
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
more of a school discipline action I
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
mean when I was in school if you did
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
that you would you would be suspended
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
and that seemed to work out pretty well
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part well it turned out to
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
be a student that was special needs and
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
behaviors learned
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
it they don't come to school they don't
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
learn it at school it's learned at home
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
and so it took over a month to change
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
the effect of that student
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
to understand that whatever he was
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
bringing to school from home needed to
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
change his affect and so if we weren't
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
able to process or if I wasn't able to
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
work with that student every single day
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
to process
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
that even if you're his mother you know
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
whatever happened when he got dropped
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
off it wasn't okay for him to express
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
his anger coming through the door so it
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
really wasn't a discipline issue for
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
school it was a matter of unchanging
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
behavior my question yes he answered
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
well yes I asked him if he would call
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
the police about that because he
 
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned that okay she would call the
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
police so that's it so he responded Yes
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
yep that's it thanks for their questions
 
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
may I just responded that real quick
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
since I think there was a little bit of
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
a question there
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
I would just say that
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that the situation worked out
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
as such but I don't think you can draw a
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
conclusion that because one methodology
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
was successful another methodology would
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
not have been successful that would be a
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
logical fallacy so it very well I'm not
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
saying it would have but it may have
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent Balboni
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question thank you Mr
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.190 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I just have are you making any
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
distinct it seems like you're
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
distinguishing between oral versus
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
written or digital so say if I was a
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
teacher in uh second grade and I had a
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
circle and I was curious about the mood
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
of my students that day and I had them
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
just take out a pen and pencil and write
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
down how are you feeling today would you
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
consider that a survey
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
no I think it's very clear that physical
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
or digital would not consider that I
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
think that was done on purpose because
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
we understand that humans have human
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
relationships and that includes teachers
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
and students and I don't think that's
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
something that we would seek to to
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
prohibit or alter or do anything to we
 
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
the idea is to prohibit intrusive
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
written and digital surveys that would
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
be inappropriate I believe in the school
 
00:38:11.339 --> 00:38:12.410 align:start position:0%
be inappropriate I believe in the school
setting

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and Lead toward
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
items that are not also not appropriate
 
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
such as the application of nudge Theory
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
or other psychological psychologizing in
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
yes follow up um would that also apply
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
to like self-service say if you were in
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
a class and you were taking us given a
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
set of questions that you answered that
 
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
were only for your own use they were put
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
out there as part of an assignment and
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
That You Did in the class but we're not
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily shared they were part of a
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
self-identification process
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
yes there would be no exception for for
 
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
yes there would be no exception for for
that

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
we need to turn off the red
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
we have a few moment is there anybody
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
here from Health and Human Services that
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
could answer something regarding youth
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey as a technical
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
question which I do have one
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
welcome you've been here many times
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
um it is a card filled so why don't you
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
just pass it around so that we can have
 
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.390 align:start position:0%
just pass it around so that we can have
that

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:36.829 align:start position:0%
that
foreign

00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
my question for you is that the the
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
question I read here is where I'd like
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
to start is during the past 12 months
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
how many times did someone you were
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
dating or going out with purposely try
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
to control you or emotionally hurt you
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
my question is I know this information's
 
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.410 align:start position:0%
my question is I know this information's
disaggregated

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
disaggregated
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
any availability of information where a
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
particular region or a school has a
 
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.349 align:start position:0%
particular region or a school has a
whole

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
that has a lot more than just 10 kids
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
kids in it is informed that you have a
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
very high incidence of something such as
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
this occurring so that the school can
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
turn around and use it in supporting and
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
assisting or helping
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
um in this regard
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad again for the
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Abby Rogers
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division of
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
public health statistic emblematic in
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
so to answer the question I think they
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
focus on how School uses data more
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
specifically on this type of question
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
um did I get that right well if a
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
question comes back is there any way of
 
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
determining that
 
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.050 align:start position:0%
determining that
um

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
School District X has a high response in
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
regard to this particular question where
 
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.020 align:start position:0%
it happened five or six times at least
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
and where they've had this emotional
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
um issue that they're dealing with uh
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
how how does that data help
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
the district that's you know part of
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
this survey when it's all disaggregated
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
and may come back in the form for the
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
state as a whole
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's just like we're doing mathematics
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find out where we're
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
hurting in math and we're trying to
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
disaggregate that information down so we
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
find out there's the issue right there
 
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
how do you do that with this survey so
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
for the so many data that we do today
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
are aggregated uh depends on the regions
 
00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
and we have the state level data we have
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
the Public Health Region data we also
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
have school district data so for the
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
Public Health Region as well as state
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
level data those are publicly available
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
and we look into by demographic area uh
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
like a gender
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
um grades not agebook grades and
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes if a data supports or data
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
balance is enough we will also look into
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
raising ethnicity but that's very
 
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.530 align:start position:0%
raising ethnicity but that's very
um

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
um the major race in New Hampshire it is
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
white so so for the other races we
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
probably don't do not have that type of
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
data to support that depends on the
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
response rate for the specific question
 
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
or for the specific Topic in terms of
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
how School utilize the data or the
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh intendants they get
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
their own school district report in this
 
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
in the school district report that they
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
can look into the time trend on the same
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
questions asking
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
year by year by year and then for that
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
way they will be able to see how the
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
trends all the response for this
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
specific questions how students um
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
reported themselves whether they got
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
hurt or based on the question that you
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned whether the trends
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
goes up for the specific schools or
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether the train goes down or where the
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
train keeps the same in that way I
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
believe the school can utilize their own
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
resource to go to the focus area that
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
they would like to help with the
 
00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:13.430 align:start position:0%
they would like to help with the
students

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you that that that's good to hear
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
that but the next question I would have
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
is this information you provide to the
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
local school or School District
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
no excuse me no photo School
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
specifically report they are not
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
available to the public for several
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
reasons the first reason is that the
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
school report are not weighted so we are
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
not able to provide the information on
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
the statistical meaning to identify this
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
school is doing better or worse
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
comparing to the Public Health Region or
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state level what do we encourage in
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
the school to look into the report is to
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
look into their own school
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
performance compared to the time Trend
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
compared to the specific Geographic
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
excuse me demographic group like male
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
female over by grades to see if there's
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of outstanding for example
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
this type of question may impact a
 
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
certain group of students in their
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
schools that's what we encourage the
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
school to utilize the report and focus
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
on the particular group in order to put
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
some resource into that group so in in
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
just my last follow-up on that so the
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
school district is aware
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
but in order to try and we we know that
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
education is a partnership between the
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
the home life the parent the schools
 
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
the home life the parent the schools
Etc

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
how are we going to ever correct
 
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:45.020 align:start position:0%
something if the school district doesn't
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
communicate these results to the parent
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
or the community
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm in a good position to
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
answer that because that would be a part
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
um prevention uh whether it's in the
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
school level District level or in the
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
state level my position can provide the
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
um you know getting information how
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
school will utilize the data but how
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
schools actually utilize the data that's
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
the part of information I do not have
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
but we are happy to get other folks from
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
Bureau of drug and alcohol services or
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
other like in injury prevention programs
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
um crisis center Etc to provide more
 
00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
information how school work with them to
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
utilize the data on their specific
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
School District thank you very much for
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
answering those questions through Santa
 
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
answering those questions through Santa
Luna

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
Luna
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and uh and
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
a follow-up actually to um to your your
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
questions here oftentimes when when this
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee has heard uh a bill relative
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
to um to a non-academic survey or maybe
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
even more specifically the um the youth
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
risk behavior survey
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
people from other organizations such as
 
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:02.060 align:start position:0%
um Chief David Goldstein from Franklin
 
00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:05.099 align:start position:0%
would uh would be in attendance to
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
testify as to the importance of of that
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
Anonymous data that applies directly to
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
the community that his Department serves
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I do know from my time of school
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
board that school boards do receive
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
maybe not as detailed a report as the
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
one you're talking about but I think
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
there is the trend data as you've
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
suggested I was wondering if you could
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
um talk a little bit too and I think
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
this goes to um to represent vlad's
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
question how other community service
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
organizations might be able to use some
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
of this data and why it's so important
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and since we have the state
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
level and also Public Health Region so
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
for the Public Health Region we identify
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
13 Public Health Reaching Across the
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
states is finer than the county level so
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
for political Health Region data is
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
available some communities they utilize
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
Public Health Region data for example
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
like a greater National or greater
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester to identify you know the
 
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
trend and also the particular
 
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
demographic groups in in their region or
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
in their Network in terms of the schools
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
it will up to the school board or the
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
superintendent particularly how the
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
schools would like to distribute the
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
report to Their audience so some schools
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
are very open what I observed to share
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
the school level data over District
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
level data with the school board or even
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
post down their own website some schools
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
um on the other way they you know they
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
they perform the elements to the schools
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
but uh they may just keep it in in their
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
own like a school counselors for them to
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
be able to utilize the data so I cannot
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
speak for how schools uh they use the
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
data currently but we do encourage the
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
schools to look into the data uh look at
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
the trends for each um questions if it's
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
comparable Time After Time and also
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
focus on uh some Trends if there is some
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
kind of like a data point that goes up
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
particularly in 2021 which we have seen
 
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
in the preliminary data that mental
 
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
health is a concern for 2021 data
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
compared to other years those are the
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
areas that the schools will do encourage
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
schools to look into the data and then
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
work with the local communities or even
 
00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
the state program areas to uh allocate
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
the resources order to provide some
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that open up another question for me
 
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
and then represent so you see some
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
schools share the data
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
some schools choose not to maybe share
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
it with the counselors
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
I guess from what I'm hearing you there
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
isn't I guess any kind of statutory
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
language or federal language that says
 
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
why are some schools sharing this and
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
communicating the disaggregated
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
information to the public and others not
 
00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
information to the public and others not
I

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.030 align:start position:0%
I
yeah

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I think I could I can try
 
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
to answer that I think uh my
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is some schools do share
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
it you know publicly on their website to
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
inform Community Partners of the health
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
of their schools others may may make
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
that decision internally to share it
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
just internally I think it depends on
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
the school district and I certainly
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
we're not kind of well advanced in the
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
knowledge of who shares what but
 
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:02.060 align:start position:0%
certainly the yrbs data is used
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
widespread in New Hampshire through
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
Community organizations to inform all
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of measures for tobacco use
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention domestic violence
 
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.130 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention domestic violence
prevention

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
um uh chronic disease prevention for HIV
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
obesity substance abuse I mean it's it's
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
really the biggest measure to the health
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
of the school population I'm not
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
questioning those categories I'm I'm
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
looking at how this information is used
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
the community and dealing with some of
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
these concerns right sure so the way why
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
RBS data is is used to inform program
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
planning in the community certainly at
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and you know identify indicators
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
where a certain Community needs to be
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
able to go to provide some prevention
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
for those issues represent Woodcock did
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
you have a question a very quick one
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you and as a follow-up to
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative lad it's thinking
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually someone was thinking when
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about trending and
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
surveys and data points uh you mentioned
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
recently just about the mental health
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
issues obviously came post uh the
 
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:06.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh does DHS
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS or uh in conjunction with doe do
 
00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:13.700 align:start position:0%
either of you provide to school
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
communities potential programs or
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
options how to help when you see
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
trending data going in negative uh trend
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so we do have
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
a like what Abby address we do have
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
enjoyed prevention programs and also
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
crisis centers that works with the um
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
the schools and as well as the public
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
health regions
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
um they work with the schools very
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
closely to look into the data on their
 
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:48.500 align:start position:0%
original data and if the superintendents
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
also provide the data to the network
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
they also look into the data together as
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
well in terms of some services that we
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
provide in the school reported that we
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh relates to the superintendent we do
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
put some program information like a
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
crisis center or the Public Health
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
Region who they can contact you if they
 
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:12.740 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the particular question not
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
the data question but particular you
 
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
know how they queue response to this
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
kind of Trend in their schools we do
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
provide that type of contact information
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
in the report the radius to the
 
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
superintendents as well thank you
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much are the
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
further quite representative Miler thank
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr church just to clarification what
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
you're saying
um

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that was pointed out
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
in the testimony was a concern that
 
00:52:44.049 --> 00:52:44.059 align:start position:0%
schools are not really there to provide
 
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
emotional issues that they're there to
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
just teach the three r's my presumption
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
isn't to clarify this for me if there is
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an emotional issue
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's identified in the survey
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
that school then would then refer that
 
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
that school then would then refer that
issue

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
to a professional be it a school
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
counselor social worker somebody from
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
your office perhaps but it would not
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a teacher but it'd be
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who would be trained in dealing
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
with that particular issue that was
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
identified in the response of the survey
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
I do not have uh and so for that
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
question because that will fall under
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
how School operate over a Provider
 
00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:28.549 align:start position:0%
how School operate over a Provider
Services

00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
um you know for us we provided the data
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
that after the survey and then also
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of support how to read
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
the data for example and if there's a
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
need we also connect the schools with
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
other resources from the state agencies
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
if they would like to look for more
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
information but whether uh it would be a
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
particular teacher or a trend a social
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
worker Consular for example to help the
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
student that will fall under the school
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
operation thank you very much
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to make make sure because it
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
with the questioning it sounds almost
 
00:54:07.319 --> 00:54:08.750 align:start position:0%
with the questioning it sounds almost
like

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
some people think that the school gets
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
individual results these are still
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
aggregate results that the School
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
receives not individual in other words
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
they would not know that
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
Sally Jones got hurt in a
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
relationship emotionally hurt in a
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
relationship they the trend and the
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
trend and the aggregate data is all
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
treated as statistics not as individuals
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
is that am I right on that that is car
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
access Court does not receive the raw
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
data they receive the aggregate report
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
that has owed the 9th to 12th graders
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
who responded to the questions or
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
participated in the surveys that report
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
is all aggregate data and there is no
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
identified to see which class this
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
record is from over
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
um you know we which
 
00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:03.770 align:start position:0%
um you know we which
um

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
classroom old classical teacher's name
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
is not available on the data or the
 
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
report that superintendents receive
 
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
report that superintendents receive
yes

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
so when you receive if aggregate data
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
whether you're a Mental Health
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
institution or a school
 
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.829 align:start position:0%
institution or a school
area

00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
would that would it logically seem as
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
though the the re the
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
or The Logical result of that is that
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
they would Institute programs that would
 
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
be in general for the population that
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with that might have it
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
an exceptionally High abuse or emotional
 
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
abuse station rather than
 
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.410 align:start position:0%
abuse station rather than
um

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
again individual training uh you know
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
targeted to a very small group
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes indeed
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
like it would be generally uh the data
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
would inform the school Community uh
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
like Trends in the school Community
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
which then also could be
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
representational of perhaps a broader
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
Community concern uh so that that is
 
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.190 align:start position:0%
Community concern uh so that that is
correct

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
are those are the further questions
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh yes I just want
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
to provide more information related to
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
the school report the county that we
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
provide in the school is not the actual
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
number of students who answer the
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
question with the implemented uh the
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
couch uh that the respondent count to
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
the actual enrollment number so it's
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
kind of like a projection so it's not
 
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
actually you know five students answer
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
this question that means only five
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
students who took the survey on that day
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
answer the question that is also
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
increment um and Modified by the um
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
enrollment number to be able to provide
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
a more General and more aggregate level
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the data thank you
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
I did receive one of the card
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
which does not take any position as
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
offering any kind of technical support
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
we may want on this it's Becky Wilson
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
from the school boards Association does
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions for the school
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
Becky

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning for the record
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
Becky Wilson from the New Hampshire
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
school boards Association I heard a
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
number of questions I think most of them
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
have been answered but I'm happy to
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions about how
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
these results are shared was through
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
school boards Etc in the public thank
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Tanner thank you
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned with
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
what we keep hearing that the teachers
 
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
are not psychologists that um you know
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
were that even counselors aren't
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
training trained in mental health and I
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
wonder if
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
school boards have kind of a policy
 
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.390 align:start position:0%
school boards have kind of a policy
where

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:17.180 align:start position:0%
there's a delineation
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
certainly for teachers of signs and
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
symptoms that then get sent to a higher
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
level of of
 
00:58:26.339 --> 00:58:27.710 align:start position:0%
level of of
um

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
a profession that's within the school
 
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.790 align:start position:0%
a profession that's within the school
and

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the school psychologists the school
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
social worker maybe the special
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
education teacher
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I will do
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
my best I think to address your concerns
 
00:58:44.099 --> 00:58:45.109 align:start position:0%
my best I think to address your concerns
so

00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that part of the
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and part of the
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
Staffing that is required as a result of
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards requires schools
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
to have certain people with certain
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
licenses and certain certifications
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
those people are teachers school
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
counselors School psychologists School
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
social workers Etc not all of those
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
positions are mandated necessarily but
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
each of them carry with them a certain
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
criteria that you need to meet in order
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
to become licensed to do that job those
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
are not the kinds of jobs where people
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
are on alternative plans necessarily or
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
are doing them with you know other kinds
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
of oversight those are very specific
 
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.849 align:start position:0%
of oversight those are very specific
positions

00:59:24.849 --> 00:59:24.859 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
schools have processes for determining
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
individual student need and who is
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
referred to what person or what
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
department based on those needs and I
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
would a share that I believe for the
 
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
most part most schools have a threshold
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term of what is a
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
school-related education related mental
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
health need and what goes beyond that
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
and schools have very specific processes
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
about when they refer out so to speak
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
with parents uh to get more services for
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
students who may need more services
 
01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:03.260 align:start position:0%
there are not necessarily
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
psychologist services that you're
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
receiving at the school level is not
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same psychologist
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
Services you are going to receive in a
 
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
mental health center in your community
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
that a parent is taking a child to to
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
address concerns School psychologists
 
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
for the most part in public schools are
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
providing education evaluations as part
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
of a special ed process for example or
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
something to that effect so certainly
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
not every school has access to all of
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
those positions either either due to
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
funding or due to Geographics that
 
01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
there's just not those kinds of people
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
in all of those schools so there are
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
many schools that contract out with
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
local providers for certain services but
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
again they're educationally based Mental
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
Health Services and just to clarify and
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
I think reiterate what was already said
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
School level data from the yrbs comes
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
back to the school for a very particular
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
purpose and that is to make sure that
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
your high schools are understanding
 
01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:02.059 align:start position:0%
their kind of current
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
group of students that are in their
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
schools and what their needs may be as a
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
whole and that information at least from
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
my own experience is shared at a school
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
board meeting with the school board in
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a scrubbed manner for lack
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
of a better term because depending on
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
the size of your school how many high
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
schools you have if it's just one and
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's small you want to make sure again
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
that even though you're not getting
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
individual student data that you're
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
presenting that in a public forum where
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
everybody has that information but it's
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
protecting students and families
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
personal privacy if there are not a lot
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
of students in your school
 
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.789 align:start position:0%
of students in your school
um

01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cascadden thank
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you Becky I was just curious if
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
you are aware whether School staffs are
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
still undergoing the youth Mental Health
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
First Aid course thank you for the
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
question yes a Justice Broderick has
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
been presenting at multiple high schools
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for many many years
 
01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
he continues to provide mental health
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
youth first aid survey first aid
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
training and as part of Dartmouth
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock's initiative schools ask them
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
to come and do those trainings for
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
students and that is to help other
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
students help each other it is about
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
making sure that kids understand what
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
other kids needs may be and to try to
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
support each other that is not
 
01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:25.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily simply about staff
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
identifying those things it's really
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
about creating peer relationships that
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
are supportive in that way thank you
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
not see any other questions thank you
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome
 
01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:40.099 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close this hearing
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
and March on to HB 550 this is relative
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
to Charter Public School disillusion
 
01:02:48.540 --> 01:03:06.170 align:start position:0%
to Charter Public School disillusion
550.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
welcome representative fellows
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
morning good morning
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony for this bill
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
but I didn't have an opportunity to make
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
25 copies yet so I will bring them uh
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
down right after we finish during this
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
spill so every charter school has a
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
dissolution provision that spells out
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
what will happen when any assets
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
remaining after they resolve all
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
financial obligations
 
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:54.059 align:start position:0%
and there have been at least start six
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
charter schools that have closed and had
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
to go through this process so this is
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
not you know just an academic
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
um exercise here yeah uh I wondered what
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
happened to those assets of the six
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools that closed and and
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's no information about that on the
 
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:16.220 align:start position:0%
web but there is information on the web
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
about the current Charter Schools you
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
can access all of their Charters and you
 
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
can read this particular provision so I
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
didn't look at them all but I looked at
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
10 of them
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
and all seem to give the charter school
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
board the sole Authority about making
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
decisions of
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
um what happens to remaining assets when
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
they close
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
several charter schools and these this
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
is what I found so several Charter
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
Schools provided two options to the
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
board either give assets and money to
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
another Charter School
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
or to a non-profit that supports charter
 
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
schools and in this in all cases it was
 
01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:01.819 align:start position:0%
never specified
 
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
which particular charter school or which
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
particular non-profit agency
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
one one that I looked at said all
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
remaining assets could go to any
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
501c3 which is any non-profit
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
organization one said
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
remaining assets could go to any 501 3C
 
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.069 align:start position:0%
remaining assets could go to any 501 3C
or

01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:30.980 align:start position:0%
to the federal state or local government
 
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
for educational purposes
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
one said that donated property and or
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
the proceeds from the sale of those
 
01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
donated items would be returned to the
 
01:05:43.619 --> 01:05:44.690 align:start position:0%
donated items would be returned to the
donor

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
donor
 
01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.210 align:start position:0%
donor
and

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:46.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
proceeds from the sale of items
 
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
purchased with Federal
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
or state grants would be returned to the
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
states so one thing you can see here is
 
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's many different options going on
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I think some of those options are
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
problematic when you make a donation to
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
a 501 3C I don't think that you can get
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
the money back again I think if you
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
particularly if you used it for uh don't
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
you know a deduction on your income
 
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.289 align:start position:0%
you know a deduction on your income
filing

01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
um another concern I had is that it's
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
it's fairly easy to set up a 501 3C
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned that
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
um someone related to the school in some
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
way could set up a 501 3C and then the
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
school could give the assets or the
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
proceeds to that particular
 
01:06:48.359 --> 01:06:49.630 align:start position:0%
proceeds to that particular
um

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
5013c and you know that just doesn't
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
sound that's not a
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
um doesn't sound like a good process to
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
go through
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
I also this is my opinion but I think
 
01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:03.650 align:start position:0%
I also this is my opinion but I think
that

01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
um we should consider requiring
 
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.990 align:start position:0%
um we should consider requiring
um

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
any remaining assets
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
that didn't have a particular provision
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
the donation of that item that those
 
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
the donation of that item that those
General

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
General
 
01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:22.789 align:start position:0%
General
um

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
remaining assets should go back to the
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
state because the state has paid for the
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the operating costs of
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
that school so that would be an
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to treat them but that's
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
just my opinion
 
01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:38.809 align:start position:0%
just my opinion
um

01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
so these these concerns led me to file
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
an an LSR and if you look at the bill
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
the first section of the LSR is was my
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to write a standardized
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh revision to the dissolution provision
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
that has to be in their Charter
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
but after that happened I had a meeting
 
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.010 align:start position:0%
but after that happened I had a meeting
with

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.210 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
some people from Department of Education
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
and administrative Services who had
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
how this would work and in the um in
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
that meeting other issues were also
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
identified the biggest one being that
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice has a division
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
for charitable organizations that they
 
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.150 align:start position:0%
for charitable organizations that they
oversee

01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
and charter schools because they are all
 
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.829 align:start position:0%
and charter schools because they are all
501c3

01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
um have provisions
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
that govern them for being a non-profit
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
but we also have state laws that govern
 
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
what happens to them because they are
 
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
also a public school
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that we've got some
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
conflicts going on between those two and
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
it would be useful to call together all
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
the people that are involved with that
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
could they could be involved with this
 
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.610 align:start position:0%
could they could be involved with this
and

01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
um a process that would work for
 
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.470 align:start position:0%
um a process that would work for
everyone

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I asked for the LSR to be redrafted
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
and it was late in the game because this
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
LSR actually got lost in the system and
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
so what you have here is
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
the section one is what I first proposed
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
in section two is what I asked for a
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
redraft so I would hope that you would
 
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.229 align:start position:0%
redraft so I would hope that you would
um

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
not I hope that you would pass this bill
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
just as section two
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
so there's eliminate one and just
 
01:09:54.299 --> 01:09:54.890 align:start position:0%
so there's eliminate one and just
um

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
and I think I I also
 
01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:08.300 align:start position:0%
um when I met with with the
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
depart somebody from
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
um Department of administration of
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
services and people from doe they also
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
identified that there are some issues
 
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
that are really not Financial that they
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
would like to work on and
 
01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.010 align:start position:0%
would like to work on and
um

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
one of those was mentioned was Student
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
Records what happens to the Student
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
Records when a charter school closed I
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
statute that covers that and an ongoing
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem which I can tell you from
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
even back when when I was at the
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which was more
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
than five years ago now that it has
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
always been a concern about the ability
 
01:10:53.169 --> 01:10:53.179 align:start position:0%
of some of the charter schools to really
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
manage their Finance as well
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the um some of them
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
don't have the same level of expertise
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
that you would see in a public school
 
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.850 align:start position:0%
that you would see in a public school
so

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
useful to give some discussion in
 
01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:15.860 align:start position:0%
consideration to
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
maybe new requirements that have to do
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
with financial management internal
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
controls of of charter schools in terms
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
of their financial management because
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
the advantage of that would be that we
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
could identify what schools were in
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
trouble before they get to the point
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
where they maybe will have to dissolve
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
or dissolve in when they are financially
 
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.870 align:start position:0%
or dissolve in when they are financially
insolvent

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
insolvent
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
because that's creates that's the
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
biggest issue and an example of that
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
having happened was the capital city
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
charter schools which my impression is
 
01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:57.860 align:start position:0%
that that's still not entirely resolved
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will approve
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
the section
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
about the charter committee
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
because what it will do is it will be an
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide transparency
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
accountability and clear guidance for
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
the disposal of Charter School assets
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
that were purchased with State funds
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
it will make it possible to identify
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
Financial instability before it becomes
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
Financial insolvency
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
and it will also have be an opportunity
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
to identify ways to minimize the
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
disruption to Charter School students
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and staff when a school closes
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
minor Corrections that are needed
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.810 align:start position:0%
for the committee
section

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:52.820 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
the Quorum number has to be changed
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
because it the way it's
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh worded right now every single member
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be there to have a quorum
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
so that's not necessary and needs to be
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
fixed and
 
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.950 align:start position:0%
fixed and
um

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
I don't have a specific
 
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.990 align:start position:0%
I don't have a specific
recommendation

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
for the due date I don't know if on
 
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
December 15th
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable or it should be
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
extended so
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's the end of my testimony I'll take
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question okay so I was thrown
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
off because I was looking at the wrong
 
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
number two like as Point number two in
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
your italics but you actually mean the
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
whole section that goes down to where it
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
starts committee is that correct yes so
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
so on the first page just get rid of
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
lines one through
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
16. okay and just have it start on 17
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's the two that's section two of the
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
bill okay follow up please yes thank you
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
then at this point all the dissolution
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
things that are in charter schools
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
charters for example are still in effect
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing that that works on
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
those this is just a committee
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
well one of the things that is really
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
complicated that I ran into is you know
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
I my impression from the Meet the
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
meeting that I had which included Sherry
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
brockburn who's the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
at administrative services and
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
um to people from Department of
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
Education Sherry rodburn said that
 
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:45.770 align:start position:0%
Education Sherry rodburn said that
um

01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
the the charitable
 
01:14:48.719 --> 01:14:51.110 align:start position:0%
the the charitable
division

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
that is resp now I forgot your question
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
what was your question
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
do the things that charter schools have
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
written as their dissolution policies
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
right now remain in effect yeah yes well
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes because they're there in in
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a requirement that's published
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
but they might not be like really legal
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
if they if they were questioned and the
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
biggest issue that I can see is that the
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
regulations related to 501c3s
 
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
are not aligned with the regulations
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
that are in State Statute the rsas
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
that say you can just you know write
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
your dissolution provision and
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
the the things that they wrote may not
 
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.689 align:start position:0%
the the things that they wrote may not
really

01:15:43.689 --> 01:15:43.699 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
comply with the 501c3 requirements or
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
either that or they don't comply with
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
state requirements so
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's a problem that's that's a big
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
part of the problem but the the other
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's also important that maybe we can
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
work out some way that there is warning
 
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
when a school is going to have to close
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
I mean you don't want to like you know
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
Christmas break during Christmas break
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
you found out that the schools insolvent
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to open up in
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
January we need to have warning of that
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
okay I'll follow up with this thing
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so it's my understanding that
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
the Char charitable trust handles these
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
they also handle the papers that 501c3's
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
file when they're there so they would
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
have caught something if they were
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
looking at their filing papers so are
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
you planning to work with the charitable
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
trust division as well
 
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
the if you look in here if you look in
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
the bill it says that it requires
 
01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:56.540 align:start position:0%
a line on the first page line 29
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
that a representative of the charitable
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
trust division from the Department of
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
Education the Department of Justice
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me

excuse me

01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
has to be available to the
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%

01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
done quite a bit of work uh including
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
meetings with administrative Services uh
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed uh education and um and
 
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.149 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed uh education and um and
um

01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
I believe it's is it still um um uh
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
attorney general Donovan over at
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
charitable trust no uh I I so we do have
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
charitable trust we have the director
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank you very much
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
because and and
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
um in the in the in the past Rick I'd
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
worked with um with um uh General
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
Donovan on um on a number of statutes
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
involving the merger and acquisition and
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
disposition of of um non-profit
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire and clearly
 
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
this is a very significant
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
um uh and very complex area in the law
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
and so uh so
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
um it was really more of a more of a
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
comment than a um than a question but my
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
question to you Sally would be
 
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
could you could you provide us with um
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
with the the amount I know it's not very
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
complicated deleting section one but uh
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
but you know if we have um if we have
 
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
support from administrative Services as
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
well as Department of Justice as well as
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education in um in
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
addressing this very complex portion of
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the law maybe there's a chance that um
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
that is that a study
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know could be done to uh to
 
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.290 align:start position:0%
um you know could be done to uh to
properly

01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
um you know document what the
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
requirements are for um um you know for
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
these um for these schools uh in the
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
event of dissolution
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
so the question part was can you can you
 
01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:14.699 align:start position:0%
provide us with uh with the amendment
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
that I think one of us would be happy
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
I don't think I can because I think that
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
to get to what you need uh I mean as
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
opposed I suppose if somebody could ask
 
01:19:28.199 --> 01:19:28.850 align:start position:0%
opposed I suppose if somebody could ask
um

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the chair
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
will trust to to get together and have a
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
meeting in in one or two meetings if
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
they could come up with a solution I
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
would no no I'm talking about the
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment just for the study committee
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
just for just to keep section two yeah
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
correct and we made section one keep
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
section two yeah we've got 100 bills to
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
get through oh I don't I totally
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
understand that if you can do the
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
legwork with with legislative services
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
oh okay oh that I absolutely can do that
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
do you want a little bit of time to
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
Let's uh we want to do and maybe you
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
want to have more discussion then
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a lot more discussion
 
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.970 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a lot more discussion
yeah

01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to have director Quinlan
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
um offer some you know there'll be
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions there yes I have questions
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I can we just went through something
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
like this not where Charter Schools but
 
01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:27.659 align:start position:0%
in the village District I live in our
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
fire station and property was donated
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
to the Village District water district
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
Haverhill corner
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
then the town wants to take it over the
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
town couldn't take it over because it
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
was written in the covenants from the
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
person who donated all this that nothing
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
could occur
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh going elsewhere if you choose to no
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
longer own this Village District of
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
Haverhill corner it will revert back to
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
the original owner
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
and so there's a there's a number of
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
questions here in which we need to
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
answer uh yeah and and uh we're getting
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
into the the not just the outfits that
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned near these departments
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
but justice as well yeah so um yeah
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that has to be
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
done on this so I I will help you in any
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
way that I can I certainly don't know
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
the answer to how you pull this all
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
together and because you can as you
 
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
understand it's complicated and there
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
are a lot of different covenants out
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
there probably I'm not familiar with it
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
but we have different types of charter
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
schools as well right I only love
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
versions and I looked at just 10 of them
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
I mean I didn't look at all 30 or
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
however many there are thank you very
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
much are there further questions
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
regular Public Schools district
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
Community public schools are non-profit
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
really aren't they
 
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.310 align:start position:0%
really aren't they
uh

01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
my understanding you know and like maybe
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
a lawyer could would tell you something
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
different is that for
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
um Public Schools they they are they are
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
a government entity and some of them is
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
probably common for them to have a
 
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.850 align:start position:0%
probably common for them to have a
separate

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:12.860 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
organization that
 
01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
um accepts
 
01:22:18.179 --> 01:22:20.149 align:start position:0%
um accepts
donations

01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
donations
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
or I think towns can accept donations
 
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
but then you have overseer of the trust
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
funds that kind of thing
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
so that structure they're they're not
 
01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
they are not 501 3cs a public school is
 
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
not a 501 3C but they can have 501 3C uh
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh Public School can have a 501c3 uh for
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
charitable donations or yes and the
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
money is completely separate it's not
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
part of the school budget or and it and
 
01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:55.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't maybe you can ask it like
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent and it doesn't have
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
taxpayer resourced money in it they're
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
not co-mingled for sure okay and I don't
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
is a lot of different angles and twists
 
01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
and all this so I think before we come
 
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
to conclusion that quickly it's not a
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
one pager
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%

really relies in part on the principle
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
that when a donor offers a gift to a
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
charity for a particular purpose that
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
particular purpose and that intent is
 
01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.930 align:start position:0%
particular purpose and that intent is
enforceable

01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
so charter schools are organized in New
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as private non-profit
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
charitable corporations that are exempt
 
01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:00.620 align:start position:0%
from federal income tax under Section
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
501c3 of the Internal Revenue code
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for tax-exempt
 
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
status under Section 501c3 of the
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code when a corporation
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
files its articles of agreement must
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
include a dissolution Clause that
 
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:23.219 align:start position:0%
indicates that upon dissolution the
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
assets shall be distributed either to
 
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.310 align:start position:0%
assets shall be distributed either to
another

01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
501c3 eligible Corporation or
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
organization or a government agency
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
charter schools in New Hampshire are
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
governed by their own Boards of trustees
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
and they're subject to the oversight of
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
our office they're required to submit a
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
registration application and thereafter
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
file annual reports with our office
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
in the event that they dissolve and some
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
of those charitable charter schools have
 
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:00.260 align:start position:0%
dissolved in the last year
 
01:26:04.129 --> 01:26:04.139 align:start position:0%
the charter school must submit a final
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
annual report with our office that
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
indicates where those charitable assets
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
have been distributed and one of the
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
roles of our office is to ensure that
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
the assets were distributed in
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
accordance with the terms of the
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
and um consistent with donor intent with
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
respect to any donor restricted funds so
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that Charter
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
School assets May consist not only of
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
assets they receive from the state but
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
also assets they may receive from
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
private sources
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
some of those gifts may be subject to
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
one or more specific restrictions on
 
01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
their use and the school has an
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to comply with the terms of
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
those restrictions for example if a
 
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
School receives a donation that's to be
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
used exclusively to build a playing
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
field or a building that property must
 
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
be used for those purposes
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
so in general when a New Hampshire
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
charitable Corporation dissolves it's
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
unrestricted charitable assets are
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
distributed in accordance with those
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement I mentioned
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
but certain donor restricted funds held
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
by charitable Corporation can't simply
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
be distributed in accordance with that
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
dissolution provision
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
for example if an individual donates a
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
building to a charter school for the
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of operating a school for
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
students in grades 7 through 12.
 
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
upon dissolution the state can't simply
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
sell the bill the schools simply can't
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
sell the building and give the assets to
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
the state or distribute the building to
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
another 501c3 that's because the school
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
accepted the restricted when he they
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
accepted that restricted gift they have
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
an obligation to comply with the terms
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
of that restriction that is enforceable
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
by our office uh in the charitable trust
 
01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.310 align:start position:0%
by our office uh in the charitable trust
unit

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
in most cases in order to change the
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
purpose or the administration of a
 
01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
restricted gift like that it requires a
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
trip to court
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
a petition for site pray it's called or
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
a petition for deviation in general
 
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.890 align:start position:0%
a petition for deviation in general
terms

01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
that's typically the way that a
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
restricted gift would be distributed so
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
it could not be returned to the state
 
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
because the state that it's not
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
consistent with the terms of of the the
 
01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.390 align:start position:0%
consistent with the terms of of the the
gift

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
gift
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature doesn't have the
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
authority to change the purpose or
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
administration of a restricted gift
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
so we note that the um discussion today
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
is really taught not talking about
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
existing Charter Schools but that's a
 
01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
really important distinction because the
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court has held
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
that the government can't change the
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
charter of an existing charitable
 
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
Corporation in order to assume control
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
over it that case which is cited in the
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I distributed was
 
01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
a case called Dartmouth College versus
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
Woodward and Daniel Webster actually
 
01:29:15.729 --> 01:29:15.739 align:start position:0%
argued on the part of Dartmouth College
 
01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
in that case the New Hampshire
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
legislature attempted to change the
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
charter and convert Dartmouth College
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
which was founded by a congregational
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
Minister and governed by its own Board
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
of Trustees
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
to a secular institution called
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth University
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
but the United States Supreme Court held
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
that Dartmouth College was not a civil
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
institution that could be employed in
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
the administration of government it was
 
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
a private charitable Institution
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
the court therefore found that the state
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
could not it had no authority to change
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
the charter of that private charitable
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
institution or change the purpose of any
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
of its charitable funds
 
01:29:59.810 --> 01:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned we're not taking a
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
position on this particular bill but
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I am so confused but
 
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.129 align:start position:0%
thank you I am so confused but
um

01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:13.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
so in the case of our Charter Schools
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire charter schools which
 
01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:21.620 align:start position:0%
are essentially private non-profit
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
is the when they receive money from our
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund is that
 
01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
considered a donation
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
is not this the same thing as a private
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
donation for a particular purpose so is
 
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.810 align:start position:0%
donation for a particular purpose so is
that

01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
does the state give
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
does the state on a regular basis
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
besides Charters give
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.689 --> 01:30:58.699 align:start position:0%
the state does offer grants to
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit charitable corporations
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
frequently and some of those grants are
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
subject to certain restrictions as well
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:31:09.179 --> 01:31:10.090 align:start position:0%
but the
the

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:10.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
but the money that we give per pupil
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
which is based on
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
on our educational trust fund
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
um is not a grant
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
is it a donation
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question and it's it's a
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
very charter schools are very unusual
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
animals there aren't a lot of Charters
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh comparable situations which is why we
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
raise some of these concerns when um we
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
were asked about this particular bill we
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it clear that they're
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
because it's a 501c3 it has certain
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
obligations under the the law and
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
subject to our jurisdiction but it may
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
also have other restrictions under the
 
01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
um uh their state grants or state
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
Charter as well I have one more just one
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
one question
 
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
um is this usual in other states I mean
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
do you know if um
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
because the there's charter schools in
 
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
every state is this a common setup for
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools I do not know the answer
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can try to check on that but
 
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know yet okay thank you sorry
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
further questions representative uh Luna
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
and Woodcock and then Milo thank you
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thank you very
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
much uh uh for uh for uh joining us this
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
morning with respect to a comment that
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
you made in the in the Dartmouth case I
 
01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
think you you suggested that that the
 
01:32:42.659 --> 01:32:43.490 align:start position:0%
think you you suggested that that the
court

01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.229 align:start position:0%
court
um

01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
said that the government could not
 
01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.129 align:start position:0%
said that the government could not
um

01:32:49.129 --> 01:32:49.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
you know require a disposition of assets
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh as part of taking over uh uh uh you
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
know the the that organization and uh
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
but but I was wondering
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
um could
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
um could the the could the state of New
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
apply some you know Provisions that
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
would either have to be included in um
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
in new
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
um School Charters as well as would be
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
read into existing School Chargers uh
 
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
Charters with respect to if it's if it's
 
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
not clear in the charter how you know
 
01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:35.420 align:start position:0%
what the dispositions would be how um
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
State dollars
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
um would be um would be taken care of in
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
a dissolution how private dollars
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
obviously the your your the charitable
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
trust division certainly if even if it's
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
not in the in the school Charter is
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
going to be read against a certain law
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
um it is respect to charitable donations
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
but but does the does the state have
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
some room to work with within the
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision and uh and uh
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
putting in place some policy to be
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
either included in Charters or read in
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
conjunction with existing Charters at
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
question the Dartmouth case dealt with
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
an existing charity so if you're talking
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
about uh the uh establishing a rule that
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
for uh future in order to be approved as
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
a charter school in the future then your
 
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
dissolution provision must indicate that
 
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
the asset shall be distributed to the
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
local government or the state
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
for the future if that's the condition
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
then I think that then the charter would
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
then be accepted on those terms then I
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
think that's okay for the future that
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
would not uh change the fact that any
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
privately donated funds with restricted
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
purposes would still follow the intent
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the donor and still have to go to
 
01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.030 align:start position:0%
of the donor and still have to go to
court

01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay with existing Charities though I
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
think that the court has made it pretty
 
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
clear that you the government can't
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
change the charter of an existing
 
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you very much Mr
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for the clarification there
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons this is so
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
important the chair would would probably
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
knows where I'm going with this is that
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
we've got several bills also that would
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
open up Charter Schools to be recipients
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
to State build School building Aid and
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
um and so if one of those TR if if such
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
an existing Charter School were to
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
receive state aid for construction of a
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
of a school building and then let's say
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
a handful of years later was um became
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
insolvent and uh and dissolved
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
How would how would those
 
01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:12.179 align:start position:0%
once State assets
 
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
um the uh be handled
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's jumping a little bit
 
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
but but would it be would it
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
I mean how would how would the
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
charitable trust division handle handle
 
01:36:27.239 --> 01:36:29.030 align:start position:0%
charitable trust division handle handle
that

01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:30.380 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
hard to speculate what that looks like
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
but I think that if um a gift is given
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
with a certain restrictions and
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and those conditions are met
 
01:36:44.209 --> 01:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
that's then that can go back to this to
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
the state if that's what the condition
 
01:36:49.490 --> 01:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
is the building shall be used for the
 
01:36:53.169 --> 01:36:53.179 align:start position:0%
charter school for as long as it remains
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
approved charter school after which it
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
returns to the to the state
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
thing something like that
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
further question represent whitcock good
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you both for
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
um two two questions uh the first one is
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
does doe uh confer with you oh it is
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
China school application to go through
 
01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:19.250 align:start position:0%
China school application to go through
you

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
um prior to be certified as approved by
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
Doe for initial so thank you for your
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
question no the the Department of
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
Education doesn't consult with us it's
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
not part of the process but it's my
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that they do take a look
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
at and um to determine whether or not
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
they are registered with our office so
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's not an official requirement but I
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
believe that they do look to see whether
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
or not they're registered and in good
 
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
standing with our office yeah and I
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
think it's a state board state board
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay everyone will have to depart
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative here I have one yes thank
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
you the second one during your uh verbal
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
testimony the oral testimony she said um
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the child school is
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
providing annual reporter view to you
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
can you just give us a quick glimpse of
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
what that might be in the report yes uh
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
the non-profit corporations that are New
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based must submit annual
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
reports to our office including
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
chartered schools that annual report
 
01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
sets forth certain information that we
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
review such as the current number the
 
01:38:30.850 --> 01:38:30.860 align:start position:0%
names of the board members
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
their financial situa information for
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
example if they file a 990 and they all
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
do they need to submit their 990 with
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
our office they also need to submit
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
their audited Financial reports because
 
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of them have Revenue
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
in excess of 2 million a year in
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
addition they provide certain
 
01:38:54.490 --> 01:38:54.500 align:start position:0%
information about their governance
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's been any
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest things like that
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
and then in the event that they dissolve
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
they also have to file an additional
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
attachment that sets forth where the
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
assets have been distributed oftentimes
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
and we prefer it before a charter school
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
or other non-profit dissolves they'll
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
contact our office and say this is what
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
our plan is and we say well do you have
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
any restricted assets and we talk about
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
where where those go okay thank you
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you master you're welcome
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
um my question really relates to the
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
asset allocation
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about earlier this
 
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.050 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about earlier this
morning

01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools receive state funding on
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
a per-pupil basis they receive donations
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
as we've heard testimony in Prior and
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
prior hearings here uh they're raising
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
anywhere from eight to ten percent of
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
their budget through fundraising
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
activities I want to focus on those two
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
elements there I'm not dealing with a uh
 
01:40:07.610 --> 01:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
a donor who says I'm going to build a
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
field for the school that's not what I'm
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
dealing with primarily operational costs
 
01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.189 align:start position:0%
dealing with primarily operational costs
here

01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
and they co-mingle those uh to
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
administer the program that's that's
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
there one day ultimately uh decide to
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
dissolve how do those various assets
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
then begin to uh get distributed to
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
wherever because you've got the
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
donations which are just generic
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
donations to help the administration not
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted and you've got the
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
state aid money that's coming in they
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
co-mingle to create a budget of three
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars let's say
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
how does how does one determine how that
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
gets allocated from the state vis-a-vis
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
that of private uh fundraising
 
01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:53.930 align:start position:0%
that of private uh fundraising
activities

01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question generally
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
they don't get allocated separately
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
those are considered to be unrestricted
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
funds and so those unrestricted funds
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
are distributed in accordance with the
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
terms of the Articles of agreement
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's generally the way it works it's
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
only where there are restricted funds so
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
if they're fundraising for a particular
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
purpose that is to build a field that
 
01:41:19.129 --> 01:41:19.139 align:start position:0%
might be a separate fund that's separate
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
that's a restricted fund for a
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
particular purpose that's where we come
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
in we protect the donor intent but with
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
respect to the other funds those are
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
considered to be unrestricted funds and
 
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:31.460 align:start position:0%
they follow the articles of agreement
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
yes is that then where the when does the
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
court come into the determination of the
 
01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
of the uh allocation the court comes in
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
with re with respect to restricted funds
 
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
for a particular purpose okay thank you
 
01:41:49.209 --> 01:41:49.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.609 --> 01:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for helping
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
us understand this or attempt to I have
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
you may have answered the first one but
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
are the current Charter Schools articles
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
of agreement in compliance with the
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
issues and concerns that are being used
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
the I haven't studied all of the
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement for all Charter
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
Schools but generally they provide that
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
the assets shall be distributed to
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
another 501c3 or a government entity
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's what they have to say in order to
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.010 align:start position:0%
comply with
um

01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
to to in order to be eligible for status
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
as a 501c3
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
organization some may specify which
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
government agency the money goes to or
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
which 501c3 entity it goes to but some
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
are just more General so I can't tell
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
you exactly what all of them say okay
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.930 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
so

01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it was within the law
 
01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.410 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it was within the law
that

01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
a closing charter school could give
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
their assets to a 501c3 that has nothing
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
to do with education
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
under the Articles of agreement that's
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
the way that they could
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
um distribute the fund
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
generally we try to step in in those
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases and
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
try to get them to distribute their
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
funds to an organization that's similar
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
to the purpose for which they were
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
established it's my understanding too
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
admit that I am not as familiar with
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools as maybe someone who
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
works for the Department of Education
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that there may
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
be something in one of the regulations
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
that requires that assets be distributed
 
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
which would be consistent with
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
the articles of agreement
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
so I have one unrelated different
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
question entirely can you please quickly
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
do it so on the question of Financial
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
instability preceding Financial
 
01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.490 align:start position:0%
instability preceding Financial
insolvency

01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
insolvency
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
does the trust division get involved to
 
01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
help a school that's not thriving
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
financially but isn't yet closing the
 
01:44:21.179 --> 01:44:22.189 align:start position:0%
financially but isn't yet closing the
doors

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
doors
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question oftentimes
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
when we receive an annual report or if
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
we receive a call for example from the
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education they may say uh
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
Gene you should be aware that this
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
school is not doing well financially in
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
that case what we'll do is we'll meet
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the board of directors and we'll
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
talk to the board about what their plans
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
are what are you going to try to do to
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
resolve this issue or are you going to
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
close and which and sometimes that's the
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
best case scenario is the the best thing
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
is is for them ultimately to close so
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
that they can distribute those assets to
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
another school that could use it to
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
benefit those same students so we do get
 
01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:10.460 align:start position:0%
involved whenever we hear about
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are in trouble and
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
we follow them closely
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of colleges in that
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
Realm yes that's true yes uh further
 
01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:28.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other pink cards on
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
that bill so we're going to conclude the
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
hearing on 5 50. we're going to take a
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
five minute stand up for everybody here
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come right back and start
 
01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.219 align:start position:0%
up uh the next uh bill which would be uh
 
01:45:44.219 --> 01:45:51.070 align:start position:0%
up uh the next uh bill which would be uh
382.

01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:17.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of
 
01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:39.109 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of
impossible

01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.119 --> 01:46:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
technology

01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:23.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.580 --> 01:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
experience

01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead with the next bill here it's uh
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
HP 382
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
this is an act authorizing local school
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
boards to give students release time for
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
participation in religious instruction
 
01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:32.780 align:start position:0%
and an elective course for the purpose
 
01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
purposes of satisfying curriculum

the purpose of satisfying curriculum
 
01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.830 align:start position:0%
the purpose of satisfying curriculum
requirements

01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
have we heard this one yeah we heard
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
well I guess you don't have to do it I
 
01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
believe there's a different rep on this
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
I believe the other one was rep garage
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
let's see the two that were very similar
 
01:54:54.239 --> 01:54:57.310 align:start position:0%
let's see the two that were very similar
382.

01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.199 --> 01:55:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
this vote if I recall correctly I
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
believe there was an email from the uh
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill asking the
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
committee to itl the bill because there
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
was a duplicate yeah yeah but there is a
 
01:55:44.649 --> 01:55:44.659 align:start position:0%
slight difference
 
01:55:44.659 --> 01:55:47.050 align:start position:0%
slight difference
yeah

01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:47.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
we've done all of them though right
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think we've got it covered
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:58.679 --> 01:56:02.810 align:start position:0%
thank you
everybody

01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:09.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
this happened though that happens when
 
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
you get so many bills coming in and our
 
01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
administrative support is you know John
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
down there juggling as well
 
01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
with many committees so uh something
 
01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:25.580 align:start position:0%
like this is bound to happen
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh the next bill was is at 10 o'clock
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
actually I'm I'm looking the wrong day
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
what is your uh what are we gonna do
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to exec anything
 
01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.050 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to exec anything
today

01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
we will well
 
01:56:53.119 --> 01:56:54.970 align:start position:0%
we will well
okay

01:56:54.970 --> 01:56:54.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
I misread the calendar because I thought
 
01:56:58.609 --> 01:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
we had some other ones here we've
 
01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
already had I thought we would be that
 
01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.169 align:start position:0%
already had I thought we would be that
enough

01:57:03.169 --> 01:57:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.179 --> 01:57:37.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
those people are not here we would not
 
01:57:42.649 --> 01:57:42.659 align:start position:0%
be exacting any bills today
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's the way we're going to
 
01:57:47.209 --> 01:57:47.219 align:start position:0%
funnel through we do it once we're going
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
to be known to do it again and that's
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know inappropriate you know
 
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
procedure here
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do we
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
so at we had a bill schedule for 634
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
this puts us back on schedule almost so
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's 10 40 that we're supposed to be
 
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
going into 634 relative to the students
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
participation in religious instruction
 
01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
to a satisfy elective curriculum
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
requirements see these are both very
 
01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.350 align:start position:0%
requirements see these are both very
similar

01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
your research out of the same data
 
01:58:25.199 --> 01:58:37.870 align:start position:0%
your research out of the same data
secure

01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.169 --> 01:58:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor of 634 yes that's correct
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
it was at the end of the day
 
01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:55.430 align:start position:0%
it was at the end of the day
here

01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%

elective requirements
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
you probably need to fill out a pink
 
01:59:35.639 --> 01:59:40.910 align:start position:0%
you probably need to fill out a pink
card

01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other pink cards
 
01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.649 --> 01:59:54.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair honorable members of
 
01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
the education committee uh for the
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Matt
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
Simon I represent Grafton district one
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
Littleton Lisbon Lyman Sugar Hill bath
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
and Monroe I apologize for my attire
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
today I was not anticipating on being on
 
02:00:08.330 --> 02:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
the state house I was doing work for my
 
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
other job I just happened to be here uh
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
in fact I was sitting down in the
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
cafeteria doing some work and noticed
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
this hearing and thought I would come up
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
to listen in but as nobody's here to
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
testify on it I figured I would step in
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm somewhat knowledgeable on
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
the topic I just wanted to make sure a
 
02:00:24.649 --> 02:00:24.659 align:start position:0%
few points were made
 
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
um the bill itself uh seeks to allow
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
students to leave the premises of a
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
public education facility for the
 
02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
purposes of religious instruction and
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
then receive credit for that instruction
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
as an elective
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
leaving school premises for the purposes
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
of a religious instruction is already
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional according to Zurich
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
versus colossian Supreme Court decision
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
although those courses cannot be had on
 
02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
school premises they can be had off
 
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
school premises so long as the cost for
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
transportation other costs associated
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
with it are not incurred by the taxpayer
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
they are incurred by whoever is offering
 
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
the course
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
this bill the only difference between
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
that and this bill from what I can see
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
is that it would then satisfy an
 
02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.330 align:start position:0%
is that it would then satisfy an
elective

02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:10.340 align:start position:0%
elective
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
credit for the school
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court is also ruled that
 
02:01:16.679 --> 02:01:18.229 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court is also ruled that
um

02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
that the state cannot uh show favoritism
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
of one religion over another including
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
secularism so I would argue that if an
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
elective is available as long as that
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
elective does not somehow otherwise
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
infringe upon the Constitution the free
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
exercise clause and salvation Clause
 
02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pertain here and the school
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
should be able to take those electives
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
as credit
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
so that's it in brief and I'm happy to
 
02:01:46.609 --> 02:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
take any questions that I might be able
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
to answer for you if you have any any
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Simon
 
02:01:51.649 --> 02:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and then represent
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you you probably don't
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill but down in her
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
first page line 27
 
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
there's it says enacting T capital T
 
02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
capital r capital e capital c capital A
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
and I have no idea what that stands for
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
would you mind if I just want to grab a
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
copy oh thank you so much uh I'm sorry
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative where was it
 
02:02:18.850 --> 02:02:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
all in cap letters
 
02:02:24.490 --> 02:02:24.500 align:start position:0%
that's the first page
 
02:02:26.890 --> 02:02:26.900 align:start position:0%
line 27
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I could answer that it's
 
02:02:32.689 --> 02:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
line one of the bill it's an acronym for
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
totally Educational Credit actually it
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
took me a while to find that thank you
 
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you for the
 
02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the answer
 
02:02:40.330 --> 02:02:40.340 align:start position:0%
representative appreciate that
 
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative is helpful
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're up thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
um is it would be correct and I think
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony on this before but
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
would it be correct that this doesn't
 
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
actually place any burden on the school
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
or financial burden on the taxpayers
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct yeah if I mean there
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be question uh constitutionally as
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
far as Supreme Court rulings as to
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
whether it would be constitutional if it
 
02:03:02.699 --> 02:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
whether it would be constitutional if it
did

02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
um although with the recent Kennedy
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
versus Remington decision and the
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
overtressman of London versus kutzman
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that might be questionable uh that might
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
fall differently
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but certainly as long as it doesn't
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
incur uh over into the taxpayer it's
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional according to Supreme
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
Court decisions thank you
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
please look at lines 23 through 30
 
02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.669 align:start position:0%
please look at lines 23 through 30
articles

02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
articles
 
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
um seven and eight
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
and comment or explain on the Merit or
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
lack thereof of the language there
 
02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:44.219 align:start position:0%
was a I'm sorry representative was that
 
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
on page on the first page of the bill
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
lines 23 through 30 the last two Roman
 
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
numeral points
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
besides with one of the largest cultural
 
02:03:58.129 --> 02:03:58.139 align:start position:0%
medicines in America I apologize I'll
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm not 100 sure on
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
lines 23-25 and I think I can speak to
 
02:04:22.609 --> 02:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
26 through 30 because they come up in
 
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional decisions at the Supreme
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
Court level
 
02:04:26.159 --> 02:04:27.109 align:start position:0%
Court level
um

02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
up until the 20th century education was
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
primarily done by religious institutions
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until the early 20th century
 
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
that it became compulsory for all
 
02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
students of a certain age to attend
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.169 align:start position:0%
public schools
um

02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
with it being compulsory and the nature
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the academics that are offered within
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
a school system just just by necessity
 
02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:49.820 align:start position:0%
by definition
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
those courses do take in turn some form
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
of religious instruction the Supreme
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
Court has pretty much recognized this
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's secularism if you define
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
secularism as
 
02:05:05.649 --> 02:05:05.659 align:start position:0%
um as a religious kind of belief system
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
let me give you an example because I'm
 
02:05:09.729 --> 02:05:09.739 align:start position:0%
sure that sounds very confusing
 
02:05:12.649 --> 02:05:12.659 align:start position:0%
if for example I was to bring a
 
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:14.219 align:start position:0%
Christian sexual education program into
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
a school system and basically teach that
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
sex should happen between a man and a
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
woman only within the confines of
 
02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
marriage that would be deemed
 
02:05:25.930 --> 02:05:25.940 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional on the merits that
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
it that's a religious belief on sexual
 
02:05:31.729 --> 02:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
behavior between two people
 
02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
um however the Supreme Court has also
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
said that the state can't undermine
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
religion in its teaching well if there's
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
any sexual education teaching in in a
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
state school at all you're going to end
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
up either promoting something or
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
undermining something so if a Christian
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
Student goes into a classroom in which
 
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
um something contrary to that it's fine
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
to have sex with whomever whenever
 
02:05:52.250 --> 02:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
whether you're married or not
 
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
um that teaching undermines a religious
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
belief as well and therefore is
 
02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
inherently religious So within a
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
compulsory system it's nearly impossible
 
02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
to keep a world viewer and ideology out
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's what that section
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
is referring to that we have to make it
 
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
equal for everybody and not just for one
 
02:06:13.609 --> 02:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
particular belief system
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
and once again to know to know cost of
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you again just to clarify
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
when you're referring to uh the
 
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
religious nature of secularism well I
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
think you might have been referring to
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court finding that secular
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
humanism is a religion is that what
 
02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
you're referring to uh yeah thank you
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the question representative and yes
 
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
that is what I'm referring to
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember the case off the top
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
of my head I apologize there's about a
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
dozen of them
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.109 --> 02:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
the people arguing uh for Religious
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
Freedom I guess um I can't remember all
 
02:06:51.649 --> 02:06:51.659 align:start position:0%
the details as far as that's concerned
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
but the people arguing for Religious
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
Freedom said well if you remove all
 
02:06:57.729 --> 02:06:57.739 align:start position:0%
other religion out of the school system
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
then you're basically making secularism
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
a religion and you can't make secular
 
02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
secularism secularism a religion to the
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
exclusion of other religions the Supreme
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
Court's response to that was at that
 
02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:13.129 align:start position:0%
Court's response to that was at that
time

02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:07:15.770 --> 02:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
um no we couldn't do that
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but we're not doing that and then
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
later on there came into question
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's what they were
 
02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
actually doing
 
02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and so especially with the more
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
recent Supreme Court decisions uh the
 
02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
question of how The Establishment Clause
 
02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
versus the free exercise clause is
 
02:07:33.169 --> 02:07:33.179 align:start position:0%
really really kind of changing and come
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
back under a question
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so yes under Supreme Court law it is
 
02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:40.010 align:start position:0%
um so yes under Supreme Court law it is
very

02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's arguable at the very least and
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
probable I think that secularism would
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
be looked at as a religion under those
 
02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:50.570 align:start position:0%
be looked at as a religion under those
definitions

02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you this is the
 
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
clarification for you a question or it
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
could be for the representative uh
 
02:08:02.089 --> 02:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
because I'm confused on line 17 on page
 
02:08:02.099 --> 02:08:03.290 align:start position:0%
because I'm confused on line 17 on page
two

02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh whereas talking that the course
 
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
credit is talking about earning credit
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
time may earn credit course credit for
 
02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.870 align:start position:0%
time may earn credit course credit for
participation

02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
participation
 
02:08:14.089 --> 02:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh so my question is
 
02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
so a student goes to a religious school
 
02:08:20.089 --> 02:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
for instruction off of public school
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
premises during school time
 
02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
and they earn credit just for going
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
just participation is uh I guess my
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
first it's my first question they don't
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to do anything to have to go
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
because I'm a representative
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question if you
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
look online 20 it says the State Board
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
of Education shall also adopt minimum
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
standards for class attendance necessary
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
to qualify for the credit right but
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's just the tenants okay yeah yeah
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
just for showing at that point they just
 
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
have to go yeah okay so I'm trying to
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
find out uh representative Ladd uh if
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
this earned credit goes toward the
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
graduation credit when all the person
 
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.609 --> 02:09:04.619 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a huge process to the
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
courses which are offered according to
 
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
education 306 where the mental standards
 
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
for public school approval of which a
 
02:09:14.689 --> 02:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
high school must offer I think at a
 
02:09:16.729 --> 02:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
minimum 43 different courses that's what
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
they have in their catalog to speak of
 
02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
course is offered you're required to
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
have a minimum of 20 credits to graduate
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
some school districts have more than
 
02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.189 align:start position:0%
some school districts have more than
that

02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
the process for approval as we've had
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
several bills come forward saying well I
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
took this course in school a on
 
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
transferring School B who approves that
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
the building principal does right but
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
you do it in conjunction with the or you
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
disapproved based upon if there's a
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
similar course which is similar to and
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
has those basic competencies built in
 
02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
within which are also in ed306 the word
 
02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
competencies so the process is such that
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
the State Board May set certain
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
standards but the the the
 
02:10:02.810 --> 02:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
approval of courses that are offered
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
through this local school are done by
 
02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
the local school board and the
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
administration within that board
 
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if I answered your
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
question but that's briefly how I
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
believe it happens and I really want to
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
understand the 23 I understand the 16
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
core requirements and those people I
 
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand I'm just trying to find out
 
02:10:23.649 --> 02:10:23.659 align:start position:0%
how a Class
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
A United States board can set up the
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
attendance requirements but how of
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
course that only requires sitting there
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
only requires sitting there uh it has no
 
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
other no other way to to
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
um uh verify competencies is uh required
 
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
to be part of a graduation requirement
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
except there's a graduate requirement
 
02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
does the bill has area SAS be modified
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
in order to really satisfy for example
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the State Board
 
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
shall also adopt minimal standards for
 
02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:57.350 align:start position:0%
shall also adopt minimal standards for
attendance

02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
is that going to be done through
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking if so rule making is not even
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
identified in the Bill thank you okay
 
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah represent Belcher thank
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just to piggyback off
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
of Representative woodcock's question
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
would you see legal or constitutional
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
issues arising from the state possibly
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
trying to develop competencies or
 
02:11:19.129 --> 02:11:19.139 align:start position:0%
guidelines around a religious education
 
02:11:19.139 --> 02:11:20.950 align:start position:0%
guidelines around a religious education
foreign

02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:25.129 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

02:11:25.129 --> 02:11:25.139 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
um if you if you really want to
 
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
understand this issue you do have to do
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of reading on it
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
um one of the main contentions that came
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
up when the when the state decided to
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
Institute compulsory education
 
02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
um in which everybody had to pay
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars into it and then
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
um send their kids or pay subsequently
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
extra money to be outside was that they
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
basically took over a religious role in
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
the society at the time and so the
 
02:11:54.290 --> 02:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in the 1948 case basically
 
02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.330 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in the 1948 case basically
stated

02:11:55.330 --> 02:11:55.340 align:start position:0%
stated
 
02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:56.990 align:start position:0%
stated
that

02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.970 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
Church education whether it's parochial
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
through the Catholic church or you know
 
02:12:04.609 --> 02:12:04.619 align:start position:0%
about this school or whatever was really
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
an extension of that church
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
um because it performed certain Church
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
related functions
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
um where the state could not step in and
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
create its own church according to the
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
con you know the Federal Constitution uh
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
in competition to other churches and
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
then require taxpayer funds to go into
 
02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:24.350 align:start position:0%
then require taxpayer funds to go into
it

02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and then Force everybody to go to
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
their church or pay extra to go to their
 
02:12:30.169 --> 02:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
own church they did by extension create
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of tension and conflict when
 
02:12:33.609 --> 02:12:33.619 align:start position:0%
they did the with the school system
 
02:12:36.169 --> 02:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
because they did go into direct
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
competition with educational schools and
 
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
so there's always been this tension
 
02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
between the two as to what institutes
 
02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
the role of the state and what
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
institutes the role of the religion how
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
the free exercise clause your ability to
 
02:12:49.609 --> 02:12:49.619 align:start position:0%
practice your own religion when in a
 
02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
school building comes into play with a
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
teacher's role is what they have the
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
freedom to do in their classroom when
 
02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
religion comes into play because when
 
02:12:59.810 --> 02:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
you say that the state is basically
 
02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:00.649 align:start position:0%
you say that the state is basically
um

02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
the state is overseeing the
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
establishment of religion through the
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
school system or trying to keep that
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
from happening in that way in total
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
competition with the church itself
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
um those lines get those lines get
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
really really blurry really really fast
 
02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that with zoroth and Claus
 
02:13:21.649 --> 02:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
and what they said essentially was there
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
has to be a place for Religious
 
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
Education to exist during the school day
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
it can happen off of site and
 
02:13:29.219 --> 02:13:30.229 align:start position:0%
it can happen off of site and
um

02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
so long as it's not on the tax Paradigm
 
02:13:35.689 --> 02:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I don't know that the school
 
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
that the state would have any say in
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
particular on what the religion could or
 
02:13:42.169 --> 02:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
could not teach during that time I think
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
that would go against the Constitution
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the difficulty in
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
marriaging these two things together
 
02:13:51.290 --> 02:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and one of the reasons why we've had
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
so much trouble with it in the past
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.930 --> 02:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
for not thinking what you're going to do
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
today Pat you certainly got you know
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
like thank you so much for your time I
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
apologize for extending your day a
 
02:14:06.649 --> 02:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
little bit more but I think it's it is
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
an important concept and I hope that the
 
02:14:09.169 --> 02:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
committee gives it some serious
 
02:14:10.850 --> 02:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much thank
 
02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:13.010 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much thank
you

02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.689 --> 02:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
is there anybody in the public here that
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to this bill
 
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
if not
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're closing it down
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go on the 552
 
02:14:31.729 --> 02:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
relative making incentive grants for
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
school districts that improve in certain
 
02:14:35.649 --> 02:14:35.659 align:start position:0%
assessment scores
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
welcome to education thank you Mr chair
 
02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
happy to be here uh very impressed by
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative Simon just coming out of
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
nowhere and doing what he did uh he's
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to stay around and introduce
 
02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:04.460 align:start position:0%
this bill perhaps or we're not
 
02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh for the record uh again I'm
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett of Merrimack
 
02:15:12.649 --> 02:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
District for the beautiful towns of
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
Canterbury and Loudoun
 
02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
so uh to get right through this I
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
believe in public education served us
 
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
well over the many years I went to
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
Public Schools my kids had a great
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
Public School experience or experiences
 
02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
here in Concord
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
I served in a public school board I
 
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
taught in public post-secondary
 
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
institutions I served two terms in this
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee so public education is a big
 
02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:35.099 align:start position:0%
part of my journey and I care about it
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
and I see it being in trouble
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
the test scores are down public support
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
is down enrollment is down partly due to
 
02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
demographics but for other reasons as
 
02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:45.410 align:start position:0%
demographics but for other reasons as
well

02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh homeschooling members have
 
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed charter schools are
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
proliferated uh the response to the the
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
new EFA option has been overwhelming so
 
02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
why are all these things happening and
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are a number of reasons
 
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
for all this
 
02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:10.569 align:start position:0%
for all this
Bruno

02:16:10.569 --> 02:16:10.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll come back we'll be happy
 
02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
to come back to that
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
um but uh my feeling
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that we need to have some do some new
 
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
thinking we hear a lot about Innovation
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
and education and to some folks that
 
02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
means like taking the walls down in
 
02:16:33.169 --> 02:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
schools and that type of innovation but
 
02:16:35.410 --> 02:16:35.420 align:start position:0%
honestly again having been in this
 
02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:37.700 align:start position:0%
education culture
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
in some areas Innovation just is really
 
02:16:46.610 --> 02:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
hard to to manifest itself
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
in public education where public
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
spending is now approaching twenty
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student per year
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars per student per
 
02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars per student per
year

02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
it is a perception fair or not that
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
schools don't celebrate or promote
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
achievement as as they might uh some
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
schools have eliminated valedictorians
 
02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
some schools have done Away With Honors
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
tracks so there's that perception that
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
many schools teach to the lowest common
 
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
denominator we've all heard that how
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
true is it I'm not sure every district
 
02:17:18.310 --> 02:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
is different
 
02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh there's a perception that the lowest
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
common denominator is tied in with with
 
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
equity and there's a fear that sometimes
 
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
proselytizing takes place that schools
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
focus on less the school focus is
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
shifted away from academics and into
 
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
other areas uh diversity Equity
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
inclusion climate change on and on so
 
02:17:43.370 --> 02:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
we've heard parents tell us in some
 
02:17:45.770 --> 02:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
cases in this Committee in tears
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
that their kids are not being challenged
 
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
in school so many of us want to look at
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
this address this help this uh
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
and we've I think we've made some some
 
02:17:59.929 --> 02:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
nice steps I think the Unified sports
 
02:18:01.849 --> 02:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
measure the gifted student measure the
 
02:18:05.330 --> 02:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
Civics bill that are all law uh are good
 
02:18:08.089 --> 02:18:08.099 align:start position:0%
steps that parents applaud
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
so I know this committee gets about 100
 
02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
bills a year uh but again how many of
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
those bills deal with teaching or
 
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
learning or pedagogy and by education I
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
mean learning
 
02:18:20.929 --> 02:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
I mean achievement
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
I mean academic excellence
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
um and this is a bill that's about
 
02:18:31.969 --> 02:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
learning and achievement HP 552
 
02:18:34.849 --> 02:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
establishes a fund whereby the doe can
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
create a mechanism to reward schools
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that demonstrate measurable Improvement
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
in math achievement
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
um representative Hobson and I chatted
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
with some Folks At Doe about this
 
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
incentive Grant concept a couple years
 
02:18:53.089 --> 02:18:53.099 align:start position:0%
ago and it was talked about formulas and
 
02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
in which assessments to use and how to
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
implement et cetera et cetera
 
02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
who eventually realized that statute
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily the place to put in
 
02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:07.139 align:start position:0%
overly prescriptive definitions as to
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
how to move this measure forward we saw
 
02:19:13.009 --> 02:19:13.019 align:start position:0%
our job is simply to raise awareness
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
about this approach to celebrate
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
Improvement and encourage Improvement to
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
shine a light on the concept of
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
rewarding achievement to find funding
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
and to task doe with working out the
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
details in cooperation with relevant
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so once a formula is
 
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
established and published then then
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
schools would not compete against each
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
other in this bill
 
02:19:40.849 --> 02:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
came up a year last term so I'm
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
repeating all this stuff that some of
 
02:19:43.389 --> 02:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
you have already heard
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
it's not about competing against other
 
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
schools it's simply about trying to
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
improve their own results based on their
 
02:19:52.849 --> 02:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
own baselines
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
so there's only rewards here there's no
 
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
punishment of course you know there'll
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
be some statistical issues it has come
 
02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
up before what if a school is already
 
02:20:03.610 --> 02:20:03.620 align:start position:0%
performing relatively High
 
02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
then the the room for improvement
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
according to the formula will be
 
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
different from a school that's
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
performing relatively poorly which I
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
totally understand that of course but
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this initiative the
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
schools that are really doing really
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
poorly will more easily qualify for a
 
02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:22.610 align:start position:0%
poorly will more easily qualify for a
reward

02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
reward
 
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
so again we shouldn't let the perfect be
 
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
the enemy of the good
 
02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure all kinds of questions will
 
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
again come up which is fine that's why
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're here and I see representative
 
02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
Simon is left unfortunately
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
hoping he might stick around
 
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
so uh we in the past we've had a formula
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
where we give schools school districts
 
02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
money if they're third grade reading
 
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
scores are down
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
so how well do we monitor the results of
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
the many millions of dollars that we've
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
sent to schools with low third grade
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
reading scores
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh is there much in the way of
 
02:20:56.399 --> 02:20:57.770 align:start position:0%
uh is there much in the way of
accountability

02:20:57.770 --> 02:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
folks who want
 
02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
charter schools to be accountable
 
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
for their spending fairly asked about
 
02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:06.020 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that also apply to the third
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
grade reading scores and all the money
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
that is directed that way is there data
 
02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
on how this extra money is used
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
because the extra spending made a
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
difference with the third graders
 
02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
because the extra money in fact gone
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
to reading programs as one would assume
 
02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
it would that was the reason that
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
they're giving money to schools with a
 
02:21:32.929 --> 02:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
low third grade scores
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
some see that as a progress incentive
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I get that
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
schools do poorly give them money
 
02:21:43.969 --> 02:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
we want to think that we could also have
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
room for a small program where schools
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
do well
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
and they get rewarded so back days b552
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
so if incentivizing achievement
 
02:21:55.849 --> 02:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
Improvement results in a school winning
 
02:21:59.570 --> 02:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
a 50 000 reward or award what will that
 
02:22:01.849 --> 02:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
mean number one it means a nice chunk of
 
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
money for the district to spend as it
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
wishes number two it means that the
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
school winning award will have reason to
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
celebrate the whole school community
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
self-esteem morale Pride could only
 
02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
improve number three parents would be
 
02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:18.650 align:start position:0%
improve number three parents would be
thrilled

02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
thrilled
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
if the school that their child or
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
children went to uh won an award because
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
of improvements in this area parents
 
02:22:29.570 --> 02:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
would love that number four lessons can
 
02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
be learned and shared when when when
 
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:33.490 align:start position:0%
be learned and shared when when when
when

02:22:33.490 --> 02:22:33.500 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:22:37.309 --> 02:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
so folks might ask how how did if a
 
02:22:40.370 --> 02:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
school if this gets into play a place in
 
02:22:42.770 --> 02:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
a school improves their scores and some
 
02:22:45.050 --> 02:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
folks will say so what happened how did
 
02:22:46.849 --> 02:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
you improve your scores
 
02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of the a cool thing
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
about this if it moves forward maybe the
 
02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
school created a math team
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
like the school I once taught at had
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
that went to math meets maybe they
 
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
created some sort of innovative peer
 
02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:02.870 align:start position:0%
created some sort of innovative peer
tutoring

02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
tutoring
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
initiative maybe they created a math
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
club that might involve alumni parents
 
02:23:11.450 --> 02:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
Engineers technicians accountants people
 
02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
use math
 
02:23:14.809 --> 02:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
who can speak to the relevance and you
 
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
value and utility of Matt again I and
 
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
for many students say what do I need to
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
know this algebra stuff I mean I'm never
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
going to need that well
 
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to help students
 
02:23:28.130 --> 02:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
understand the utility and the value of
 
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
math on and on all kinds of
 
02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
possibilities and whatever truly
 
02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
effective approaches that award-winning
 
02:23:36.770 --> 02:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
schools develop can be shared and
 
02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:38.030 align:start position:0%
schools develop can be shared and
emulated

02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
emulated
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
and finally this goes into his last year
 
02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
was senatorium study it was part of the
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee they met several times and
 
02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time on this one of
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
the changes that we made reflected some
 
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
input we get to specifically focus on
 
02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:52.730 align:start position:0%
input we get to specifically focus on
math

02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
math
 
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee voted to recommend
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
OTP and then in October the soil
 
02:23:59.929 --> 02:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
committee or the education Committee in
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
October uh endorsed the OTP
 
02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the subcommittee
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
so I hope that the time that people
 
02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
spend in in subcommittees and then with
 
02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
subsequent full committee endorsements I
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
hope that means something otherwise you
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
know why would anyone want to work on
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee if all that work is not
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
is from not
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
we I think we need that new paradigm
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
people are watching and others will
 
02:24:28.490 --> 02:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
watch later and they're hoping that we
 
02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
can do some stuff that can really make a
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
difference and I'd be happy to take
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
very much representative Moffett are
 
02:24:37.490 --> 02:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
there questions representative cascadden
 
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:24:41.450 --> 02:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett uh it's
 
02:24:43.490 --> 02:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
definitely recognizing good work is so
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
very important and I'm sure there are
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
more successes than we even give credit
 
02:24:49.969 --> 02:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
for right so my question is how could
 
02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
this bill be Equitable in Awards with
 
02:24:55.849 --> 02:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
districts who can afford full Staffing
 
02:24:57.650 --> 02:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
in a math department versus those
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
districts who can't afford the full
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
Staffing sure thank you for the question
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I kind of touched on that a little
 
02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
bit because I acknowledge that
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
difference law schools are different
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
some are in different places some have
 
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
more resources and I think that it's my
 
02:25:15.290 --> 02:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
earlier comment in that area a school
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
that lacks resources that uh has more
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
room to improve they really have an
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
advantage I think over schools that are
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
already performing well they have the
 
02:25:26.929 --> 02:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
resources and so getting back to
 
02:25:29.570 --> 02:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
Innovation schools that maybe lack those
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
resources this is an opportunity if this
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
gets into place to pull in as I said
 
02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
parents uh statisticians and years
 
02:25:42.590 --> 02:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
whatever and and pull them in to be part
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the process of raising awareness and
 
02:25:49.010 --> 02:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
and focusing attention on that so I'm
 
02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
saying your point and and hopefully I
 
02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
explained it enough a couple times to
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that schools are different
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that that shouldn't stop us from
 
02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
trying to give doe a chance to put a
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
formula into place
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for other questions from the
 
02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:08.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for other questions from the
committee

02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning everybody
 
02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
didn't take your advice
 
02:26:21.969 --> 02:26:21.979 align:start position:0%
that being said Mike I'm looking at wine
 
02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
8789 on the page one of the bill uh and
 
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
it talks about the student performance
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
Improvement if I recall build some of
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
this last session uh it dealt with
 
02:26:38.570 --> 02:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
providing those with me on my page
 
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
the main page
 
02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh it's under number two the that that
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
area last time it took talked about
 
02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
taking schools are doing well
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
and giving him a reward for doing well
 
02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
basically helping those that are good to
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
be better I didn't make any uh
 
02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of those before are
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
getting better
 
02:27:01.969 --> 02:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
um but I'm trying to determine if this
 
02:27:03.650 --> 02:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
is the exact same language because I'm
 
02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:06.620 align:start position:0%
reading it differently in my mind uh
 
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
when I look at lines eight and nine that
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
says it talks about uh test scores which
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
documents Improvement so the intent of
 
02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
this bill equal for school districts are
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
doing very very poorly and show
 
02:27:24.530 --> 02:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
Improvement equally eligible for this
 
02:27:27.050 --> 02:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
fund or it's just school districts are
 
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
already doing well and it's a reward for
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
doing well sure thank you for the
 
02:27:34.490 --> 02:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
question it's it's one that we try to
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
speak to before uh and it's a good
 
02:27:40.490 --> 02:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
question and it brings us back to the
 
02:27:42.889 --> 02:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
formula that uh
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
is not part of this legislation uh
 
02:27:49.490 --> 02:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
formula TBD to be determined by the
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with input from
 
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.690 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with input from
stakeholders

02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:54.849 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
um

02:27:54.849 --> 02:27:54.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
every school if this moves forward uh I
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate the formula would establish
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
establish a criteria in other words a
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
baseline will take a year of math scores
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
in whatever year
 
02:28:12.290 --> 02:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
and then that's the Baseline so if they
 
02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
improve by uh five percent ten percent
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um whatever the formula arrives at then
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
every school competes only against
 
02:28:25.809 --> 02:28:25.819 align:start position:0%
itself so uh whenever the Baseline score
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
Baseline accumulative score is four math
 
02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
scores then if they again as you just
 
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
said is improved by certain percentage
 
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
they'll get the the reward the the
 
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
tricky part about that is uh the good
 
02:28:43.210 --> 02:28:43.220 align:start position:0%
questions like that's a good question
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
about the formula
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:28:50.410 --> 02:28:50.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of arriving at the formula
 
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's something that we need as I said
 
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to have the
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
latitude to develop
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
um is it when we first started working
 
02:29:02.450 --> 02:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
in this we we we're dealing with that
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
type of question we're trying to come up
 
02:29:07.309 --> 02:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
with formulas and prescriptive language
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
we finally figured out that the way to
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
move this forward is to find some
 
02:29:17.809 --> 02:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
funding for it uh get it in the statute
 
02:29:20.929 --> 02:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
and then instead of getting down in the
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
weeds and putting the statute the
 
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
formula trust doe to uh uh come up with
 
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
a formula that that works if that
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
addresses your question somewhat
 
02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
addresses your question somewhat
um

02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward I'd like to
 
02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit based on uh rep
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Wilcox question
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
um obviously the formula will be left
 
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Education but it's
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
pretty clear right here in language
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
um that the metric being measured is not
 
02:29:57.650 --> 02:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
to be how good a school is doing but
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
Improvement correct
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
so that said the schools doing the not
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
best the the worst you could say who
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
have the most room to improve
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
are the most likely to receive Grant
 
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
because they have the most room to
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
improve would that be correct yes I
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
think I tried to State something that
 
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
effect earlier yes yes thank you
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you representative
 
02:30:26.330 --> 02:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
um the the grants which the school
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
district receives are and I liken it a
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
little bit to what we received the state
 
02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
650 million dollars NASA money and Etc
 
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
all the stabilization grants we received
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
there are some uses within that that the
 
02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
district had to comply with in order to
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
use the money
 
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
how are you going to or is it your
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
thought that a district not received
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
this grant money then use it to fix our
 
02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
roof or should it be used for
 
02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:57.170 align:start position:0%
roof or should it be used for
instruction

02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
sure and again uh after
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes this bill will belong
 
02:31:04.250 --> 02:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
to this committee and obviously the
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee can can amend it or not as it
 
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
wishes my personal vision is that the
 
02:31:11.809 --> 02:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
reward go to the district and they can
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want with it it's a
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
local control issue and the thing is if
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
they get 50 you know there could be
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
twenty fifty thousand dollar Awards if
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
if this million dollars uh moves forward
 
02:31:28.610 --> 02:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
and my feeling is that uh they could the
 
02:31:30.410 --> 02:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
schools could use it for anything they
 
02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
want locally now if the committee wanted
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
to uh get in the weeds a little bit and
 
02:31:39.650 --> 02:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
require that the award or the reward be
 
02:31:42.429 --> 02:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
uh dedicated to
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
something academic or math I mean that
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
would be up to you but again my vision
 
02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
is just reward the schools and let the
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
districts uh do what they want with the
 
02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:52.670 align:start position:0%
districts uh do what they want with the
award

02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
award
 
02:31:54.889 --> 02:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
they can't put a monument up front to
 
02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
represent a Moffat I think they could
 
02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
that that that is a local control
 
02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:02.410 align:start position:0%
that that that is a local control
decision

02:32:02.410 --> 02:32:02.420 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:32:04.670 --> 02:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
representing cordial
 
02:32:07.010 --> 02:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
like you're taking my question I'm just
 
02:32:10.130 --> 02:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
curious as to the reasoning
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
um as to why this is limited to
 
02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
mathematics and doesn't include like
 
02:32:18.010 --> 02:32:18.020 align:start position:0%
reading and language arts Improvement
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and the answer is
 
02:32:25.929 --> 02:32:25.939 align:start position:0%
that uh as part of the interim study
 
02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
process we get some input from some uh
 
02:32:31.910 --> 02:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
esteemed people who suggested that we
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
narrow the focus to math so that's so
 
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
that came about but uh if the committee
 
02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
so the bill is math specific if the
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to broaden that again
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the to the committee
 
02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr chair
 
02:32:54.889 --> 02:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
yep and I do want to just say that when
 
02:32:54.899 --> 02:32:56.290 align:start position:0%
yep and I do want to just say that when
representative

02:32:56.290 --> 02:32:56.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:59.090 --> 02:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
from the North Conway area said he was
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
glad he didn't take my advice that was
 
02:33:02.929 --> 02:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
not an academic issue that had to do
 
02:33:06.770 --> 02:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
with the uh the Super Bowl and and uh
 
02:33:09.790 --> 02:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia not winning I think
 
02:33:12.889 --> 02:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
have a good one
 
02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh Brian Hawkins from the Nea New
 
02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
okay uh Brian Hawkins from the Nea New
Hampshire

02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:26.690 --> 02:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins representing Nea New
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today uh the uh State's
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
education dollars that it has available
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
to them are are very precious and as we
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
know they are not uh unlimited as this
 
02:33:42.889 --> 02:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
committee well knows as you're looking
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
to uh see how to improve the state
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
funding formula for uh for an adequate
 
02:33:52.250 --> 02:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
education if the state has uh by the way
 
02:33:54.349 --> 02:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in opposition to the bill
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
I forgot to state that at the front
 
02:33:58.610 --> 02:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
um the state has a million dollars to
 
02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
spend uh with regard to improving
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
um performance on mathematics I think it
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
would be better spent first to make sure
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
that there are enough available Math
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
teachers and paraprofessionals in our
 
02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:14.450 align:start position:0%
teachers and paraprofessionals in our
schools

02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
um before we uh appropriate it for this
 
02:34:21.710 --> 02:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
type of a program
 
02:34:24.050 --> 02:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
um there are as we know there's a
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
shortage of paraprofessionals and other
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
staff that we've discussed in this
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
02:34:31.730 --> 02:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and helping school districts making
 
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
making sure that there are qualified
 
02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
individuals who are able to help our
 
02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:37.670 align:start position:0%
individuals who are able to help our
students

02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:34:40.370 --> 02:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
um the legislature ought to prioritize
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
that first making sure that they have
 
02:34:45.849 --> 02:34:45.859 align:start position:0%
the necessary equipment to learn
 
02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:49.220 align:start position:0%
the math science stem skills
 
02:34:50.929 --> 02:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh broadening an ELO program that they
 
02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
might have or want to start
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
I think that would be maybe a more
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate usage of the million dollars
 
02:35:07.010 --> 02:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
that this bill is suggesting uh to to
 
02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate so uh
 
02:35:12.170 --> 02:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'll close my testimony there and happy
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I got a question for
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
you is it wise for a school district to
 
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
use one-time Grant Monies
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
for activities which may involve labor
 
02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
or ongoing expenses
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
uh I will I will tell you anytime
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
um that type of expenditure is requested
 
02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
it is often met with hesitancy because
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
of that um very reason that one time uh
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
the one-time funds and so
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
I would say no so in follow-up if you
 
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
were a building School Board member or
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
School District Board member or a a
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
principal that received this grant could
 
02:35:57.170 --> 02:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
you find ways to use money such as this
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
to towards instruction or curriculum on
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
a one-time basis in your school
 
02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
I think it I think it would be difficult
 
02:36:07.550 --> 02:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of schools have
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
been doing I think uh with some of the
 
02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
one-time funds that they've been
 
02:36:14.929 --> 02:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
receiving uh have been attempting to use
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
those funds in ways that don't uh
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
encumber uh long-term
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
um unsustainable expenditures but uh I
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
think that there are ways to uh address
 
02:36:31.130 --> 02:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the legislation
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about this
 
02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
afternoon subcommittee there I think
 
02:36:37.330 --> 02:36:37.340 align:start position:0%
there are one-time usages of funds that
 
02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
would be more written thank you for the
 
02:36:42.540 --> 02:36:44.830 align:start position:0%
would be more written thank you for the
questions

02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:46.450 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:46.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
a clarification I don't um for your
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
comments I must have missed that I don't
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
see where they said this is only one
 
02:36:55.490 --> 02:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
time funds to the school
 
02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
my question was whether it should be
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
used for one-time activities or
 
02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
activities which are going to require
 
02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
dollars in later years where we know
 
02:37:07.309 --> 02:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
that the grant money is a one-time deal
 
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
but okay to clarify that then but in
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
this particular request it doesn't say
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
the school couldn't receive it annually
 
02:37:17.330 --> 02:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
if they win right
 
02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
that'd be great if they could get it
 
02:37:21.650 --> 02:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
okay it's not a one-time request I guess
 
02:37:23.450 --> 02:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's my point and
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here that stipulates
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the school can only get it once I
 
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
think it's just fishing you can't rely
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
on unless I missed it here it's it's
 
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
going to be money's appropriate for our
 
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
biennium so this thing is it an ongoing
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
deal for buying them after buying
 
02:37:39.050 --> 02:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
anything I don't know I see what you
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
mean okay thank you
 
02:37:45.170 --> 02:37:45.180 align:start position:0%

02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%

my question
 
02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
is this type of program in place in
 
02:37:56.889 --> 02:37:56.899 align:start position:0%
other schools I mean in other states
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm aware of legislation that has
 
02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
been filed in other states but uh I'm
 
02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
not aware of other states that have a
 
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
program like this
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
um before you right now Hospital 371 uh
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
is um is is very timely and I'll get
 
02:39:07.610 --> 02:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
into uh to exactly why that is but uh
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
but but before I get into that I want to
 
02:39:12.889 --> 02:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about well I want to
 
02:39:15.889 --> 02:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
sort of set the stage as to um as to how
 
02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
our public schools are doing how our our
 
02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
public school students are doing across
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
the state and um you know before I was
 
02:39:27.950 --> 02:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
on the um uh education committee I
 
02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:29.540 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of
 
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the uh the nape scores
 
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
and our our state assessment
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
um uh tests and there have been some
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
changes over the last um uh handful of
 
02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
years uh including what we use to uh to
 
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh assess how our students are doing at
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
the 11th grade now we're using the SAT
 
02:39:47.399 --> 02:39:48.889 align:start position:0%
the 11th grade now we're using the SAT
tests

02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:48.899 align:start position:0%
tests
 
02:39:52.370 --> 02:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
um uh to do that but um but you know
 
02:39:55.010 --> 02:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
going back quite a while New Hampshire
 
02:39:57.710 --> 02:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
students perform among the best in the
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
um in the country and um uh but but
 
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
recently and when I talk about best in
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
the con among the best in the country
 
02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about top five and I'm
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
talking Statewide I'm not saying every
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
student in every District or even the
 
02:40:14.090 --> 02:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
average student in every district is
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
performing uh tops in the country but
 
02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide are our average student
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
performance is uh is right up there uh
 
02:40:25.969 --> 02:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
tops in the tops among uh among all
 
02:40:27.889 --> 02:40:27.899 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
during and and since the pandemic
 
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:33.290 align:start position:0%
during and and since the pandemic
um

02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:34.969 --> 02:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
um you know we've probably seen some
 
02:40:34.979 --> 02:40:36.110 align:start position:0%
um you know we've probably seen some
slippage

02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
slippage
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
um in that and I think there are other
 
02:40:40.730 --> 02:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
factors that that probably contributed
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
to has has contributed to that too such
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
as the number of new programs that have
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
been introduced over the last few years
 
02:40:49.490 --> 02:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
that have so little accountability and
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
oversight that um that it's hard to tell
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
whether they're even relevant to uh to a
 
02:40:57.650 --> 02:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
public education but um but even with
 
02:40:59.570 --> 02:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
all that even with the pandemic even
 
02:41:01.969 --> 02:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
with some of these unaccountable
 
02:41:05.150 --> 02:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
um uh programs without any oversight our
 
02:41:07.490 --> 02:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
kids are still way above the national
 
02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
average and um and New Hampshire is
 
02:41:13.790 --> 02:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
among a small number of states that uh
 
02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
that that you know receive that
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
distinction uh in the uh in the on the
 
02:41:22.610 --> 02:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
nape website and you can you know take a
 
02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
look at look it up um naep and um and
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's also I think referred to by
 
02:41:32.570 --> 02:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
the um by the U.S department of Ed as
 
02:41:37.130 --> 02:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
the the nation's um report card and uh
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
and so our our on average our students
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um perform really well
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
um the problem is it's just not
 
02:41:49.130 --> 02:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
happening everywhere and um there is a
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
strong correlation and we learned this
 
02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
in our study uh back in 2020. strong
 
02:41:56.929 --> 02:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
correlation between how students are
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
performing and um and pockets of uh of
 
02:42:04.490 --> 02:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
of families in uh with low income low
 
02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
social economics uh situations and lack
 
02:42:11.650 --> 02:42:11.660 align:start position:0%
of Community Resources and so um
 
02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
a little policy
 
02:42:17.150 --> 02:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
a booklet called policy points which I
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
think probably everybody received over
 
02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
the last month or so and just put out
 
02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
every um every couple years by the New
 
02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
 
02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
actually makes a uh makes a policy
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
um comment on this and uh and it says by
 
02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
directing more resources to districts
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
with lower property values and students
 
02:42:40.490 --> 02:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
with lower incomes the state could help
 
02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
address issues of education and equity
 
02:42:45.170 --> 02:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
which is student outcomes and strengthen
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Workforce future so you
 
02:42:50.590 --> 02:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
can see how important how we go about
 
02:42:53.929 --> 02:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know offering public education is
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
not only to our students and their
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
Futures but to our economy here in New
 
02:43:02.510 --> 02:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so um so
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
anyway the
 
02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:05.870 align:start position:0%
anyway the
um

02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
how are public schools go about doing
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
their performing their jobs is uh is
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
tied closely with not only everything
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's in representative Tanner's law
 
02:43:19.849 --> 02:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
book that that we all have in in front
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
of us but also the um uh implemented
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
through rules that are adopted by the
 
02:43:29.210 --> 02:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education and uh and now
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm really in an area where it's I'm I'm
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know I've never I've never taught in
 
02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
the Public's I've never taught in a
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
school before I've been on a school
 
02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:38.270 align:start position:0%
school before I've been on a school
board

02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I've never been an administrator in a
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
school uh so I'm really sort of coming
 
02:43:46.849 --> 02:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
up to the edge of my um you know you
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
know my confidence in this area but I
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
believe a lot of these are called quote
 
02:43:54.170 --> 02:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
the Ed rules and um and these are the
 
02:43:56.690 --> 02:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
rules that that that the New Hampshire
 
02:44:01.309 --> 02:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education use for um for
 
02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
um approving uh schools as public
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
schools in in in the state and I'm sure
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
although I don't have any any direct
 
02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this but I'm sure over the
 
02:44:16.490 --> 02:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
decades and decades and decades that
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
these rules have um have been developed
 
02:44:22.730 --> 02:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
and evolved and changed over time to
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
reflect um uh maybe more you know under
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know how we go about understanding
 
02:44:30.290 --> 02:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
how students learn what they need to
 
02:44:32.090 --> 02:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
learn what's relevant to our economies
 
02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh and things like that
 
02:44:38.809 --> 02:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
um and um and currently my understanding
 
02:44:41.929 --> 02:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
is that these rules are again in
 
02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
um uh in the in the process of being
 
02:44:47.929 --> 02:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
being being redeveloped uh looking at
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
certain things that are currently
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
requirements maybe re recategorizing
 
02:44:55.250 --> 02:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
them as expectations and
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the big question is how
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
would or how will or how wood changes to
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
our our um our state's education rules
 
02:45:12.170 --> 02:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh impact um students
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
and their outcomes not just on the nape
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
and SAT scores but in their outcomes as
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
um as as as
 
02:45:25.130 --> 02:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
successful uh people uh in New Hampshire
 
02:45:28.690 --> 02:45:28.700 align:start position:0%
and and in our economy and their
 
02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
ability to uh to to to to contribute to
 
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
I think all the things that that we find
 
02:45:39.469 --> 02:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
important in in our in our um in New
 
02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country so
 
02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:44.330 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country so
um so

02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:45:47.450 --> 02:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
currently the the the changes I think
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
are being developed
 
02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
um now but uh but not necessarily in in
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
full public View and not necessarily in
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
collab in a collaborative way with um
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders uh that may include I
 
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
think experts in uh in a number of
 
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
different fields but also also members
 
02:46:11.389 --> 02:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
of the public and students
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
um who are obviously important
 
02:46:16.270 --> 02:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this um in this Mission
 
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
this committee by somebody sitting right
 
02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
where I am now was promised several
 
02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
weeks ago that we would have copies of
 
02:46:26.450 --> 02:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
um of the draft standards and uh to date
 
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have we have seen
 
02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:30.790 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have we have seen
anything

02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
but but most importantly what house bill
 
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
371 does is really get to how you go
 
02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:40.730 align:start position:0%
371 does is really get to how you go
about

02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:41.349 align:start position:0%
about
um

02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:45.469 --> 02:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
responsibly making uh making changes to
 
02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
our Ed rules consistent with
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
all of the laws and and representative
 
02:46:53.270 --> 02:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
Tanner's green law book
 
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
um that we all have uh in front of us
 
02:46:59.270 --> 02:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and doing it in a way that that
 
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of of our students our
 
02:47:04.370 --> 02:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
families and our economy
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and in a way that I that I hope
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
preserves the um or not preserved but is
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
consistent with uh with the tradition of
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh of Excellence that that we've had
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
here uh in terms of student outcomes in
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh over a long period of
 
02:47:22.490 --> 02:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
time so uh so the bill
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
um is very straightforward in um and um
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
and now I'm I'm just on page one of the
 
02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not going to go through it and
 
02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh and agonizing detail but it basically
 
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
establishes a uh a commission to
 
02:47:40.370 --> 02:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
evaluate and recommend the education
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
standards the rules used to um to
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
approve public schools and uh it
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
includes um a couple members of the
 
02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
House one member of the Senate and then
 
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
you can sort of go down and see I'm sort
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
of in the middle of page one
 
02:47:58.929 --> 02:47:58.939 align:start position:0%
um different
 
02:48:01.250 --> 02:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
experts in the field of Education
 
02:48:03.889 --> 02:48:03.899 align:start position:0%
whether they're teachers
 
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
um uh Behavioral Health practitioners
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
school counselors a nutrition director
 
02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:11.929 align:start position:0%
school counselors a nutrition director
administrators

02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
and then over on page page two special
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
education Advocate a business
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative I know the representative
 
02:48:22.969 --> 02:48:22.979 align:start position:0%
from the Bia on the school funding
 
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
commission was was very important and
 
02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
had a very important role in in that
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's got a couple of parents got a
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
couple of students and um and among the
 
02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities and how the
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
commission acts and I know this is very
 
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
important it acts as an independent
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
commission and uh and that means it's
 
02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's independent of the legislature I
 
02:48:47.210 --> 02:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
mean yeah it's got It's got three
 
02:48:50.690 --> 02:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
legislators on it but but it's got It's
 
02:48:54.410 --> 02:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
got stakeholders on it and it is not
 
02:48:58.370 --> 02:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
being driven by by any um any any
 
02:49:01.450 --> 02:49:01.460 align:start position:0%
political force it's independent of um
 
02:49:05.270 --> 02:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
of that and then among its uh its charge
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
it includes a ref recommend a minimum
 
02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
standards for uh Public School approval
 
02:49:13.070 --> 02:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's the predominant one but
 
02:49:15.050 --> 02:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
very important
 
02:49:18.650 --> 02:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
that that it also considers you know
 
02:49:20.270 --> 02:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
um you know other
 
02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
um other input and and look at other
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
things that may be relevant uh to make
 
02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
sure that uh that we've got some of the
 
02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
or that we're among you know the best
 
02:49:32.330 --> 02:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
um public schools in uh in the country
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
so um and providing our students with
 
02:49:38.690 --> 02:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
those opportunities going on to uh to
 
02:49:41.450 --> 02:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
page three at the top is a reporting
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
section uh where an initial a
 
02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
preliminary report would would be
 
02:49:49.309 --> 02:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
submitted to a number of different uh
 
02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
um uh Folks by June 1st 2024 and final
 
02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
report by November 1st 2027
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
and actually annual reports uh submitted
 
02:50:04.610 --> 02:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
every year uh between 2024 and 2027 and
 
02:50:07.250 --> 02:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
then uh finally the the entire process
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
would sunset on November 1st 2027
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
commensurate with that final report I
 
02:50:17.210 --> 02:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
notice there's a there's an error in
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
on line 17 of Section 3 where Roman one
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
should say section two of this actual
 
02:50:28.250 --> 02:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
take effect November 1st 2027 and for um
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
for uh um uh for new members to the the
 
02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
legislature the way you do the way the
 
02:50:38.210 --> 02:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
way we've we've traditionally done sun
 
02:50:40.849 --> 02:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
setting is through a repeal provision so
 
02:50:43.370 --> 02:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
that repeal provision provision is on
 
02:50:47.210 --> 02:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
line 14 section 2 which repeals the
 
02:50:50.450 --> 02:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
entire thing and uh in that part that
 
02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
section two would not take into effect
 
02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
until November 1st 2027 so that's um
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
that gives it the full you know life
 
02:51:01.969 --> 02:51:01.979 align:start position:0%
cycle of of a creation establishment of
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
a study commission the work of the study
 
02:51:06.050 --> 02:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
commission the deliverables of the study
 
02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission and then the repeal uh once
 
02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
that work is is done so I'm happy to
 
02:51:13.370 --> 02:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
take some questions I I think there's a
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's um hopefully a few people that I
 
02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
think probably have a lot more
 
02:51:20.090 --> 02:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
experience in this area that where
 
02:51:23.570 --> 02:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
anything detailed uh with respect to the
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
work that's being done right now by the
 
02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:26.770 align:start position:0%
work that's being done right now by the
department

02:51:26.770 --> 02:51:26.780 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:51:29.090 --> 02:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
could be asked but I'll take what you
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
got here thank you I'll open up with one
 
02:51:32.809 --> 02:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
question for you just to get some
 
02:51:32.819 --> 02:51:34.309 align:start position:0%
question for you just to get some
clarification

02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:51:37.270 --> 02:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
is this about the minimum Public School
 
02:51:40.490 --> 02:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
approval standards only or academic
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
standards because there's two types of
 
02:51:45.170 --> 02:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
Standards which are approved by the
 
02:51:48.469 --> 02:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
state board I don't see the academic
 
02:51:51.070 --> 02:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
standards mentioned within so it's just
 
02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
306. that's my that's that's the
 
02:51:57.230 --> 02:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
intention of um of of this of this
 
02:51:59.090 --> 02:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
02:52:01.130 --> 02:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair it's all right I have
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
two questions they're different
 
02:52:07.849 --> 02:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
um first question is we can refer to uh
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
page two line 17 where it states under
 
02:52:14.349 --> 02:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
um commission shall uh it talks about
 
02:52:16.849 --> 02:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten through grade 12. are
 
02:52:19.370 --> 02:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
we are we suggesting here through this
 
02:52:21.230 --> 02:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
that the commission is going to look to
 
02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
expand the definition of an adequate
 
02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
education from current things to include
 
02:52:26.279 --> 02:52:27.830 align:start position:0%
education from current things to include
pre-kindergarten

02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
so so thanks for the question I think uh
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
I think the commission could certainly
 
02:52:34.490 --> 02:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
be looking at that the state does have a
 
02:52:36.530 --> 02:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide uh
 
02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten for uh for certain
 
02:52:43.070 --> 02:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
groups and um and uh and I think in in
 
02:52:47.450 --> 02:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
with with with stipulation that uh that
 
02:52:49.490 --> 02:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
that no more than 50 percent of the
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
students in a Pre-K uh program
 
02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:53.210 align:start position:0%
students in a Pre-K uh program
um

02:52:53.210 --> 02:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:57.490 --> 02:52:57.500 align:start position:0%
uh can be can be not special education
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
students so so I think there may be some
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
people that can that can that can answer
 
02:53:04.250 --> 02:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
that question in Greater detail than
 
02:53:06.830 --> 02:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you and if I made it yeah the
 
02:53:08.570 --> 02:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
second question uh referring same page
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
line 32 same it's talking about the
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirements of the commissioner what
 
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
they shall do it says promote within the
 
02:53:19.010 --> 02:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
schools and the general population of
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
implementation of the minimum standards
 
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
for public school approval I'm is this
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking about like a I don't know like a
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
messaging campaign to the population of
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
the state to get them on board with this
 
02:53:31.490 --> 02:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about yeah I think
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically transparency that um
 
02:53:36.349 --> 02:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
that that people in in New Hampshire
 
02:53:39.230 --> 02:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
should be should be um I don't use this
 
02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
word a lot but I think I should be proud
 
02:53:43.370 --> 02:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
of our of our public schools and and
 
02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that we've got
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for school approval
 
02:53:51.230 --> 02:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
that don't make it easy to uh to to run
 
02:53:52.910 --> 02:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
a public school we've got school
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
administrators here with US
 
02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
Representative Woodcock uh
 
02:53:59.630 --> 02:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden and um and uh
 
02:54:01.610 --> 02:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
you know I I I remember the
 
02:54:04.250 --> 02:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
superintendent I'm sure Dr cascadden has
 
02:54:07.190 --> 02:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
said this you know uh that schools
 
02:54:09.110 --> 02:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
operate in a highly regulated
 
02:54:12.889 --> 02:54:12.899 align:start position:0%
environment and um and um I think a lot
 
02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
of that is there for Consumer Protection
 
02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that uh that that
 
02:54:21.469 --> 02:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
students are receiving the the the the
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know uh a public education that
 
02:54:28.849 --> 02:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
relevant to our economy relevant to
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
their Futures and at a level that that
 
02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
is that is going to put them you know in
 
02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
an environment where they can learn and
 
02:54:40.010 --> 02:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh and they can have strong outcomes if
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
I may just a very brief follow-up on
 
02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:42.769 align:start position:0%
I may just a very brief follow-up on
that

02:54:42.769 --> 02:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:44.570 --> 02:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
um because of course it's one thing to
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
present to have a commission that looks
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
at this stuff and present a report that
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
the general public can then look at it
 
02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
but can you speak to the the propriety
 
02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
of of doing something like a messaging
 
02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
campaign to the general public to try to
 
02:54:58.010 --> 02:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
get them on board with something
 
02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
well I think it's it's it's it's it's
 
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
probably best done in contrast to what's
 
02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
being done right now uh which is behind
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
closed doors
 
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
um uh like I said we still haven't
 
02:55:13.130 --> 02:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
received a copy of a draft report that's
 
02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to go before the State Board of
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Education for review and approval and
 
02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
who knows when but I I heard maybe even
 
02:55:24.889 --> 02:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
um uh within the next number of weeks so
 
02:55:26.809 --> 02:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
so we haven't seen anything right now
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
certainly I think work
 
02:55:33.230 --> 02:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
um that's um that that is used to uh uh
 
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
Define Public School approval and what
 
02:55:39.050 --> 02:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars of public property
 
02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer three billion dollars total of
 
02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh taxpayer money goes
 
02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
to support it should uh it should be
 
02:55:51.290 --> 02:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
done with um uh out there where people
 
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
can see it and uh people eyes wide open
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
know what's uh know what's going on
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes represent Balboni
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
um since I'm new here so I'm going to
 
02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
ask a pretty basic question I I think
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
um how are the standards currently
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
updated and who is currently involved in
 
02:56:15.230 --> 02:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much for the
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh for the question I think there's
 
02:56:21.530 --> 02:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
probably people that follow
 
02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
um that that can that can that can
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
better answer that question uh just just
 
02:56:30.170 --> 02:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh at a at a high high level
 
02:56:32.809 --> 02:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
um I believe my understanding is that
 
02:56:34.969 --> 02:56:34.979 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has
 
02:56:37.969 --> 02:56:37.979 align:start position:0%
contracted with a consultant to uh to
 
02:56:40.429 --> 02:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
manage that um you know the whole
 
02:56:43.969 --> 02:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
operation and beyond that I really don't
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
um uh know how it's being done it's
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
certainly not being done in a way that's
 
02:56:49.809 --> 02:56:49.819 align:start position:0%
uh that's been
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
transparent or um you know or
 
02:56:53.399 --> 02:56:54.830 align:start position:0%
transparent or um you know or
collaborative

02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
02:56:56.330 --> 02:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
got a question I'm looking at the
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
commission makeup
 
02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
he ran out of letters in the alphabet uh
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
when you were doing just about but
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
um of course that's pretty unwieldy 25.
 
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah would you would you believe I
 
02:57:14.030 --> 02:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually got uh got a response from some
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
of this of why why am I not on the
 
02:57:17.450 --> 02:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
haven't I've been named to the
 
02:57:19.849 --> 02:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
commission too right and it's somebody
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
that said that comes into this committee
 
02:57:23.570 --> 02:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
quite a bit you've indicated a lot of
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
different organizations
 
02:57:27.769 --> 02:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
but you've neglected to include the
 
02:57:28.969 --> 02:57:28.979 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
02:57:31.849 --> 02:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or even the university system
 
02:57:33.170 --> 02:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which are teacher
 
02:57:35.570 --> 02:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
preparation programs and you know that's
 
02:57:37.250 --> 02:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
where they come from
 
02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah no thank thanks thanks very much
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd I I I I I I
 
02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree with you that um
 
02:57:48.410 --> 02:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
that that that that
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
both the community colleges and I I
 
02:57:52.490 --> 02:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
chair of one of the Community College
 
02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:53.990 align:start position:0%
chair of one of the Community College
boards

02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:57:55.969 --> 02:57:55.979 align:start position:0%
um and I'm gonna I'm on a University of
 
02:57:58.490 --> 02:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire board as well and uh that
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
that they are absolutely stakeholders in
 
02:58:06.530 --> 02:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
this uh in this Mission and and they
 
02:58:10.370 --> 02:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
feel firsthand and as as as as we you
 
02:58:13.010 --> 02:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
know learned a couple weeks ago with the
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh with the math uh communities bill
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
um firsthand if um if schools aren't
 
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
able to um uh to to do their jobs
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh in a way that that brings students
 
02:58:28.910 --> 02:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
onto college campus where they're ready
 
02:58:32.570 --> 02:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
to learn math at a college level uh so
 
02:58:34.969 --> 02:58:34.979 align:start position:0%
um so I I absolutely agree with with
 
02:58:38.210 --> 02:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on this further questions
 
02:58:41.450 --> 02:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner thank you for
 
02:58:43.969 --> 02:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward and I also
 
02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
want to comment on the fact that the
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
commission does have a tremendous range
 
02:58:53.630 --> 02:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders uh maybe even adding the
 
02:58:55.969 --> 02:58:55.979 align:start position:0%
college and Community College system uh
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
as that could you comment on uh how
 
02:59:02.510 --> 02:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
unwielding a large commission like this
 
02:59:05.450 --> 02:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
might be or might not be
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
and what kind of results comes from a
 
02:59:09.650 --> 02:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
large commission like this based on your
 
02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:11.410 align:start position:0%
large commission like this based on your
experiences

02:59:11.410 --> 02:59:11.420 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
02:59:15.170 --> 02:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
so thanks thanks for the question
 
02:59:17.570 --> 02:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
um the the commission that concluded in
 
02:59:18.769 --> 02:59:18.779 align:start position:0%
this report
 
02:59:23.630 --> 02:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
um uh for uh for school funding uh was a
 
02:59:27.050 --> 02:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
was a one-year commission and um and we
 
02:59:28.969 --> 02:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
had 17 members
 
02:59:30.469 --> 02:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
um on that commission including
 
02:59:32.510 --> 02:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative zlad and Miler and
 
02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:34.130 align:start position:0%
representative zlad and Miler and
cascadden

02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
02:59:38.809 --> 02:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
um uh from from this room and um
 
02:59:38.819 --> 02:59:40.849 align:start position:0%
um uh from from this room and um
and

02:59:40.849 --> 02:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:44.690 --> 02:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
to be to be completely honest when we uh
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
when we when we started out uh we were
 
02:59:51.170 --> 02:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
we we met in uh in January we started
 
02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
meeting in January of 2000 and we met in
 
02:59:56.690 --> 02:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
the finance room room 210
 
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh 2 11 212. yeah down at the end
 
03:00:03.769 --> 03:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
everybody knows where it is and um and
 
03:00:06.769 --> 03:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
and you really needed that type of um
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
that type of size to what to to uh uh to
 
03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
do that we had a number of people that
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
would would attend these uh these
 
03:00:18.889 --> 03:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
commission meetings as well because of
 
03:00:20.929 --> 03:00:20.939 align:start position:0%
the obviously the Statewide importance
 
03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
of the work that that we were doing as
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
well as the work that this commission
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
would do uh during the pandemic
 
03:00:33.290 --> 03:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
um we we uh switched over to uh to uh
 
03:00:35.809 --> 03:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
Zoom for uh for the balance of the
 
03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
meetings from uh I think end of March
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
right through when the the Committees
 
03:00:45.410 --> 03:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
work was is done in on December 1st 2000
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
and and from a management standpoint I
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
chaired that committee it was I I felt
 
03:00:53.929 --> 03:00:53.939 align:start position:0%
it was easier to do to to conduct
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
business uh via Zoom but probably
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
because I also got used to that uh as
 
03:01:01.010 --> 03:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
well and zoom gives uh gives you some
 
03:01:03.410 --> 03:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know meeting management tools that
 
03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:06.899 align:start position:0%
that helps it to move along it also uh
 
03:01:09.290 --> 03:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
allowed I think a tremendous
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
participation uh from from various
 
03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
stakeholders across the state whether
 
03:01:16.490 --> 03:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
they're superintendents building
 
03:01:20.230 --> 03:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
administrators teachers parents
 
03:01:22.849 --> 03:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
members of different school boards
 
03:01:24.769 --> 03:01:24.779 align:start position:0%
advisory councils and things like that
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to watch the meeting and also
 
03:01:30.830 --> 03:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
contribute through public comment and um
 
03:01:33.250 --> 03:01:33.260 align:start position:0%
and while while none of that management
 
03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh detail is specified in the in the
 
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think there's there's
 
03:01:41.630 --> 03:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
anything that would necessarily prevent
 
03:01:45.050 --> 03:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
a committee or commission from from
 
03:01:48.590 --> 03:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
meeting in a in a hybrid mode much like
 
03:01:50.570 --> 03:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
what what we're what we're doing in
 
03:01:53.090 --> 03:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
these in these meetings so that at least
 
03:01:56.269 --> 03:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
from a from a transparency standpoint uh
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
the public would be able to uh to see
 
03:02:00.290 --> 03:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
government in action
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative thank
 
03:02:05.450 --> 03:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'd just like to make one
 
03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
comment on the independent nature of the
 
03:02:10.610 --> 03:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
commission for the committee's sake
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
since we have new people here there is
 
03:02:15.170 --> 03:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh the other option is to have a
 
03:02:16.849 --> 03:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
legislative committee
 
03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the legislative committee would
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
would only involve at the table
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislators and the problem with that I
 
03:02:27.230 --> 03:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
believe especially in something like
 
03:02:30.650 --> 03:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
this is that the only way you get voices
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
from other groups is through testimony
 
03:02:37.550 --> 03:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
by having an independent Commission
 
03:02:41.330 --> 03:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
you include those voices at the table
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
and that is a major change in how you
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
would conduct the business here and I
 
03:02:48.650 --> 03:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
think when a reference that
 
03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative luno talked about the
 
03:02:53.389 --> 03:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
school funding commission that was the
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
intent of that was we wanted to get
 
03:02:57.769 --> 03:02:57.779 align:start position:0%
those voices that are directly involved
 
03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
in this at the table and not just giving
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
a testimony then walking away that
 
03:03:05.929 --> 03:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
they're engaged in it so I I would
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
commend your independent nature on this
 
03:03:10.730 --> 03:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
because I think this is important as you
 
03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
begin to look at standards
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
um there's no question here but that as
 
03:03:17.929 --> 03:03:17.939 align:start position:0%
you begin to look at standards having
 
03:03:21.230 --> 03:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
voices at the table that are involved in
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
implementing those standards I think
 
03:03:25.610 --> 03:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's very important and thank you for
 
03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward thank you
 
03:03:28.490 --> 03:03:28.500 align:start position:0%

want to be sure uh
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
is this your intent that these
 
03:03:40.849 --> 03:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
commission meetings will be open to the
 
03:03:44.690 --> 03:03:44.700 align:start position:0%

parent to two Elementary school-aged
 
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
children who attend our local public
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
school I am here as a strong supporter
 
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
of quality education and as a parent and
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
I am asking that you vote HB 371 as
 
03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
the 306 rules which representative Muno
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned touch on every aspect of a
 
03:04:48.050 --> 03:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
student's Public School experience from
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
the lunch that they will eat in the
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
school cafeteria to the professional
 
03:04:54.410 --> 03:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
development their Educators receive and
 
03:04:56.690 --> 03:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
literally everything in between
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
currently our department of education is
 
03:05:00.830 --> 03:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
undergoing the process of revisiting
 
03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
03:05:06.050 --> 03:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
um in a way that has been opaque and
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
exclusive of public oversight and
 
03:05:10.250 --> 03:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
participation meetings and minutes are
 
03:05:12.650 --> 03:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
not easily accessible the draft of the
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
rules and process are shared only with a
 
03:05:16.250 --> 03:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
narrow group of people and are
 
03:05:19.010 --> 03:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to parents and students
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
our organization is one of many that
 
03:05:23.150 --> 03:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
signed a letter which was presented to
 
03:05:25.849 --> 03:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Ed asking for a halt
 
03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
or revision of the 306 process
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
HB 371 would correct the errors of the
 
03:05:35.090 --> 03:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
process currently underway the suggested
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
participants as listed in the bill which
 
03:05:39.050 --> 03:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
we were talking about it's a large group
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
of people but it is inclusive and it is
 
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
mindful in particular the inclusion of
 
03:05:47.809 --> 03:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
parents and students as a parent of two
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
Elementary school-aged kiddos
 
03:05:53.450 --> 03:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
I've been dismayed in the lack of
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
availability of the process and the
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
ability for my voice to be a part of
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
this critical decision-making process
 
03:06:03.530 --> 03:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
this bill would certainly give myself
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
and other parents across the state the
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
assurance that our concerns and more
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
importantly the experiences are are
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me experiences of our students
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
are being taken seriously it also allows
 
03:06:16.370 --> 03:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
for a timeline that would enable enable
 
03:06:19.130 --> 03:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
public participation in an observation
 
03:06:20.950 --> 03:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
HB 371 affords us an opportunity to do
 
03:06:26.510 --> 03:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
right by our public school system in a
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
way that has been lacking over the past
 
03:06:30.769 --> 03:06:30.779 align:start position:0%
several years strong public education
 
03:06:32.990 --> 03:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
requires a strong Foundation which is
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
what these rules can provide please show
 
03:06:37.370 --> 03:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families that you care
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
about quality education and strong
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
public schools by voting OTP on HP 371.
 
03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah are the questions from
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
03:06:51.950 --> 03:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:06:54.530 --> 03:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
my question and for your work could you
 
03:06:57.490 --> 03:06:57.500 align:start position:0%
just detail a little bit about
 
03:07:01.210 --> 03:07:01.220 align:start position:0%
your organization and others efforts to
 
03:07:03.889 --> 03:07:03.899 align:start position:0%
follow the current process and what the
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
barriers have been yeah of course so I
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of being able to
 
03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
attend State Board of Education meetings
 
03:07:12.410 --> 03:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
and to watch the rules process as it
 
03:07:15.769 --> 03:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
develops many rules processes like for
 
03:07:17.929 --> 03:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education were
 
03:07:20.090 --> 03:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
really well done very publicly open
 
03:07:21.889 --> 03:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
everybody had access to understand the
 
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
way the process was going and to watch
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
the development of those rules which
 
03:07:28.490 --> 03:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
were very successful this however the
 
03:07:31.250 --> 03:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
306 rules has deviated from that
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
standard in a way that I don't know what
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
the Draft rules look like I as a parent
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
or just a layperson being able to access
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
this process via the Doe's website is
 
03:07:46.010 --> 03:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
very cumbersome it is not up front it
 
03:07:47.769 --> 03:07:47.779 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of digging
 
03:07:51.230 --> 03:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
and parents and students from what I am
 
03:07:53.330 --> 03:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
aware of or not at the table for this
 
03:07:55.849 --> 03:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
conversation and I think that's a very
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
critical voice that's not being included
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that there are plans
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
for that to happen outside of the Normal
 
03:08:04.370 --> 03:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
public hearing process through the State
 
03:08:06.530 --> 03:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed I'd like to see those voices
 
03:08:09.769 --> 03:08:09.779 align:start position:0%
Incorporated before we get to the final
 
03:08:12.590 --> 03:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
stages of these really critical rules
 
03:08:15.290 --> 03:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
that dictate how public education
 
03:08:17.690 --> 03:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
functions in our state
 
03:08:19.849 --> 03:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:08:19.859 --> 03:08:21.349 align:start position:0%
further questions
yep

03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
could you also please share with us what
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know about the presence of Educators
 
03:08:32.450 --> 03:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
at different levels on that existing uh
 
03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:33.530 align:start position:0%
at different levels on that existing uh
effort

03:08:33.530 --> 03:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
effort
 
03:08:36.410 --> 03:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
so I do know that the doe has had
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
conversations with Educators I believe
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
there's been one or two meetings again
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's not a very transparent process so
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't have the full scope of what
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
those conversations look like I don't
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
know what educators are at that table I
 
03:08:55.370 --> 03:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
trust that folks involved in the process
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
do have the best intentions for our
 
03:09:00.170 --> 03:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
students but without the public being
 
03:09:02.330 --> 03:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
able to fully know and easily access
 
03:09:04.730 --> 03:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
that information we don't know what we
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
don't know I hope that answers your
 
03:09:09.170 --> 03:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
question experience thank you for the
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
very much okay thank you very much for
 
03:09:14.929 --> 03:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and we'd like to invite
 
03:09:31.269 --> 03:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.370 --> 03:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is David
 
03:09:37.969 --> 03:09:37.979 align:start position:0%
Trumbull I'm from the town aware
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
representing myself I support this bill
 
03:09:42.349 --> 03:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that were already stated
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
but I'll go into a little bit of detail
 
03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
I just want to be honest I am not able
 
03:09:49.130 --> 03:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
to access all the information but what
 
03:09:51.650 --> 03:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
I've been able to have learned I will
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
use I support this bill for three
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
reasons first it's open and transparent
 
03:09:58.610 --> 03:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
government just like this committee here
 
03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
you have hearings people citizens
 
03:10:04.429 --> 03:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
Educators parents come in when you
 
03:10:06.410 --> 03:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
deliberate we can watch it online from
 
03:10:08.570 --> 03:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
home there's a public record there's
 
03:10:11.330 --> 03:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the current DOA plan
 
03:10:13.309 --> 03:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
there is none of this there's no public
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
minutes there's no public meetings
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's no back and forth if you look at
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
your local school boards those are
 
03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
elected officials parents Educators
 
03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
people who work in the schools go in and
 
03:10:26.570 --> 03:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
testify or speak at their public school
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
board meetings it goes from the school
 
03:10:30.170 --> 03:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
board the superintendent in the back and
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's back and forth it's open the
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
commission that representative luno
 
03:10:35.450 --> 03:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
described with school funding same thing
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
on Zoom well attended that's good
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
government when you have a chance to
 
03:10:42.230 --> 03:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
hear from people the citizens have a
 
03:10:44.450 --> 03:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
right to participate and the parents
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
rights are respected there's been a lot
 
03:10:48.349 --> 03:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
of discussion about parents rights and
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
education in this session from both
 
03:10:52.730 --> 03:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
sides and if you believe in parents
 
03:10:54.290 --> 03:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
rights you would want to have education
 
03:10:56.510 --> 03:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
rules that are being debated in public
 
03:10:58.490 --> 03:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
so that everybody knows what's going on
 
03:11:00.230 --> 03:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's no way that you can say I'm for
 
03:11:02.090 --> 03:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
parents rights on education Freedom
 
03:11:03.650 --> 03:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
accounts but you don't care about the
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
rules being drafted their parents not
 
03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
having an input so I think basically
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
what's happening is doe is trying to
 
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
legislate in secret and that's not good
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
governments even if you like the results
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
of what they come up with you wouldn't
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
want that to be the process by which our
 
03:11:20.450 --> 03:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
system runs second reason I like this
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill is it's it's not really that the
 
03:11:24.710 --> 03:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
main issue but it does mention the term
 
03:11:27.050 --> 03:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
adequacy if you look at the the
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
commission shall number Roman numeral 3B
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
determine whether the current minimum
 
03:11:34.250 --> 03:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
standards provide the opportunity for
 
03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education for all
 
03:11:39.650 --> 03:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
students pre-k through 12. we need data
 
03:11:42.170 --> 03:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
on adequacy WE debate whether or not the
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
property poor towns are able to
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
adequately educate their children
 
03:11:48.769 --> 03:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
this bill will have this commission look
 
03:11:50.630 --> 03:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
at that and get you some data so when
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
those bills come up in the next
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and the one after that
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to look at it and say
 
03:11:56.690 --> 03:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
Here's the educational results
 
03:11:58.910 --> 03:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state you can line up the
 
03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
towns from property poor to property
 
03:12:03.170 --> 03:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
Rich towns and compare the results and
 
03:12:05.090 --> 03:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
you'll see that correlation that
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative linole talked about but
 
03:12:08.929 --> 03:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
you'll have the hard data to then be
 
03:12:11.389 --> 03:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
able to make good decisions about how to
 
03:12:13.490 --> 03:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
implement the Claremont decision and I
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
would also ask you to look at I I was
 
03:12:19.070 --> 03:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
able to look at A draft copy online of
 
03:12:23.530 --> 03:12:23.540 align:start position:0%
this bill of the doe regs but in three
 
03:12:27.230 --> 03:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
30606 B1 what they do is eliminate
 
03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
looking at Equity gaps in achievement
 
03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
and instead look at the quote
 
03:12:32.929 --> 03:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
underperformance of individual students
 
03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
so in other words the idea that Equity
 
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
that the problem is that there's a
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
equity gap between Property Port Towns
 
03:12:41.210 --> 03:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
and property Rich towns that's going to
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
be like eliminated from our nomenclature
 
03:12:45.230 --> 03:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
and now it's individual students are
 
03:12:46.969 --> 03:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
underperforming so it's their fault that
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
they're not doing well in a town that
 
03:12:49.969 --> 03:12:49.979 align:start position:0%
can't provide them their resources so
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
just the philosophical difference
 
03:12:53.690 --> 03:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
between what representative luno's Bill
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
proposes which is to say let's look at
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
the data as opposed to we're eliminating
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
the concept of equity from the question
 
03:13:02.330 --> 03:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
completely I think this would be a good
 
03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
reason why you would want to have this
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill so you can get the data to make
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
good decisions as you do your work over
 
03:13:08.279 --> 03:13:09.469 align:start position:0%
good decisions as you do your work over
time

03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
the third reason I support the bill is
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
that it protects the civil and
 
03:13:15.469 --> 03:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
educational rights of the students that
 
03:13:15.479 --> 03:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
educational rights of the students that
the

03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:13:20.570 --> 03:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
copy that I looked at of this new 306
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
has several areas of concern to me one
 
03:13:27.530 --> 03:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
is in 30604 J it adds personal learning
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
plans for every student but there's no
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
explanation of how that interacts with
 
03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
IEPs and 504 plants does it replace them
 
03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
with this personal learning plan and
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
what exactly are the rules governing
 
03:13:42.130 --> 03:13:42.140 align:start position:0%
that it also takes out in
 
03:13:45.050 --> 03:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
30604j the duty to look at the
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
instructional needs of each student
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
based on a number of things including
 
03:13:49.969 --> 03:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
their development so it looks like it
 
03:13:51.889 --> 03:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
weakens the rights for special ed
 
03:13:53.690 --> 03:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
students but there's nothing clearly
 
03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
stating it there clearly we need to know
 
03:13:58.969 --> 03:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
what they're doing at DOD this bill by
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
comparison says that we want to promote
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
a inclusive learning environment at all
 
03:14:05.809 --> 03:14:05.819 align:start position:0%
public schools around the state so
 
03:14:07.550 --> 03:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
clearly this bill says special ed
 
03:14:11.210 --> 03:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
students we're keeping you covered the
 
03:14:13.370 --> 03:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
current doe regulations it's not clear
 
03:14:17.290 --> 03:14:17.300 align:start position:0%
the second thing is competencies in 3060
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
4b25 it takes out a dozen competencies
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
no longer it just completely removes the
 
03:14:24.290 --> 03:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
whole section competencies on Arts
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
digital literacy English math physical
 
03:14:29.090 --> 03:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
science biological science New Hampshire
 
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
and U.S history New Hampshire and U.S
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
government Civics economics personal
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
finance world history geography health
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
and physical education all those things
 
03:14:41.230 --> 03:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
are removed in the new 306.
 
03:14:44.090 --> 03:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
is this a backdoor approach to basically
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
hollowing out the public schools that
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
parents can get together with their
 
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
children put together a bundled plan to
 
03:14:51.050 --> 03:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
go do what they want to do but at the
 
03:14:52.370 --> 03:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
end of the day they don't know English
 
03:14:55.090 --> 03:14:55.100 align:start position:0%
and math and history that's ridiculous
 
03:14:58.429 --> 03:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
we should have competency standards that
 
03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
make sense like Professor uh
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative luno testified we have a
 
03:15:04.250 --> 03:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
great school system in the state why
 
03:15:05.450 --> 03:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
would you want to tear down something
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's working and eliminate
 
03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
competencies in all of these basic areas
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
so children by the time they're in
 
03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
seventh grade could just leave the
 
03:15:13.730 --> 03:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
public school go do what they want to do
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
and nobody cares if they know anything
 
03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
about history or math or geography that
 
03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense so this bill
 
03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
would make sure that doesn't happen a
 
03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
third area I'm concerned about is lgbtq
 
03:15:27.410 --> 03:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
students this this bill talks about an
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
inclusive learning environment however
 
03:15:33.889 --> 03:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
in the proposed draft 30606 A4 it takes
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
out protected classes for race ethnicity
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
and gender and replaces it with a
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
language saying any and all stereotypes
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
and biases now now you could say well
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
any and all would include everything but
 
03:15:45.410 --> 03:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
we all know that a general phrasing of
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
any and all isn't worth much if you're
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
in a protected class you want to have
 
03:15:51.230 --> 03:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
your class specifically mentioned I mean
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
just consider that we had to pass the
 
03:15:54.769 --> 03:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act to make sure black
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
people could vote in this country women
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
were denied the right to vote lgbtqp
 
03:16:01.370 --> 03:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
will need its same-sex marriage you need
 
03:16:03.469 --> 03:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
to have specific legislation or else
 
03:16:05.210 --> 03:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
people who are in these protected
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
classes lose their rights the proposed
 
03:16:09.050 --> 03:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
regulations weaken that we don't know
 
03:16:10.610 --> 03:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
what the impact would be but it could be
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
very detrimental and it's worth pointing
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
out that as of today according to the
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
CDC 22 percent of high school students
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
identify as lgbtq so you're talking
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
about one in every five students who may
 
03:16:25.130 --> 03:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
lose rights under the new doe rules the
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
last issues is the discipline policy the
 
03:16:32.110 --> 03:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
regs in 30606 B2 completely removes
 
03:16:34.610 --> 03:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
the system that says we will establish
 
03:16:36.230 --> 03:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
right now this is the status quo we
 
03:16:38.570 --> 03:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
establish a fair and Equitable code of
 
03:16:40.969 --> 03:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
discipline that is fairly inconsistently
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
implemented so they're getting rid of
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
the code of discipline that is fair and
 
03:16:47.210 --> 03:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
Equitable fairly and consistently
 
03:16:49.610 --> 03:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
implemented so what difference does that
 
03:16:51.650 --> 03:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
make if you're a student of color or if
 
03:16:53.570 --> 03:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
you're a student with a disability you
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
are disciplined much more dramatically
 
03:16:57.290 --> 03:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
than people who are not so I'll just
 
03:16:59.330 --> 03:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
give you a few statistics to finish up
 
03:17:01.309 --> 03:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
here in the car seat School of public
 
03:17:03.410 --> 03:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
policy at UNH did a report called the
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
exclusionary discipline highest in New
 
03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Urban schools what they say is
 
03:17:11.809 --> 03:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
that exclusive exclusionary discipline
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
affects 11 to 12 percent of students
 
03:17:15.769 --> 03:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
between grades eight to twelve so this
 
03:17:17.570 --> 03:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
is a lot of students over 10 percent of
 
03:17:19.250 --> 03:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
our students either get in-school
 
03:17:21.410 --> 03:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
suspension or out of school suspension
 
03:17:23.809 --> 03:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
but who does it affect they looked at
 
03:17:26.990 --> 03:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
the length of exclusion for students of
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
color it's over two times greater for in
 
03:17:32.090 --> 03:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
school and 2.7 times greater for out of
 
03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
school they looked at students with
 
03:17:35.929 --> 03:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
disabilities for non-disabilities with
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
no disabilities the rate is from one to
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
five percent for those with disabilities
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's from 11 to 51 in other words
 
03:17:44.330 --> 03:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and students
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
of color get disciplined more often and
 
03:17:47.520 --> 03:17:48.309 align:start position:0%
of color get disciplined more often and
it's

03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:17:50.929 --> 03:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
doctor monitor did a report from the
 
03:17:52.910 --> 03:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
reported on our study from the Juvenile
 
03:17:55.250 --> 03:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
Justice Reform project that set students
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
of color in New Hampshire twice as
 
03:18:00.290 --> 03:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
likely to be disciplined students of
 
03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
color with disabilities over five times
 
03:18:04.250 --> 03:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
as likely to be disciplined in their
 
03:18:06.230 --> 03:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
study after study going on and saying
 
03:18:08.210 --> 03:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
the same thing for basically the same
 
03:18:10.010 --> 03:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
behaviors and usually it's just for
 
03:18:11.330 --> 03:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
minor infractions the American
 
03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association did a report
 
03:18:15.530 --> 03:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
called for black students unfairly harsh
 
03:18:17.809 --> 03:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
discipline can lead to lower grades 26
 
03:18:19.250 --> 03:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
percent of black students compared to
 
03:18:21.290 --> 03:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
only two percent of white students were
 
03:18:23.809 --> 03:18:23.819 align:start position:0%
suspended for minor infractions that's
 
03:18:25.490 --> 03:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
like dress code and using your cell
 
03:18:27.230 --> 03:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
phone in class so the result is it
 
03:18:30.170 --> 03:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
impacts people dramatically so if they
 
03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
eliminate this entire Clause from the
 
03:18:34.969 --> 03:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
306 rules there's nothing in place the
 
03:18:36.410 --> 03:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
rules that says we have to have a fair
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
and impartial discipline policy but
 
03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
these are all things that would come out
 
03:18:43.130 --> 03:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
if they had an open discussion if they
 
03:18:44.929 --> 03:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
let the public participate if they head
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
back and forth with people if they
 
03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
invited people in rather than excluding
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
people from making the rules they're
 
03:18:51.889 --> 03:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
trying to legislate from a little room
 
03:18:53.690 --> 03:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
with a small group of people what you're
 
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
doing here every single day is the right
 
03:18:57.050 --> 03:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
way to do it and that's why I support
 
03:18:58.490 --> 03:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Mr
 
03:19:02.510 --> 03:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
Trumbull are there any questions from
 
03:19:05.570 --> 03:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
the committee represent Belcher thank
 
03:19:06.530 --> 03:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for your
 
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I just wanted to clarify the
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
the draft uh rules those are on the
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
State website I uh found them through a
 
03:19:16.610 --> 03:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
non-profit education organization that
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
had a link to them and I looked at them
 
03:19:22.130 --> 03:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
this morning so I I don't know uh why
 
03:19:24.050 --> 03:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
you don't have them and I was able to
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
look at them today but
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
so you don't know if they're on the
 
03:19:31.370 --> 03:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
State website it was not uh I'm sorry I
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't have my laptop with me and I I'm
 
03:19:35.510 --> 03:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
just not from but I mean it was I would
 
03:19:37.730 --> 03:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
have printed it but it was so long it
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
would have been 100 pages and I really
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to do that this morning
 
03:19:43.429 --> 03:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
but it's clearly 306 and it's you know
 
03:19:44.929 --> 03:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
etched out in red and crossed out and
 
03:19:46.250 --> 03:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
replaced with this so it's it's it's
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's the real thing I don't know where I
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't I have that data for you but I
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
think you should have access to that if
 
03:19:53.990 --> 03:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
I can look at it everybody here should
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
have access to that sure thank you yeah
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%

pretorius I am the policy director with
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
reaching higher New Hampshire
 
03:21:23.090 --> 03:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
and to answer that that previous
 
03:21:23.100 --> 03:21:24.290 align:start position:0%
and to answer that that previous
question

03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
um that draft is available on the
 
03:21:27.410 --> 03:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
reaching higher website
 
03:21:29.450 --> 03:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
um it is a draft that was made available
 
03:21:31.969 --> 03:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
on January 13th of this year
 
03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
I I think I I heard the question it it's
 
03:21:37.849 --> 03:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
not on the doe website uh to my
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.190 --> 03:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
oh yeah uh I think uh by May uh
 
03:22:04.610 --> 03:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for this
 
03:22:04.620 --> 03:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for this
committee

03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
to have a chance to have whoever is
 
03:22:11.330 --> 03:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
drafting these 306 rules which are
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
critical to education
 
03:22:15.290 --> 03:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
to come before this committee and have a
 
03:22:17.389 --> 03:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
chance to hear what in fact what's going
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
on I mean Mr Trimble has probably he has
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
given us more information about these
 
03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
306 rules than we've ever heard before
 
03:22:27.290 --> 03:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
and it's foundational to the future of
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
Education I mean is that something I I
 
03:22:33.230 --> 03:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
realize we've got a very full agenda
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
here but on the other hand this is
 
03:22:37.849 --> 03:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
critical to what's we've had Department
 
03:22:40.010 --> 03:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
of Education here and they've indicated
 
03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they would be provided to us within
 
03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
a period of time
 
03:22:47.650 --> 03:22:47.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that's what we're waiting for
 
03:22:50.929 --> 03:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
if in fact they they do not arrive here
 
03:22:53.809 --> 03:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
within you know a certain time that's
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know not too far out from here
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
because we're supposed to have them
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
right now if not then we can contact
 
03:23:01.969 --> 03:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
them and have them come and present that
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
what they're going to present to the
 
03:23:04.969 --> 03:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education to this
 
03:23:06.530 --> 03:23:06.540 align:start position:0%

04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
do I need the microphone on yeah okay
 
04:29:42.649 --> 04:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
um so you know we did seek to broaden it
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
based on feedback from superintendents
 
04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
um this past uh year we had a number of
 
04:29:52.130 --> 04:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
instances where superintendents applied
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
for example for uh an a one-year
 
04:29:58.849 --> 04:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
certificate for a school librarian or a
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
digital learning specialist and they
 
04:30:02.929 --> 04:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
they're not eligible under the way that
 
04:30:04.969 --> 04:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
the current statute was is written and
 
04:30:07.570 --> 04:30:07.580 align:start position:0%
the proposal initially
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
yes yeah logical I think
 
04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
I could also mention chair I forward you
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
an email this morning from
 
04:30:18.010 --> 04:30:18.020 align:start position:0%
superintendent Ron Hasbrouck in Groveton
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and that was a result of my meeting
 
04:30:24.410 --> 04:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
with the North Country superintendents
 
04:30:27.889 --> 04:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
on Thursday uh morning I was up uh in
 
04:30:29.929 --> 04:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
Whitefield at their meeting and they
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
were very excited about this bill
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
um same thing the day before I was at
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region superintendent's
 
04:30:37.610 --> 04:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
meeting there was also some excitement
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
in that room as well with this bill I
 
04:30:40.199 --> 04:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
in that room as well with this bill I
asked

04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
asked
 
04:30:43.969 --> 04:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
both groups if you have comments please
 
04:30:45.649 --> 04:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
email me and I'll forward them to the
 
04:30:45.659 --> 04:30:46.610 align:start position:0%
email me and I'll forward them to the
chair

04:30:46.610 --> 04:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
um so far I've received that one it's
 
04:30:48.479 --> 04:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
um so far I've received that one it's
okay

04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.110 --> 04:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
thanks 12 to 14 I don't think that's
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere a change
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
um on the amendment
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
a B and C are also just as they were in
 
04:31:03.120 --> 04:31:04.309 align:start position:0%
a B and C are also just as they were in
law

04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
and then we have 1A is same as it was
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
two Roman two
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
Roman 3
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
is I think that's the same as it was
 
04:31:20.760 --> 04:31:22.370 align:start position:0%
is I think that's the same as it was
introduced

04:31:22.370 --> 04:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
and line Roman 4 23
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
changing the educator again teacher
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
educator license to teacher you know
 
04:31:38.330 --> 04:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
and so those are the changes
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
that we have do you have any other
 
04:31:41.809 --> 04:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
changes this for this Steve
 
04:31:44.689 --> 04:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
you know I I think this this
 
04:31:46.849 --> 04:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
that change from teacher to educator I
 
04:31:48.649 --> 04:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
think will again assist the field a
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
great deal
 
04:31:50.760 --> 04:31:53.389 align:start position:0%
great deal
okay

04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:56.570 --> 04:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
so let's have a little discussion on the
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
mentoring of
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
no it's not but we had that discussion
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
before and so I I thought I heard people
 
04:32:05.929 --> 04:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
saying you know is there a need for
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
to have a mentor sometimes it costs
 
04:32:09.649 --> 04:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
money to have a mentor
 
04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
um uh maybe it's just that person next
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
door and they work collaboratively
 
04:32:17.149 --> 04:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
together and it's just you know part of
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
the job
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:32:31.010 --> 04:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
need to further amend this thing
 
04:32:33.410 --> 04:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
are we ready to move on
 
04:32:33.420 --> 04:32:35.090 align:start position:0%
are we ready to move on
okay

04:32:35.090 --> 04:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:38.090 --> 04:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
just one question yeah yeah rather than
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
a benefit
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
rather than just talking about Mentor in
 
04:32:45.050 --> 04:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
a general sense I'm wondering some of
 
04:32:47.689 --> 04:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
the programs that I'm familiar with we
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
have people who've been Paris for six or
 
04:32:52.250 --> 04:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
eight years and they decide they want to
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
move to a teacher's thing and they have
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bachelor's degree and so then that
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes when the school is in need of
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
someone they turn to this provision and
 
04:33:02.279 --> 04:33:03.649 align:start position:0%
someone they turn to this provision and
say

04:33:03.649 --> 04:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:33:05.810 --> 04:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
you know we'd like you to teach for a
 
04:33:08.150 --> 04:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
year or something like that and and in
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
those instances we recommend they don't
 
04:33:12.529 --> 04:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
use this law for those Powers so when
 
04:33:14.929 --> 04:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
districts contact us about that that
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
type of scenario we recommend they don't
 
04:33:20.209 --> 04:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
use this law that instead they put that
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
person on our site-based licensing path
 
04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
which provides the mentorship and a
 
04:33:26.449 --> 04:33:26.459 align:start position:0%
development plan and gives them three
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
years to gain their teacher license
 
04:33:31.250 --> 04:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
um because those folks have experience
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
and they already hold a power start so
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm glad to hear that and I'm
 
04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
familiar with at least one individual
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
who had a bachelor's degree in teaching
 
04:33:44.400 --> 04:33:45.289 align:start position:0%
who had a bachelor's degree in teaching
English

04:33:45.289 --> 04:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
English
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
as a foreign language from a university
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
in Hong Kong and the school is unclear
 
04:33:53.810 --> 04:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not they could use a
 
04:33:56.929 --> 04:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
degree from Hong Kong and they weren't
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
as tightly conversant with the
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
organization that certifies foreign
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
degrees out of Boston and so sometimes
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
it takes a little bit more to the
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
equation to make it all add up yeah
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you we we do have information in
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
our knowledge base on our website that
 
04:34:15.650 --> 04:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
directs individuals of foreign
 
04:34:17.449 --> 04:34:17.459 align:start position:0%
transcripts to contact us so we can
 
04:34:18.730 --> 04:34:18.740 align:start position:0%
connect them with the Boston
 
04:34:21.529 --> 04:34:21.539 align:start position:0%
organization that you mentioned okay so
 
04:34:22.970 --> 04:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if there's a district if
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
you think of the district and I can be
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
of help happy to to reach out okay thank
 
04:34:27.959 --> 04:34:30.650 align:start position:0%
of help happy to to reach out okay thank
you

04:34:30.650 --> 04:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
okay is there further need to discuss
 
04:34:35.689 --> 04:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
this bill no okay let's let's because we
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
have some others which are going to be I

04:34:44.570 --> 04:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
any order you want let's do this 623
 
04:34:49.131 --> 04:34:49.141 align:start position:0%
since speed was involved yes okay good
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
623 established a teacher candidate loan
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%

04:37:54.650 --> 04:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.660 --> 04:38:15.410 align:start position:0%
 
problems

04:38:15.410 --> 04:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.650 --> 04:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
yes there's a note to everybody here
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
um we we did discuss when we're going to
 
04:38:24.609 --> 04:38:24.619 align:start position:0%
be taking up 529
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
and do the fact we have the governor
 
04:38:29.689 --> 04:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
presenting tomorrow and it's our
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
understanding there may be discussion
 
04:38:34.189 --> 04:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
within that presentation of school
 
04:38:34.199 --> 04:38:35.869 align:start position:0%
within that presentation of school
funding

04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:38:38.209 --> 04:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
um so rather than executing this on the
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
15th the day after the governor That's
 
04:38:42.289 --> 04:38:42.299 align:start position:0%
History we're going to wait and do it on
 
04:38:44.570 --> 04:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
the 16th first thing in the morning
 
04:38:47.090 --> 04:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's already been put in the docket
 
04:38:49.551 --> 04:38:49.561 align:start position:0%
where we can do that where bills were
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
executing on the 16th it states
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
basically continued executive executive
 
04:38:57.529 --> 04:38:57.539 align:start position:0%
session on any remaining bills from
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
February the 15th so it's scheduled for
 
04:39:01.970 --> 04:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
the 15th we just won't deal with it in
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
the 15th we'll wait and do it on the
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
16th can we do it
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
after the uh the hearings on the 16th so
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we do have any language we need to
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
work on we can
 
04:39:14.760 --> 04:39:16.250 align:start position:0%
work on we can
um

04:39:16.250 --> 04:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:16.260 --> 04:39:18.189 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
rather than first thinking
 
04:39:22.849 --> 04:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
yeah we're gonna have to make sure
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
though that
 
04:39:27.170 --> 04:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to hustle through those
 
04:39:29.330 --> 04:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
those hearings
 
04:39:29.340 --> 04:39:33.189 align:start position:0%
those hearings
um

04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
because we're gonna we'll take our first
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.600 --> 04:39:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:51.250 --> 04:39:51.260 align:start position:0%
on the 20th
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
we won't
 
04:39:57.050 --> 04:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:57.060 --> 04:39:58.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:01.970 --> 04:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's the week before the spring break
 
04:40:03.410 --> 04:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to be a pretty busy
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
week I would say
 
04:40:10.368 --> 04:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
uh what I got to do is as soon as uh I
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
get a hold of Lindsay when she comes in
 
04:40:14.570 --> 04:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and next day I want to find out
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
how many bills we've already heard how
 
04:40:19.250 --> 04:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
many of we already exact what do we have
 
04:40:19.260 --> 04:40:20.868 align:start position:0%
many of we already exact what do we have
left

04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
if we have a large number still to here
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
and some of the ones we have to hear are
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
bills which are going to
 
04:40:28.320 --> 04:43:09.650 align:start position:0%
bills which are going to
draw

04:43:09.650 --> 04:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.890 --> 04:43:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
you know when you walk us through
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
represent myler's 623 Amendment yeah the
 
04:43:19.560 --> 04:43:20.650 align:start position:0%
represent myler's 623 Amendment yeah the
amendment

04:43:20.650 --> 04:43:20.660 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:43:24.050 --> 04:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me the amendment replaces the
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
and it changes it significantly from a
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint of uh how the loan
 
04:43:34.128 --> 04:43:34.138 align:start position:0%
reimbursement would take place we've had
 
04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
some conversation here in the committee
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
about the concern about
 
04:43:42.170 --> 04:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
the Forgiveness of loans in general
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
but I think what this is trying to do is
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
to say okay if you're going to go work
 
04:43:52.490 --> 04:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
in a rural District or in an area where
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
there is at-risk not at risk
 
04:43:58.970 --> 04:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
under-resourced needs like math science
 
04:44:01.788 --> 04:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
and and Steve this is what I need to be
 
04:44:04.010 --> 04:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
here my understanding is that the
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
department does talk about under
 
04:44:10.368 --> 04:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
improving uh underperforming schools as
 
04:44:15.850 --> 04:44:15.860 align:start position:0%
well as those uh High need
 
04:44:19.970 --> 04:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
teacher areas math science
 
04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
Etc CTE Etc and so it's to try to
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for schools out
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
of our our out of our teacher shortage
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
work group for schools to say okay look
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you come teach here if you want to
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
come to teach here in Littleton here's
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
what we can do for you we can provide we
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
can apply and get part of your tuition
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and again you note that the
 
04:44:45.840 --> 04:44:47.288 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and again you note that the
reimbursement

04:44:47.288 --> 04:44:47.298 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
accelerates based upon the number of
 
04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
years you're in the district so it
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
starts out at fifteen hundred then
 
04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred thirty five hundred
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
forty total of twelve thousand dollars
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
that they say and that my theory here
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
may be wrong but if we can get people
 
04:45:05.628 --> 04:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
stay in a district
 
04:45:07.690 --> 04:45:07.700 align:start position:0%
when they finish that fourth year
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're going to stay in that
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
District because they will have
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
commitments they may have you know maybe
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
purchased a home or have got
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
relationships in the community so it
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
really is it's very similar to the uh to
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
the ndea loans that uh at least maybe
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh Ford in Ladd and
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
myself since we're the oldest folks here
 
04:45:36.368 --> 04:45:36.378 align:start position:0%
in this uh on this group I know
 
04:45:39.170 --> 04:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
the federal government provided in the
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
late 60s provided this kind of this kind
 
04:45:46.090 --> 04:45:46.100 align:start position:0%
of a thing to incentivize folks to teach
 
04:45:48.890 --> 04:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
and uh so I think that was kind of in
 
04:45:50.448 --> 04:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
the back of my mind as I looked at the
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
original bill says now that doesn't
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
really deal with it this really I think
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
is much more focused on on what it's all
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
about so that's kind of the that's the
 
04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
intent of it anyway
 
04:46:03.890 --> 04:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
can we go back and discuss first of all
 
04:46:06.288 --> 04:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
how you selected the
 
04:46:08.930 --> 04:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
rule underperforming School educator
 
04:46:10.970 --> 04:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
rural School District underperforming
 
04:46:10.980 --> 04:46:12.230 align:start position:0%
rural School District underperforming
school

04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:46:12.240 --> 04:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
school
um

04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:13.920 --> 04:46:15.530 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:18.170 --> 04:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
um yes it is hard if your rule in
 
04:46:20.590 --> 04:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
geographically isolated
 
04:46:22.730 --> 04:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
to attract
 
04:46:24.770 --> 04:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's hard to attract if you don't have
 
04:46:28.128 --> 04:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
the property base or the salary level to
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
compete against the wealthy District
 
04:46:33.530 --> 04:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
and of course if you have an
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
underperforming School
 
04:46:38.570 --> 04:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:40.550 --> 04:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
do these categories captured the three
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
areas I just mentioned yeah
 
04:46:45.890 --> 04:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
the low income which one does that well
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
well I'm assuming that some of your
 
04:46:50.448 --> 04:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
rural schools are going to be in
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
are not going to be as wealthy as your
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh some of the other districts service
 
04:46:57.708 --> 04:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
so you have rule like Waterville Valley
 
04:46:57.718 --> 04:47:01.550 align:start position:0%
so you have rule like Waterville Valley
no

04:47:01.550 --> 04:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.560 --> 04:47:05.570 align:start position:0%
 
disadvantages

04:47:05.570 --> 04:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:05.580 --> 04:47:06.530 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:47:09.170 --> 04:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
so that yeah
 
04:47:12.170 --> 04:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
well Waterville Valley would qualify as
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.050 --> 04:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.060 --> 04:47:35.208 align:start position:0%
 
offices

04:47:35.208 --> 04:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:38.410 --> 04:47:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.288 --> 04:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
yeah so I yeah that that word or makes
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
it any of the three
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
um and I the only other issue I would
 
04:47:48.890 --> 04:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
say with Rural and maybe it's just an
 
04:47:52.970 --> 04:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
elimination of a solves it but I the way
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
that this is you know I wouldn't want to
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
see a city school
 
04:47:57.600 --> 04:47:59.750 align:start position:0%
see a city school
potentially

04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
be be left out I think that we discussed
 
04:48:03.770 --> 04:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to disclose this curtain I
 
04:48:05.930 --> 04:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
can't see the paper but I wonder if just
 
04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
removing rural altogether and using B
 
04:48:09.470 --> 04:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
and C
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
might accomplish the same thing with
 
04:48:14.208 --> 04:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
say that again eliminate a
 
04:48:31.850 --> 04:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
well you you just you would look at B
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
and C now is qualifiers B or C but you
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
would take out a so Waterville Valley if
 
04:48:42.650 --> 04:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
they don't qualify under B or C then it
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.830 --> 04:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
are there some rule though that that
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
might have a hard time hiring teachers
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
that aren't B and C but aren't
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:48:58.970 --> 04:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
you know they're not economically
 
04:49:00.170 --> 04:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged they're not
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
underperforming but they but they're so
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
don't have a hard time getting teachers
 
04:49:11.330 --> 04:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
to stay or I don't know do you not do
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I I mean I think that
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:17.280 --> 04:49:20.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:49:20.890 --> 04:49:20.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
but it's my sense in talking to
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents that some of the the
 
04:49:28.970 --> 04:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
shortage areas really cut across
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
geography and and economics you know
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
math science special ed those really
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem the only determining Factor
 
04:49:39.650 --> 04:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
seems to be the districts that pay the
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
most for those get those folks
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily come down to
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know Pittsburgh can't hire them but
 
04:49:51.770 --> 04:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
Concord can due to geography it seems
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
really to be much more compensation yeah
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why rural was in here
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
that that was one of the issues that we
 
04:50:01.730 --> 04:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
dealt with in the teacher shortage work
 
04:50:04.368 --> 04:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
group that we had that there was a
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
concern about that so
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
um that was what comes to say that's why
 
04:50:10.730 --> 04:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
that was in there that term was used
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we turn that phrase
 
04:50:18.530 --> 04:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
around a little bit an underperforming
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
School educator
 
04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
you see where the adjective goes it
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
makes the teacher underperforming not
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
the school
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
well the kids were concerned about
 
04:50:31.628 --> 04:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
they might want to rephrase that anyway
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about item uh line eight
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
just to use line three words yeah but it
 
04:50:41.288 --> 04:50:41.298 align:start position:0%
did line three and ax
 
04:50:44.890 --> 04:50:44.900 align:start position:0%
establishing to talk to me
 
04:50:48.170 --> 04:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
underperforming School educator and said
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to enter incentivize
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
it should just be a educator in an
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.890 --> 04:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
yeah it picks up down there yeah uh
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
line eight that too yeah it's consistent
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
you want a most School educator up in
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
front of underperforming have
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
underperforming in front of the of
 
04:51:35.820 --> 04:51:36.948 align:start position:0%
underperforming in front of the of
school

04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's just the phrase I'm not the son of
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
a substantial point
 
04:51:45.170 --> 04:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
one thing that concerns me about this is
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
um not everybody graduated from a New
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school and you may have
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
teachers you want to retain who
 
04:51:54.970 --> 04:51:54.980 align:start position:0%
graduated from a school in another state
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
and we don't I don't know how we can
 
04:51:59.330 --> 04:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
waive their loans
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't come out of our
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
budget well these these grants are
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
coming out of our imaginary school
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
education yeah
 
04:52:10.430 --> 04:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we just go to them as a grant
 
04:52:14.810 --> 04:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
not as a payoff for all that to well
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
that that's going to get down into some
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the other questions we have
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
do we pay them as they go or do we pay
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
them after they've been in the state
 
04:52:23.090 --> 04:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
five years
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
or or so they don't leave yeah that
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
defines it too
 
04:52:32.090 --> 04:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
stay in the anticipation of getting the
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
money in four years hopefully
 
04:52:35.040 --> 04:52:38.330 align:start position:0%
money in four years hopefully
so

04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
Steve do you have we we discussed this
 
04:52:43.788 --> 04:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
on the teacher shortage committee
 
04:52:46.970 --> 04:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
and there was this discussion uh
 
04:52:49.550 --> 04:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
do we give a loan out right at the
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
beginning or do we hold off and or it's
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
done differently from state to state
 
04:52:56.330 --> 04:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes it is and it seems just again very
 
04:53:02.990 --> 04:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
very loose anesthetical discussions I've
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
had with counterparts around the country
 
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
that the yearly is a much more
 
04:53:06.900 --> 04:53:08.990 align:start position:0%
that the yearly is a much more
attractive

04:53:08.990 --> 04:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
04:53:11.930 --> 04:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
um set up than a lump sum at the end
 
04:53:13.730 --> 04:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you know if we say and you know four
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
years from now you're gonna get twenty
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars four years a long
 
04:53:19.368 --> 04:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
way away and legislatively a lot can
 
04:53:20.830 --> 04:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
happen in that time
 
04:53:25.250 --> 04:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
so uh it seems better I've heard of more
 
04:53:28.490 --> 04:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
success doing it on an annual basis okay
 
04:53:28.500 --> 04:53:41.230 align:start position:0%
success doing it on an annual basis okay
um

04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:47.810 --> 04:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
I would say the majority of them are
 
04:53:50.930 --> 04:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
oh sorry so I'm comparing this document
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
that Brian Hawkins from Nea did of what
 
04:53:54.650 --> 04:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
the other states are doing
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
and it looks like a majority of them are
 
04:53:58.010 --> 04:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
at least this amount of money if not
 
04:53:58.020 --> 04:53:59.330 align:start position:0%
at least this amount of money if not
more

04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:54:03.230 --> 04:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
and almost all of them are yearly
 
04:54:06.170 --> 04:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
not cumulative at the end but pay as you
 
04:54:07.610 --> 04:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
go basically
 
04:54:13.680 --> 04:54:13.690 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:13.690 --> 04:54:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:54:17.810 --> 04:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
um where it says in the beginning the
 
04:54:20.090 --> 04:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
doe shall identify the schools and then
 
04:54:22.550 --> 04:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
it goes into rural isolation does that
 
04:54:24.170 --> 04:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
mean right at the beginning while you
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
know one two three
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
um does that mean so let's say if it
 
04:54:30.890 --> 04:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
were a Waterville Valley could they say
 
04:54:33.530 --> 04:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
you know they are rule but they're not
 
04:54:35.530 --> 04:54:35.540 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged
 
04:54:39.050 --> 04:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
is it all schools at Fitness or the doe
 
04:54:39.060 --> 04:54:40.670 align:start position:0%
is it all schools at Fitness or the doe
decide

04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
decide
 
04:54:42.650 --> 04:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes there were no
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
on the Waterville Valley
 
04:54:46.970 --> 04:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
well I think thank you I think the
 
04:54:48.530 --> 04:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
current way that it's written it would
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
be its or
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
or so they just have to meet one of the
 
04:54:55.610 --> 04:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
three to qualify so if they meet number
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
one they're in the way that it's
 
04:54:59.448 --> 04:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
04:55:06.610 --> 04:55:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.530 --> 04:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
it is to deal with those who are having
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
a difficult time in hiring teachers
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
your your example of Waterville Valley I
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I hadn't thought about that
 
04:55:25.970 --> 04:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
Rick that's a good point I'm not sure
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
that they have a problem in hiring
 
04:55:30.170 --> 04:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
teachers in Waterville Valley or not um
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
but that was the intent
 
04:55:33.000 --> 04:55:34.430 align:start position:0%
but that was the intent
um

04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:36.890 --> 04:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
and again we talked about the rural
 
04:55:38.690 --> 04:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
isolation as being a problem of
 
04:55:40.610 --> 04:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and I think your
 
04:55:42.410 --> 04:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
superintendents would also concur that
 
04:55:44.030 --> 04:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
that has been a problem particularly as
 
04:55:46.128 --> 04:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
you deal with those in the North country
 
04:55:49.250 --> 04:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
or those way over in the north east the
 
04:55:51.170 --> 04:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
Northeast part of the state and even the
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
well it's very expensive to have rural
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
will be the focus
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't want page two would be and
 
04:56:07.868 --> 04:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
well I think that's one of the pro I
 
04:56:12.590 --> 04:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
mean one of the things we found that is
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
one problem the other problem is those
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
where you have uh High need teaching
 
04:56:21.410 --> 04:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
areas that are that are hard to recruit
 
04:56:24.410 --> 04:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
and I think I I don't I frankly think
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that's somewhat comparable uh it's
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
not either an either or kind of a
 
04:56:29.280 --> 04:56:38.170 align:start position:0%
not either an either or kind of a
situation

04:56:38.170 --> 04:56:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.650 --> 04:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
they based it on poverty on if if the
 
04:56:44.448 --> 04:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
town had a certain level of poverty you
 
04:56:46.368 --> 04:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
could possibly tie it to three and
 
04:56:51.910 --> 04:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:54.170 --> 04:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
well I assume you have to have we want
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
to have to have standards for all for
 
04:56:57.708 --> 04:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
all three of these if it's rural schools
 
04:56:59.208 --> 04:56:59.218 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a stand what's a rural
 
04:57:01.730 --> 04:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
school there's no other school within 25
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
miles or there's there's a definition on
 
04:57:07.550 --> 04:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
that talking about but okay perhaps yes
 
04:57:10.610 --> 04:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
rural School small rural School
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
this thing's going down the tubes
 
04:57:16.430 --> 04:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
um and why I say that is we had a bill
 
04:57:19.490 --> 04:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
dealing with geographic location and all
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
that way back in the years that Emma
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
Rouse was chair
 
04:57:26.690 --> 04:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
and Senator Lou dalzandro was the one
 
04:57:28.368 --> 04:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
who climbed all over us saying well I'm
 
04:57:30.050 --> 04:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
going to start having small schools in
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
04:57:33.530 --> 04:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
because we have the poverty we have the
 
04:57:35.810 --> 04:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
need but now you're saying it's got to
 
04:57:37.850 --> 04:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
be geographically isolated or a small
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
school out in the hinterland so I think
 
04:57:42.650 --> 04:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
we've got to be very careful here that
 
04:57:45.050 --> 04:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
we do hit the places where poverty
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
exists it may be in the middle of a city
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
well that's not a track that's one of
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons why it's talked about
 
04:57:54.350 --> 04:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
economic disadvantage that that that I
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
would think with the poverty piece yeah
 
04:57:58.490 --> 04:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
because that was clearly one of the
 
04:58:01.610 --> 04:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
issues too so somebody mentioned earlier
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
well could a city school get some of
 
04:58:07.250 --> 04:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
this yes they could based upon uh the
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
definition here of uh of economic
 
04:58:09.718 --> 04:58:14.868 align:start position:0%
definition here of uh of economic
disadvantage

04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
Mel does that require you to define the
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
road the urban school it's
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
underperforming well I I again I'm
 
04:58:26.510 --> 04:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
relying somewhat on the department in
 
04:58:29.208 --> 04:58:29.218 align:start position:0%
their definitions uh Oliver uh I didn't
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to get into
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
the total definitions in the law because
 
04:58:34.970 --> 04:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's why it was really defers to the
 
04:58:34.980 --> 04:58:36.470 align:start position:0%
that's why it was really defers to the
Departments

04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
Departments
 
04:58:40.970 --> 04:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
definition of you know need and uh
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantage Etc because I think Steve
 
04:58:46.128 --> 04:58:46.138 align:start position:0%
shaken has said yes they do do that so
 
04:58:47.930 --> 04:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
that that they would be yeah they would
 
04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
be the ones that that would uh maybe
 
04:58:52.128 --> 04:58:52.138 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have that tag put around
 
04:58:54.610 --> 04:58:54.620 align:start position:0%
their neck do they
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
when you say that that underperforming
 
04:58:57.420 --> 04:58:59.350 align:start position:0%
when you say that that underperforming
or

04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
every year and it doesn't come out of my
 
04:59:04.430 --> 04:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
division so I'm only remotely familiar
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
um but I I mean you know for example the
 
04:59:08.570 --> 04:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
nape scores right I know we do all kinds
 
04:59:11.330 --> 04:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
of assessment testing right and we
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
bucket schools based on scores so of um
 
04:59:16.730 --> 04:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
I'm relatively certain there's a
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism here that we identify these
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:23.638 --> 04:59:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:59:25.250 --> 04:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:59:27.288 --> 04:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
just go ahead so
 
04:59:29.810 --> 04:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
the first page defines rural isolation
 
04:59:32.690 --> 04:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
and it defines underperformed School
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't see
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
definition of economic disadvantage
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
except on the page two line four where
 
04:59:43.010 --> 04:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
they talk about related to Title One
 
04:59:44.930 --> 04:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
so my question would be is that adequate
 
04:59:46.970 --> 04:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
definition of economic disadvantage to
 
04:59:46.980 --> 04:59:48.410 align:start position:0%
definition of economic disadvantage to
encompass

04:59:48.410 --> 04:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
encompass
 
04:59:50.090 --> 04:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
City Schools like Manchester or
 
04:59:50.100 --> 04:59:51.230 align:start position:0%
City Schools like Manchester or
Claremont

04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
Claremont
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
if they didn't qualify well Karma will
 
04:59:56.330 --> 04:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
qualify and be underperforming but
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
I may ask my coder at my peer director
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
who oversees Title One if that works
 
05:00:02.638 --> 05:00:13.610 align:start position:0%
who oversees Title One if that works
sorry

05:00:13.610 --> 05:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.128 --> 05:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
so it's this
 
05:00:16.138 --> 05:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
so it's this
um

05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's this is that sufficient enough to
 
05:00:20.520 --> 05:00:24.310 align:start position:0%
it's this is that sufficient enough to
to

05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:28.128 --> 05:00:28.138 align:start position:0%
so Title One funds are distributed based
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
on the U.S Census Bureau poverty
 
05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
identification so if
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's where you'd want to identify then
 
05:00:40.730 --> 05:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
I'd say that that's okay I know there's
 
05:00:43.788 --> 05:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion with other
 
05:00:45.650 --> 05:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation about that
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
determination because it's i i a U.S
 
05:00:52.208 --> 05:00:52.218 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau determination versus
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
actual poverty numbers it's not free and
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
reduced numbers so there's you're not
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to miss that
 
05:01:01.550 --> 05:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
component that that population and it
 
05:01:01.560 --> 05:01:02.868 align:start position:0%
component that that population and it
may

05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:01:05.150 --> 05:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
not be the way you want to go I it's
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
just it's just determine basically on
 
05:01:11.930 --> 05:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
what you'd want to accomplish with it
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
so all schools are going to receive a
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
title 1 allocation
 
05:01:20.208 --> 05:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
just the amount that is utilized is
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to be dependent upon those uh U.S
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau numbers
 
05:01:27.770 --> 05:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
so if I'm understanding what you're
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
saying then if all schools are getting
 
05:01:32.330 --> 05:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
some amount of Title One
 
05:01:35.208 --> 05:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
no way no all schools don't get Title
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
One all leas yes leas yes but that's
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
what she's saying schools correct
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for the distinction
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
and since that's based on Census Bureau
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
data does that mean it only changes
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
 
05:01:50.638 --> 05:01:52.070 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
correct

05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
um data that is reported at that county
 
05:01:59.040 --> 05:02:00.288 align:start position:0%
um data that is reported at that county
level

05:02:00.288 --> 05:02:00.298 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:02:02.690 --> 05:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
or at that time level but it's a
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
different set of numbers compared to the
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
free and reduced and that's a different
 
05:02:07.970 --> 05:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
program that's U.S department of
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture so that's going to be a
 
05:02:09.600 --> 05:02:10.670 align:start position:0%
Agriculture so that's going to be a
different

05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:02:10.680 --> 05:02:12.650 align:start position:0%
different
determination

05:02:12.650 --> 05:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
determination
 
05:02:14.570 --> 05:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you want to go with
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:21.288 --> 05:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
ignoring the U.S census sometimes is
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
very very misleading especially if
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're doing it by county
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the area I live in Grafton county is
 
05:02:31.490 --> 05:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
poverty but if you look at Grafton
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
County it's the second highest you know
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
income area in the state because of
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hanover Lebanon and Plymouth but when
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
you get to Warren and rumney and Benton
 
05:02:45.770 --> 05:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
and all those others it's low so if
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have
 
05:02:49.550 --> 05:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
and that's it free and reduced in that
 
05:02:51.170 --> 05:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
particular school district is a better
 
05:02:54.170 --> 05:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
identifier I believe than using the U.S
 
05:02:54.180 --> 05:02:58.010 align:start position:0%
identifier I believe than using the U.S
census

05:02:58.010 --> 05:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be determined by
 
05:03:00.120 --> 05:03:01.910 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be determined by
school

05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:03:04.128 --> 05:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
yeah so it has to do with a teacher
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
teaching in a school that meets one of
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
those criteria getting some enrollments
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
so you could have an instance where you
 
05:03:13.010 --> 05:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
had a district
 
05:03:16.010 --> 05:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
um let's say that has
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
a title one allocation coming in at the
 
05:03:20.448 --> 05:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
Lea level so they might determine okay
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have you know three elementary
 
05:03:24.410 --> 05:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
schools a middle school and a high
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
school we are going to use our entire
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
entire Title One allocation to focus on
 
05:03:32.570 --> 05:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
the two of the elementary schools and
 
05:03:34.628 --> 05:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
then we'll put all the funds towards
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
supporting that area as opposed to
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
putting any towards the middle or the
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
high school so it's really a local
 
05:03:42.600 --> 05:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
high school so it's really a local
decision

05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:03:46.730 --> 05:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
so when it um and looking at this a
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
little bit closer
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
basing it on the school
 
05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
and the determination for title one may
 
05:03:54.540 --> 05:03:56.030 align:start position:0%
and the determination for title one may
not

05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:03:58.850 --> 05:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
be what you're hoping to accomplish you
 
05:04:00.770 --> 05:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
might use a different what if we took
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
another way rather than try to define
 
05:04:06.050 --> 05:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
the deficiency just say schools
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
identified by the Department of
 
05:04:10.610 --> 05:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
Education as facing exceptional
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
challenges of various kinds maybe we
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
just let you decide make it official no
 
05:04:19.550 --> 05:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
no no no no no that so wishy-washy
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
criteria that's going to be abused be
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah it'll be it and yet when
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
we changed from No Child Left Behind and
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
rewrote our rules for Essa one of the
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
things we are looking at is title one we
 
05:04:35.810 --> 05:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
found out of the high schools how many
 
05:04:37.368 --> 05:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
high schools at that time were receiving
 
05:04:39.010 --> 05:04:39.020 align:start position:0%
Title One you could count them on a hand
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
very very few because the money the
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
resources were geared down to the grade
 
05:04:44.160 --> 05:04:45.350 align:start position:0%
resources were geared down to the grade
schools

05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
so where Title One money s is not a good
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
way to do this either I don't believe
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
I'd rather do it where
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
especially if we're going to have a good
 
05:04:57.890 --> 05:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
idea where the F and R is
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that we basically do I think have a
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea the number of
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
qualifiers in a school and I would do it
 
05:05:04.798 --> 05:05:06.170 align:start position:0%
qualifiers in a school and I would do it
by

05:05:06.170 --> 05:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:05:07.788 --> 05:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'd rather do it by
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
district is awkwardly for for allocation
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the dollars
 
05:05:15.708 --> 05:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
to attract the leas hiring these people
 
05:05:17.810 --> 05:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
not the school
 
05:05:20.208 --> 05:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
but the the local district is one that's
 
05:05:20.218 --> 05:05:21.530 align:start position:0%
but the the local district is one that's
hurting

05:05:21.530 --> 05:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
hurting
 
05:05:25.128 --> 05:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
so use F and R and piggybacking on that
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
that does sound like using f r is a
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
better measure than using the title one
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
but I've been wondering especially if we
 
05:05:38.570 --> 05:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
do use fnr we've talked about the fact
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
that we don't see as many kids on the
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
high school level that that
 
05:05:44.448 --> 05:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
documentation is completed but in my
 
05:05:45.650 --> 05:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
districts the high schools would
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
definitely have teachers who
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
they have teacher shortages that should
 
05:05:52.128 --> 05:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
be addressed so
 
05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
I think they do a new webinar for the
 
05:05:57.708 --> 05:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
district not when we had the finance
 
05:05:59.090 --> 05:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
deal we were putting together and we're
 
05:06:01.970 --> 05:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
doing the slide for those which like 12
 
05:06:05.810 --> 05:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
1.2 million 1.4 million down then there
 
05:06:07.610 --> 05:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
was a little added on that I put in
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
there trying to give those schools above
 
05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
that that had Title One there was going
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be a little extra given to them but
 
05:06:17.208 --> 05:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
doe couldn't come across with that as
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
I guess either way if you're looking at
 
05:06:25.850 --> 05:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
free and reduced numbers or you're
 
05:06:28.128 --> 05:06:28.138 align:start position:0%
looking at title one allocations and if
 
05:06:30.050 --> 05:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
we're looking at Distributing it at the
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
Lea level I mean
 
05:06:34.090 --> 05:06:34.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to be looking at Manchester
 
05:06:38.330 --> 05:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.090 --> 05:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
those are great because because they
 
05:06:43.250 --> 05:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
have some of the largest I'm just
 
05:06:44.628 --> 05:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
picking up like the top three because
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
they have the largest population
 
05:06:50.448 --> 05:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
so therefore they automatically receive
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
the highest allocation
 
05:06:54.590 --> 05:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
because they're serving a higher number
 
05:06:56.330 --> 05:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
of students
 
05:06:59.810 --> 05:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
but I think you could also
 
05:07:02.208 --> 05:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
Rick I think I think you could do it
 
05:07:02.218 --> 05:07:03.288 align:start position:0%
Rick I think I think you could do it
using

05:07:03.288 --> 05:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:07:06.530 --> 05:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm sort of I sort of hesitate uh
 
05:07:08.090 --> 05:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
referring specifically to free
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
introduced price launch if we could just
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
do that one place in the law and then
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
05:07:13.920 --> 05:07:18.788 align:start position:0%
refer to
um

05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know because that that may change
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
down the road with with direct
 
05:07:23.520 --> 05:07:25.190 align:start position:0%
down the road with with direct
certification

05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know but if you could if we could
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
you know the department the department
 
05:07:39.410 --> 05:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
keeps the the uh you know has the the
 
05:07:42.288 --> 05:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
ratio of of free and reduced price lunch
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
to to the total number to the total ADM
 
05:07:51.170 --> 05:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
yeah and just set a cut line somewhere
 
05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
I think you could do that I also think
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
you need to do that something to the
 
05:07:57.650 --> 05:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
fact that Pittsburgh for example
 
05:08:00.110 --> 05:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
who wants to move to Pittsburgh where if
 
05:08:01.550 --> 05:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
you've been to the General Store up
 
05:08:03.650 --> 05:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
there you're going to find all the
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
prices are double although gasoline's
 
05:08:07.970 --> 05:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
cheaper in Pittsburgh than it is in
 
05:08:07.980 --> 05:08:08.990 align:start position:0%
cheaper in Pittsburgh than it is in
Haverhill

05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
Haverhill
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh but you know it's isolated and you
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
can't have access to a university or a
 
05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
college the way you can if you're living
 
05:08:19.250 --> 05:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
down in Plymouth
 
05:08:22.368 --> 05:08:22.378 align:start position:0%
so where I've lived before and I've
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
lived in some very rural areas
 
05:08:28.250 --> 05:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
that you probably don't want to see the
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
only way to get there was by boat or by
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
plane and those were truly
 
05:08:35.570 --> 05:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
geographically isolated and we gave a
 
05:08:37.550 --> 05:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
huge bonus to people even come work
 
05:08:37.560 --> 05:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
huge bonus to people even come work
there

05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:08:39.120 --> 05:08:40.010 align:start position:0%
there
um

05:08:40.010 --> 05:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
that's different than this state's
 
05:08:44.208 --> 05:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
pretty small
 
05:08:46.250 --> 05:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
we do have rural areas we have a hard
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
time attracting to but it's not like
 
05:08:51.170 --> 05:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
some other states that like in the
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
midwest the west and Alaska right yeah
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
or you could tie it to um
 
05:09:00.170 --> 05:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
this would actually bring water Valley
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
back into the equation but the economic
 
05:09:07.628 --> 05:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:10.250 --> 05:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
you're tired to average household income
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
in a given town
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah through the ACs now average
 
05:09:17.390 --> 05:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
household income would certainly help
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
Lincoln right
 
05:09:20.340 --> 05:09:22.128 align:start position:0%
Lincoln right
yeah

05:09:22.128 --> 05:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:09:22.138 --> 05:09:22.868 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:09:26.208 --> 05:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
Woodstock yeah absolutely the property
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
values which screw you up
 
05:09:31.690 --> 05:09:31.700 align:start position:0%
they go up but the income levels are
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.638 --> 05:09:38.170 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:09:38.170 --> 05:09:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:41.810 --> 05:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
where are you going to get that data
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
or the median income you only get it
 
05:09:45.470 --> 05:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
from ACS
 
05:09:48.410 --> 05:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
what is ACS we have that don't we the
 
05:09:51.970 --> 05:09:51.980 align:start position:0%
census but
 
05:09:55.128 --> 05:09:55.138 align:start position:0%
that's the American American Community
 
05:09:55.138 --> 05:09:56.990 align:start position:0%
that's the American American Community
survey

05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
survey
 
05:09:57.000 --> 05:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
survey
um

05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:00.410 --> 05:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
and you know Doug Hall who's probably
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
done as much research as anybody
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire on this
 
05:10:07.550 --> 05:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
um has has talked about that how that
 
05:10:10.010 --> 05:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
data is really not so reliable on a
 
05:10:12.050 --> 05:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
granular basis throughout the state
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't that's why the
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
so so
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
um are you really trying to get things
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know but are we so are we I'm trying
 
05:10:26.090 --> 05:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
to figure out where we are here
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to make this as simple as
 
05:10:28.680 --> 05:10:30.708 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to make this as simple as
possible

05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:10:35.470 --> 05:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
and I mean so the intent is to provide
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
this program for for teachers who'll be
 
05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
teaching and underperforming schools you
 
05:10:44.690 --> 05:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.700 --> 05:10:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:46.970 --> 05:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.980 --> 05:10:48.288 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:10:48.288 --> 05:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:50.270 --> 05:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I'd say let's just use the term I
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
don't like the term but economically
 
05:10:54.770 --> 05:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged communities
 
05:10:58.610 --> 05:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate the
 
05:11:00.410 --> 05:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate the Waterville
 
05:11:03.230 --> 05:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
valleys of the world that are small
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
um are there is there another category
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and and also the issue of
 
05:11:14.160 --> 05:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
uh and and and also the issue of
um

05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
those uh teaching areas that are in need
 
05:11:20.750 --> 05:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh what's the term should I use not
 
05:11:22.550 --> 05:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
critical shortage critical thank you
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
no you think critical shoulders if the
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
Chancery is that a rural no I'm not not
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
at all is that critical show is going to
 
05:11:36.770 --> 05:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
be a third identifier yeah
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
I I might caution against using critical
 
05:11:42.170 --> 05:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
shortages as a b or c
 
05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
because then you could be faced with
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley we've identified a
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
critical shortage in Math teachers what
 
05:11:50.330 --> 05:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
are the value means a math teacher if
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to you know using them as
 
05:11:53.208 --> 05:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
an example
 
05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
um then they would qualify so let's use
 
05:11:57.948 --> 05:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
that as an example though
 
05:12:01.490 --> 05:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
so let's say I have a teacher there and
 
05:12:05.628 --> 05:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
they apply they apply for the
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the loan
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
and the department would then determine
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
well no because
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
you may have this math teacher there but
 
05:12:19.368 --> 05:12:19.378 align:start position:0%
we've got other other areas in the queue
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
that have a higher need
 
05:12:24.530 --> 05:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
than Waterville valid
 
05:12:27.050 --> 05:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just trying to figure out how
 
05:12:29.690 --> 05:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
the discretion discretionary from a
 
05:12:32.208 --> 05:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
standpoint once the application gets to
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
05:12:35.690 --> 05:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
and they make some determination of
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a an appropriate
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh allocation of their loan
 
05:12:40.798 --> 05:12:42.288 align:start position:0%
uh allocation of their loan
reimbursement

05:12:42.288 --> 05:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:12:44.690 --> 05:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
would that be a could that be a trigger
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
point too
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
or do you not want to have to make that
 
05:12:51.170 --> 05:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
determination which I would understand I
 
05:12:52.610 --> 05:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone wants us to make
 
05:12:54.890 --> 05:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
that determination I I think that the
 
05:12:57.050 --> 05:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
the clearer this can be written so it's
 
05:12:59.330 --> 05:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
fairly black and white because I I just
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
Envision a scenario where we're going to
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
have Educators complaining
 
05:13:06.170 --> 05:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
what do you mean I don't qualify you
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
know and what I don't want to do is
 
05:13:10.250 --> 05:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
create a situation is where we have
 
05:13:13.330 --> 05:13:13.340 align:start position:0%
educator against educator
 
05:13:15.770 --> 05:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
what was the first category you had read
 
05:13:15.780 --> 05:13:17.930 align:start position:0%
what was the first category you had read
there

05:13:17.930 --> 05:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:13:21.650 --> 05:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh that I'm trying right now I you know
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
when we were going through you started
 
05:13:25.868 --> 05:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
over again what was the first category
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
that that was two minutes ago Rick you
 
05:13:30.850 --> 05:13:30.860 align:start position:0%
think I can remember that
 
05:13:33.590 --> 05:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's underperforming okay performing
 
05:13:33.600 --> 05:13:34.368 align:start position:0%
it's underperforming okay performing
right

05:13:34.368 --> 05:13:34.378 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:13:37.550 --> 05:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
just to mention that
 
05:13:37.560 --> 05:13:38.390 align:start position:0%
just to mention that
um

05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:40.610 --> 05:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
so line six underperforming School based
 
05:13:42.770 --> 05:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
on below average nape scores compared to
 
05:13:45.410 --> 05:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide averages so not every school
 
05:13:50.170 --> 05:13:50.180 align:start position:0%
takes nape every year yeah so that
 
05:13:54.288 --> 05:13:54.298 align:start position:0%
may be an issue and you may want to look
 
05:13:56.570 --> 05:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
at Statewide assessment scores or just
 
05:13:58.490 --> 05:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
leave it at Statewide assessment
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
um just because of that with Nate not
 
05:14:02.930 --> 05:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
all schools are taking that every year
 
05:14:05.090 --> 05:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
and that's just going to be
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
at the fourth grade
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
and then I think again at eighth grade
 
05:14:11.690 --> 05:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
05:14:13.490 --> 05:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's not like our Statewide assessment
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
system that's being administered
 
05:14:19.128 --> 05:14:19.138 align:start position:0%
third through eighth every year
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
you would say below an average Statewide
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
scores State yeah below average
 
05:14:31.368 --> 05:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
averages and and removed nape scores
 
05:14:37.850 --> 05:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
when we have to have this reported us is
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
it has an FN on it so that's an early
 
05:14:43.490 --> 05:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
bill right no let's see it's 6 23. hold
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
on I'm just trying to figure out the
 
05:14:54.670 --> 05:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill
 
05:15:02.208 --> 05:15:02.218 align:start position:0%
all right so um this is this is a this
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
has been valuable I think I need to sit
 
05:15:05.690 --> 05:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
down with
 
05:15:09.288 --> 05:15:09.298 align:start position:0%
with you guys and um
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
determine this a little bit more come
 
05:15:13.850 --> 05:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
back with them uh yet another do we all
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
agree of underperforming is should be
 
05:15:18.170 --> 05:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
part of the equation yeah yes do we all
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
agree property poor should be
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
part of the equation property core
 
05:15:22.560 --> 05:15:23.930 align:start position:0%
part of the equation property core
community

05:15:23.930 --> 05:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:15:25.730 --> 05:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be pretty hard to attract
 
05:15:26.930 --> 05:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
them if you don't have you know the
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
money to compete
 
05:15:31.850 --> 05:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
and what about critical shortage
 
05:15:31.860 --> 05:15:36.770 align:start position:0%
and what about critical shortage
income

05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.780 --> 05:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:42.110 --> 05:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so okay yeah probably four
 
05:15:43.610 --> 05:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
versus income how about the critical
 
05:15:45.050 --> 05:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
need thing I would think critical
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:52.010 --> 05:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
you just wouldn't make it a determining
 
05:15:54.170 --> 05:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
a b or c I would put critical shortage
 
05:15:57.730 --> 05:15:57.740 align:start position:0%
elsewhere yeah to say it only applies to
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
in critical shortage areas or something
 
05:16:04.250 --> 05:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
I mean we can come up with some language
 
05:16:05.448 --> 05:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
um but I I wouldn't make it a
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
determinant of Eligibility so much as no
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of below the line so to
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
speak because if you make a determine
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna you know Bedford needs
 
05:16:16.250 --> 05:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
a math teacher
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're gonna you know and I don't think
 
05:16:19.850 --> 05:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's the intent
 
05:16:21.770 --> 05:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
right okay so this only applies to
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
critical shortage areas in locations
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are underperforming and property
 
05:16:26.520 --> 05:16:34.628 align:start position:0%
that are underperforming and property
poor

05:16:34.628 --> 05:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
always out
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
well you're not going to be able to get
 
05:16:40.610 --> 05:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
a loan for becoming an elementary
 
05:16:42.050 --> 05:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
teacher right
 
05:16:44.208 --> 05:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
you're going to get if you're science
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
math special education is that what
 
05:16:49.390 --> 05:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing Steve
 
05:16:52.128 --> 05:16:52.138 align:start position:0%
it'll be any critical shortage area yeah
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
any critical shortage area and it just
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
those are always on the list right other
 
05:16:58.270 --> 05:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
ones others go on and off the list
 
05:17:01.010 --> 05:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
Elementary goes on and off that's
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
correct we should we should also maybe
 
05:17:05.150 --> 05:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
offline talk about what do we do for an
 
05:17:06.708 --> 05:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
educator who starts in Pittsburgh
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
teaching Elementary edits on the
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
critical shortage list so they get the
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
first year second year we do the survey
 
05:17:14.570 --> 05:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's off the list as a critical shortage
 
05:17:16.970 --> 05:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
do they not get a reimbursement second
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
year or so we should probably think
 
05:17:22.010 --> 05:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
through that scenario all right so this
 
05:17:24.530 --> 05:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
has been hell for me this has been
 
05:17:27.490 --> 05:17:27.500 align:start position:0%
Health let's stop this and I'll
 
05:17:30.170 --> 05:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
I'll meet with Stephen
 
05:17:32.030 --> 05:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
come back this has been helpful thank
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
you yeah we have a little time we have
 
05:17:35.770 --> 05:17:35.780 align:start position:0%
to March 16th
 
05:17:38.810 --> 05:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
oh plenty of time that's only a few
 
05:17:42.550 --> 05:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
weeks away okay
 
05:17:46.090 --> 05:17:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
okay let's go back up to uh 377
 
05:17:51.890 --> 05:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's the relative to screening and
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
intervention public schools for dyslexia
 
05:17:56.208 --> 05:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
and then when the policy is relative to
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
reading assessment and invention program
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
so that's what we have left in the
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
docket for today
 
05:18:01.760 --> 05:18:03.288 align:start position:0%
docket for today
377.

05:18:03.288 --> 05:18:03.298 align:start position:0%
377.
 
05:18:03.298 --> 05:18:07.610 align:start position:0%
377.
yeah

05:18:07.610 --> 05:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:25.730 --> 05:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:25.740 --> 05:18:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.360 --> 05:19:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:19:03.410 --> 05:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:03.420 --> 05:19:16.448 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:16.448 --> 05:19:16.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.030 --> 05:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
so this takes out the uh the reference
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
to divals as and it changes it to
 
05:19:26.448 --> 05:19:26.458 align:start position:0%
evidence-based screener
 
05:19:26.458 --> 05:19:27.410 align:start position:0%
evidence-based screener
um

05:19:27.410 --> 05:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
takes out
 
05:19:28.920 --> 05:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
takes out
um

05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment in public kindergarten first
 
05:19:33.050 --> 05:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
grade and approach appropriate times
 
05:19:34.970 --> 05:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
thereafter to you know that whole
 
05:19:37.490 --> 05:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
sentence to just entry to public school
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the initial screening shall be completed
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
no later than 60 days of a student
 
05:19:44.030 --> 05:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
entering a public school in kindergarten
 
05:19:46.730 --> 05:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
through third grade
 
05:19:48.770 --> 05:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
um and then repeated one additional time
 
05:19:51.050 --> 05:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
during the current school year repeated
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
at a minimum of twice yearly through
 
05:19:55.070 --> 05:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
third grade so
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
um through third grade was a big
 
05:19:56.520 --> 05:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
um through third grade was a big
difference

05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
um if they fail to make the relevant
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
benchmarks uh then the school must
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
complete a secondary assessment within
 
05:20:08.110 --> 05:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
and another important part of this bill
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
right from the start was that enter
 
05:20:16.128 --> 05:20:16.138 align:start position:0%
enter some sort of interventions starts
 
05:20:17.930 --> 05:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading instruction
 
05:20:20.930 --> 05:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
intervention or referral of the student
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
to special ed for further evaluation so
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when these students get
 
05:20:27.730 --> 05:20:27.740 align:start position:0%
tested now from what I understand
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's a delay in the intervention
 
05:20:32.930 --> 05:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that the author of
 
05:20:35.868 --> 05:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
The spell wanted was to make sure that
 
05:20:37.970 --> 05:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
that stayed and then
 
05:20:41.930 --> 05:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that it refers to Charter
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
kind of cleans up the bill a little bit
 
05:20:49.200 --> 05:20:51.708 align:start position:0%
kind of cleans up the bill a little bit
um

05:20:51.708 --> 05:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:54.530 --> 05:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
I know that that representative codelli
 
05:20:56.810 --> 05:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
has tried to tried to put some of this
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
into his bill
 
05:20:58.920 --> 05:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
into his bill
um

05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
but it really needs to be in my opinion
 
05:21:04.430 --> 05:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
it needs to be a standalone because
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
dyslexia is so unique and also so
 
05:21:11.690 --> 05:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
crippling if it isn't found out so what
 
05:21:11.700 --> 05:21:12.490 align:start position:0%
crippling if it isn't found out so what
does

05:21:12.490 --> 05:21:12.500 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:21:14.510 --> 05:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli's Bill number
 
05:21:16.610 --> 05:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
I knew you were going to ask me that is
 
05:21:19.490 --> 05:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
that the reading one it's the science of
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
reading Bill 137 437 okay I want to pull
 
05:21:35.650 --> 05:21:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:50.830 --> 05:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
no his
 
05:21:54.830 --> 05:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
his well his
 
05:21:54.840 --> 05:22:06.590 align:start position:0%
his well his
name

05:22:06.590 --> 05:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:06.600 --> 05:22:07.810 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:22:07.810 --> 05:22:07.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:22:10.730 --> 05:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
those of you who have uh principal
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
experience and all I can probably answer
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
it best when I showed this to my wife
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
and my daughter my daughter says
 
05:22:20.208 --> 05:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
teaching language pathologist my wife is
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
a former state director of special ed
 
05:22:25.368 --> 05:22:25.378 align:start position:0%
they were both very enthusiastic about
 
05:22:25.378 --> 05:22:26.330 align:start position:0%
they were both very enthusiastic about
this

05:22:26.330 --> 05:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
they were very supportive of this
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
approach but they one question my wife
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
asked was what resources can a school
 
05:22:39.288 --> 05:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
sort of assume it has or can get in
 
05:22:41.628 --> 05:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
order to make that timely response that
 
05:22:43.850 --> 05:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
you were talking about they were they
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
were keyed right in on that well I think
 
05:22:47.218 --> 05:22:48.010 align:start position:0%
were keyed right in on that well I think
um

05:22:48.010 --> 05:22:48.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:50.448 --> 05:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
that the the state department of
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
education has put out uh some directives
 
05:22:55.910 --> 05:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
on it there's actually this whole little
 
05:22:58.250 --> 05:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
booklet called the resource guide for
 
05:23:00.770 --> 05:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
dyslexic and other Related Disorders I I
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
was I saw that and I was wondering but
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
where's the funding coming if the school
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it where do they get the
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
well this is this is to give resources
 
05:23:13.550 --> 05:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the to the teacher and uh um is
 
05:23:15.288 --> 05:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
Corinne here if she's left
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
um she she was saying that she trains
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
um you know as a reading specialist she
 
05:23:24.170 --> 05:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
trained people within the teaching just
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
regular teachers yeah and it and it
 
05:23:28.550 --> 05:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be I mean for dyslexia
 
05:23:30.890 --> 05:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's just to realize that they don't
 
05:23:32.750 --> 05:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
code things the way that everybody else
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
codes things and be able to start in
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
intervention to realize when instead of
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
keep pushing phonics or whatever whole
 
05:23:43.490 --> 05:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
language to this kid to stop and say
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay he's got dyslexia so I now need to
 
05:23:48.530 --> 05:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
do this and and elementary teachers have
 
05:23:48.540 --> 05:23:49.368 align:start position:0%
do this and and elementary teachers have
had

05:23:49.368 --> 05:23:49.378 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
training in this enough of that to where
 
05:23:53.810 --> 05:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
they can be start intervention and then
 
05:23:56.930 --> 05:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
work from there but as as representative
 
05:23:59.810 --> 05:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
catawb said you know her her son got
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
tested and then it was like months
 
05:24:03.770 --> 05:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
before they went you know got through
 
05:24:06.770 --> 05:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
the Special Ed type uh screening well
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
and some people resist a special ed
 
05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
identification that's true they resist
 
05:24:12.770 --> 05:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
it yes so it doesn't have to be a
 
05:24:14.208 --> 05:24:14.218 align:start position:0%
pull-out service it's something that can
 
05:24:15.530 --> 05:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
be done in the classroom when they're
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
doing reading right right just to
 
05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
realize that this yeah but then there
 
05:24:21.288 --> 05:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
are cases I get and keep in mind I know
 
05:24:23.288 --> 05:24:23.298 align:start position:0%
nothing about this is all what I'm told
 
05:24:26.208 --> 05:24:26.218 align:start position:0%
uh but there are cases where you do need
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
a specialist most definitely most
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
definitely and that's that's what they
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
were concerned are the schools going to
 
05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
have the resource to when they need to
 
05:24:36.288 --> 05:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
have a specialist to get one right then
 
05:24:39.050 --> 05:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
not later well they wouldn't get one
 
05:24:41.270 --> 05:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
right then I'm I'm sure in the in the
 
05:24:43.250 --> 05:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
poorer schools but they would this
 
05:24:46.610 --> 05:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
department of education has a reading
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
specialist right that we're talking
 
05:24:48.240 --> 05:24:49.368 align:start position:0%
specialist right that we're talking
about

05:24:49.368 --> 05:24:49.378 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
um that they can use as a as a as a
 
05:24:55.310 --> 05:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
um you know resource and they're both
 
05:24:57.530 --> 05:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
very encouraged by this approach and
 
05:24:59.810 --> 05:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
then I you know I know that as a teacher
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
when things pop up like this oftentimes
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
you can go online and you can get a lot
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
of great ideas right off the bat that so
 
05:25:07.850 --> 05:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
and and I'm sure the special ed people
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be every school has you know
 
05:25:12.110 --> 05:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
access to special ed so I'm sure that
 
05:25:16.610 --> 05:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
what is general intervention
 
05:25:22.490 --> 05:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
oh that's that's general education
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
intervention right versus the in-between
 
05:25:26.750 --> 05:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that's going on here yeah that's
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
the general so what is it
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
well it's whatever it's whatever uh the
 
05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
school has the resources the staff you
 
05:25:39.288 --> 05:25:39.298 align:start position:0%
know if it's I mean at at Kearsarge when
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
I was there we had
 
05:25:43.490 --> 05:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
a person who's who was a reading person
 
05:25:45.948 --> 05:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
so definitely at that you know and at
 
05:25:48.350 --> 05:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
the high school level it was kind of too
 
05:25:50.810 --> 05:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
way way way way too late but
 
05:25:52.970 --> 05:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I've in the district they had people
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
that were
 
05:25:56.330 --> 05:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists so some of the
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
districts that are better off are going
 
05:25:59.330 --> 05:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
to do that some of the some of the
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
districts that don't have all the
 
05:26:03.050 --> 05:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
resources are going to have to you know
 
05:26:07.070 --> 05:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
punt to get get some stuff but um I just
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
think some sort of General intervention
 
05:26:11.448 --> 05:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
is better than none and and the sooner
 
05:26:15.490 --> 05:26:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
it it it's wonderful that they do it but
 
05:26:20.930 --> 05:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
in those small districts
 
05:26:24.050 --> 05:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
you know the classroom teachers got the
 
05:26:27.708 --> 05:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
teacher of reading methods and all that
 
05:26:30.050 --> 05:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh may be able to do something but what
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
happens if the parent walks and said you
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
know you're supposed to be doing you
 
05:26:33.000 --> 05:26:33.770 align:start position:0%
know you're supposed to be doing you
know

05:26:33.770 --> 05:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
in some kind of intervention here a
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
general education intervention what are
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
you doing that's significant to get my
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
kid going I don't want to see the
 
05:26:44.930 --> 05:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher get hammered because
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
over a poor district and we you know
 
05:26:49.970 --> 05:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to pull some
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
reading support in like Haverhill just
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
did the other day when uh represent
 
05:26:56.030 --> 05:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
cascadden came in and worked at the
 
05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
middle school
 
05:27:00.890 --> 05:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
um that's that's helpful but you know
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
some smaller just may not be able to do
 
05:27:05.150 --> 05:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
that so do you think they're going to
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
get more hammered on that than they
 
05:27:10.850 --> 05:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
would get hammered If the child was
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
dyslexia dyslexic and went a year or two
 
05:27:18.410 --> 05:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
without any intervention or without or
 
05:27:20.208 --> 05:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
even a month or you know even the three
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
months until the special ed uh it's I
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
mean is is some intervention better than
 
05:27:27.410 --> 05:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
nothing absolutely okay and what you
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
what you need to do is work with those
 
05:27:31.128 --> 05:27:31.138 align:start position:0%
Specialists that you know you may have a
 
05:27:32.990 --> 05:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist available to you or
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
you might have somebody else's language
 
05:27:37.610 --> 05:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
trained that's not necessarily in this
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
domain but has ways to help right
 
05:27:42.890 --> 05:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
um but we can't pers I don't feel as
 
05:27:45.770 --> 05:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
though we need to prescribe this just
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
neither would we prescribe I don't want
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
to prescribe it either special ed
 
05:27:52.128 --> 05:27:52.138 align:start position:0%
services I mean that's all part of a
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
team at a school that's set up to deal
 
05:27:56.690 --> 05:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
with that sort of thing and and I think
 
05:27:58.750 --> 05:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
like I said I think the author of this
 
05:28:04.610 --> 05:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
this bill Katie catawb would she really
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know she had a child that went
 
05:28:08.990 --> 05:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
through this and what frustrated her
 
05:28:11.930 --> 05:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
most was that he was tested and then it
 
05:28:13.610 --> 05:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
was a couple months later until they
 
05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
could get through the special ed
 
05:28:18.170 --> 05:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
services before he got some services and
 
05:28:20.330 --> 05:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
and like I said they do have the you
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
know the this is out of uh New Hampshire
 
05:28:25.550 --> 05:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there's a whole
 
05:28:28.250 --> 05:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
booklet can go to the parent to let them
 
05:28:30.530 --> 05:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
know you know some interventions and
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
also uh the teacher so
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah of course if a child is screamed is
 
05:28:41.150 --> 05:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
in his dyslexic
 
05:28:44.330 --> 05:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
does that automatically uh determine an
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
IEP for that is that is that is the IEP
 
05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
part of this new intervention not the
 
05:28:52.730 --> 05:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
screening not this you have to make a
 
05:28:54.650 --> 05:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
formal referral through special ed and
 
05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
the process starts Bingo all over again
 
05:29:00.350 --> 05:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so so once a child is determined to
 
05:29:04.128 --> 05:29:04.138 align:start position:0%
be dyslexia that then starts the whole
 
05:29:07.250 --> 05:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
intervention process or I guess I'm not
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
well it's not sure Rick what you just
 
05:29:11.330 --> 05:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
said dyslexia is not a specific
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
handicapping condition I don't believe
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
that was always our fight with Jack
 
05:29:17.530 --> 05:29:17.540 align:start position:0%
Balcom do you remember yeah
 
05:29:21.230 --> 05:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
and and so if they're seen as having
 
05:29:21.240 --> 05:29:23.208 align:start position:0%
and and so if they're seen as having
dyslexia

05:29:23.208 --> 05:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
dyslexia
 
05:29:26.570 --> 05:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
and it's determined that then the formal
 
05:29:28.550 --> 05:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
intervention starts
 
05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
and but what we're trying to say is what
 
05:29:31.850 --> 05:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
are we going to do between the time
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's done through the screening that's
 
05:29:36.050 --> 05:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
perceived that you've got dyslexia
 
05:29:39.230 --> 05:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
to the time that special ed process is
 
05:29:44.208 --> 05:29:44.218 align:start position:0%
complete that could be 60 days or easily
 
05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's that's what you're
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
saying then they do all kinds of testing
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
and they won't just test for that
 
05:29:56.590 --> 05:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.150 --> 05:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
process you would if you would
 
05:29:59.160 --> 05:30:02.288 align:start position:0%
process you would if you would
identified

05:30:02.288 --> 05:30:02.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.128 --> 05:30:04.138 align:start position:0%
at the same time you've probably
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
initiate that referral just a six day
 
05:30:07.730 --> 05:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
process you're talking about before
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
informal diagnosis there's days
 
05:30:12.170 --> 05:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
associated with every bit of that
 
05:30:14.570 --> 05:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
referral process from notifying the
 
05:30:17.330 --> 05:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
parent getting it back getting the
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
testing set up there's all dates in
 
05:30:21.050 --> 05:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
federal law for that right plus they'll
 
05:30:22.850 --> 05:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
do a hearing screen they'll do a vision
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
screening to rule all of that out to us
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
it takes a long time so I think the
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
general and intervention you're talking
 
05:30:31.730 --> 05:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
about or what classroom teachers do
 
05:30:36.128 --> 05:30:36.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.690 --> 05:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
children that have different coding
 
05:30:41.930 --> 05:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
issues similar we've grouped them in in
 
05:30:43.850 --> 05:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
that way so I think that is probably
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
what you're getting at with your general
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
integration strategies the only concern
 
05:30:49.448 --> 05:30:49.458 align:start position:0%
that I would ever get into is
 
05:30:53.170 --> 05:30:53.180 align:start position:0%
stabbing to get that done and any future
 
05:30:55.550 --> 05:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
parents some of the implies you can do
 
05:30:58.490 --> 05:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.500 --> 05:30:59.628 align:start position:0%
 
exclusive

05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
exclusive
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
helping resources are probably able to
 
05:31:05.930 --> 05:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
do this once you don't
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
and they both have reading groups anyway
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
because not all kids enter School
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
reading I mean right at the same level
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
if you've been going to preschool for
 
05:31:15.170 --> 05:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
three years you're entering differently
 
05:31:17.330 --> 05:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
than the kids coming from home watching
 
05:31:22.368 --> 05:31:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:24.288 --> 05:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
I think the other thing that she really
 
05:31:27.050 --> 05:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
wanted was the notification the the
 
05:31:29.510 --> 05:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
parent notification
 
05:31:31.128 --> 05:31:31.138 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know why that might have
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
been delayed at a school but
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
um certainly the in line 27 it's this
 
05:31:39.170 --> 05:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
the school show inform the students
 
05:31:40.730 --> 05:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
parents their legal guardian and the
 
05:31:42.530 --> 05:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
screening results
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
how possible would it be for a normal
 
05:31:47.930 --> 05:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
school system would normal numbers of
 
05:31:51.230 --> 05:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
kids that get diagnosed to have on hand
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
the books and the materials for any do
 
05:31:56.810 --> 05:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
whatever reading program that they
 
05:31:59.330 --> 05:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
decide on to just have it
 
05:32:01.610 --> 05:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
available to them to use immediately
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
well dyslexia has been you know it
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
what was it three four years ago that
 
05:32:08.690 --> 05:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
the first dyslexia bill came through
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
here and at that time it was something
 
05:32:15.650 --> 05:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
that was recognized I mean it really
 
05:32:18.288 --> 05:32:18.298 align:start position:0%
started people started recognizing the
 
05:32:20.330 --> 05:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
issue a lot more than they ever had
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
before so I would assume and it's
 
05:32:25.970 --> 05:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
terrible to assume I know but I would
 
05:32:28.430 --> 05:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
assume that if a school district had had
 
05:32:31.788 --> 05:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
one dyslexic kid come through then you
 
05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
know they probably do have those
 
05:32:35.930 --> 05:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
resources and somebody knows what to do
 
05:32:37.850 --> 05:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
well you know what I mean you would
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
think you would think yes I guess that's
 
05:32:42.170 --> 05:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
the part of assuming yeah
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's another type of training right
 
05:32:46.550 --> 05:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:55.250 --> 05:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.650 --> 05:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
um so speaking as a department member
 
05:32:59.930 --> 05:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
but also as a mom of a child who's
 
05:33:01.730 --> 05:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
actually going through this process
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:33:05.330 --> 05:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
um not all interventions work for every
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
kid so dyslexia you may have a it covers
 
05:33:13.570 --> 05:33:13.580 align:start position:0%
a pretty wide range of of a reading
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities so
 
05:33:19.730 --> 05:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
a child can have an intervention and be
 
05:33:21.470 --> 05:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
working with a reading specialist going
 
05:33:23.330 --> 05:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
through that intervention and not making
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
adequate progress they might be making
 
05:33:28.250 --> 05:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
some progress but not to where they need
 
05:33:30.050 --> 05:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
to be so then it's like okay do we look
 
05:33:30.060 --> 05:33:30.890 align:start position:0%
to be so then it's like okay do we look
at

05:33:30.890 --> 05:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
going through the special education
 
05:33:35.208 --> 05:33:35.218 align:start position:0%
identification process do we look at
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
just using a different intervention that
 
05:33:40.070 --> 05:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
might work for this student
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
the schools are a little bit
 
05:33:42.600 --> 05:33:43.368 align:start position:0%
the schools are a little bit
um

05:33:43.368 --> 05:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:46.190 --> 05:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
tied basically by the staff that they
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
have so if you have a staff member that
 
05:33:52.250 --> 05:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
knows how to give a certain intervention
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
but that person is a special education
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
teacher funded with Federal special
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
education dollars right that has to be a
 
05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
special education identified student in
 
05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
order to receive that intervention
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
so you might have a reading specialist
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
that can do another intervention that
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily
 
05:34:13.310 --> 05:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
um as might be just a reading specialist
 
05:34:15.670 --> 05:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
but she's he or she is trained in that
 
05:34:18.410 --> 05:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
they can deliver that intervention to
 
05:34:20.090 --> 05:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
that student without having to go
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
through the identification process for
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
special education so there's some
 
05:34:27.948 --> 05:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
different components okay to kind of be
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
aware of and the resources of that
 
05:34:32.690 --> 05:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
school district and who is trained so if
 
05:34:35.448 --> 05:34:35.458 align:start position:0%
I look at a child that maybe we could
 
05:34:36.410 --> 05:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
just look at doing a different
 
05:34:38.330 --> 05:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
intervention and see if progress
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't be made there and if that
 
05:34:41.448 --> 05:34:41.458 align:start position:0%
doesn't work we might need to look at
 
05:34:44.270 --> 05:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
another intervention or another program
 
05:34:46.970 --> 05:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering for a normal school
 
05:34:49.250 --> 05:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
district what are they looking at and
 
05:34:51.410 --> 05:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
how can they be prepared and what does
 
05:34:52.430 --> 05:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
it cost
 
05:34:52.440 --> 05:34:54.050 align:start position:0%
it cost
yeah

05:34:54.050 --> 05:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:34:56.650 --> 05:34:56.660 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the student yes
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
a wide variety The Language I I don't
 
05:35:01.610 --> 05:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
know if I'm really keen on the word
 
05:35:03.650 --> 05:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
intervention that place uh I think
 
05:35:06.410 --> 05:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
during this time classroom accommodation
 
05:35:09.050 --> 05:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
shall be initiated within 20
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
there have to be accommodations made uh
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
or modifications I guess either one of
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
those terms but accommodations you're
 
05:35:19.490 --> 05:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
accommodating the needs of that student
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
through your how you're teaching and how
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
that child's reading and how that
 
05:35:28.128 --> 05:35:28.138 align:start position:0%
child's learning uh in the classroom
 
05:35:30.650 --> 05:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
um we might think of some other
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
when you talk intervention the
 
05:35:35.090 --> 05:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
intervention process is one where you're
 
05:35:38.090 --> 05:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
intervening to then look at and work
 
05:35:39.410 --> 05:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
with others to try and figure out where
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
we have to go to help
 
05:35:43.368 --> 05:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
and it oftentimes end up in special
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
education process intervention could
 
05:35:47.690 --> 05:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
help end up with you're working with
 
05:35:49.850 --> 05:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
community health or you're working with
 
05:35:53.330 --> 05:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
bilingual education or or a number of
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
different Avenues maybe smaller groups
 
05:35:57.650 --> 05:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
maybe intervention might let's talk to
 
05:35:59.208 --> 05:35:59.218 align:start position:0%
the teacher you had last year and find
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
out what hearse his or her techniques
 
05:36:04.010 --> 05:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
were that were so wonderful intervention
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
teams can make a whole lot of different
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations but what you're trying
 
05:36:10.128 --> 05:36:10.138 align:start position:0%
to do is accommodate until such time
 
05:36:12.350 --> 05:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
that you can get that special education
 
05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay so you think if I
 
05:36:23.690 --> 05:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
um amend this bill to wherever it says
 
05:36:25.250 --> 05:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
intervention to you could say during
 
05:36:27.288 --> 05:36:27.298 align:start position:0%
this time classroom accommodation shall
 
05:36:31.070 --> 05:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
be initiated or or so so it's saying
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
something's got to be done okay
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
accommodation means you're tweaking
 
05:36:35.690 --> 05:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
something okay
 
05:36:38.930 --> 05:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
and and uh on
 
05:36:38.940 --> 05:36:40.850 align:start position:0%
and and uh on
um

05:36:40.850 --> 05:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
26 line 26 the intervention there is
 
05:36:43.680 --> 05:36:54.830 align:start position:0%
26 line 26 the intervention there is
okay

05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:57.430 --> 05:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
I would think you would want it to be an
 
05:37:01.070 --> 05:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading intervention okay
 
05:37:04.150 --> 05:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:06.050 --> 05:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
supplementary is fine supplementary
 
05:37:07.788 --> 05:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading instruction
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
intervention you would want it to be
 
05:37:15.288 --> 05:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
26 I was looking at 26 yeah
 
05:37:17.948 --> 05:37:17.958 align:start position:0%
you would want that to be
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
I would yeah I would think you'd want to
 
05:37:22.368 --> 05:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
take out all that
 
05:37:24.650 --> 05:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
um modified differentiated or
 
05:37:24.660 --> 05:37:26.030 align:start position:0%
um modified differentiated or
supplemental

05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
take that out is that what you're taking
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
out oh no I'm just I would agree that
 
05:37:30.890 --> 05:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
you would want to have the
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
evidence-based reading instruction
 
05:37:33.890 --> 05:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
intervention you don't want to
 
05:37:35.208 --> 05:37:35.218 align:start position:0%
modificate you don't want an
 
05:37:37.368 --> 05:37:37.378 align:start position:0%
accommodation you don't want to so leave
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
the intervention there yeah thanks
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right yes
 
05:37:45.470 --> 05:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
I want my kid to have an intervention
 
05:37:48.050 --> 05:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
with an evidence-based program I don't
 
05:37:51.890 --> 05:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
want her to be accommodated or I she
 
05:37:54.170 --> 05:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
should be getting an intervention even
 
05:37:55.310 --> 05:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
while she's waiting through the special
 
05:37:57.288 --> 05:37:57.298 align:start position:0%
for the special education process to go
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
through she should continue to receive
 
05:38:01.368 --> 05:38:01.378 align:start position:0%
that episode space intervention by I
 
05:38:04.550 --> 05:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
would think of special yeah I totally
 
05:38:04.560 --> 05:38:09.530 align:start position:0%
would think of special yeah I totally
understand

05:38:09.530 --> 05:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.490 --> 05:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I did notice in comparing 377 and
 
05:38:13.500 --> 05:38:15.670 align:start position:0%
and I did notice in comparing 377 and
437

05:38:15.670 --> 05:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
437
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
there's some timelines where they
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
conflict one will say 30 days one says
 
05:38:24.890 --> 05:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
60 days one
 
05:38:26.810 --> 05:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
um says reading intervention is
 
05:38:26.820 --> 05:38:28.910 align:start position:0%
um says reading intervention is
immediately

05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
05:38:28.920 --> 05:38:29.570 align:start position:0%
immediately
um

05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
given versus I think one of them says 21
 
05:38:35.930 --> 05:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
days so we might just just something to
 
05:38:39.410 --> 05:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:45.230 --> 05:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
because they both passed the new one be
 
05:38:53.208 --> 05:38:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:57.770 --> 05:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
so we Goodwood 377 sort of yeah do you
 
05:38:59.868 --> 05:38:59.878 align:start position:0%
want me to make that to to send over for
 
05:39:01.730 --> 05:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
an amendment well I think you yeah we
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
can we'll get closer and closer and
 
05:39:05.390 --> 05:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
closer and we'll be there okay good um
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important what about
 
05:39:10.368 --> 05:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
this 437 now
 
05:39:11.690 --> 05:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
we have about
 
05:39:16.490 --> 05:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:20.030 --> 05:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
we have do you have Cornelius Amendment
 
05:39:23.690 --> 05:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
is it all three two two uh oh four eight
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.240 --> 05:39:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:39:39.410 --> 05:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.970 --> 05:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to go get copies of it
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
but this one we have to get done so I'm
 
05:39:46.550 --> 05:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
just I'm just going to look at that I
 
05:39:52.250 --> 05:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:53.650 --> 05:39:53.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.120 --> 05:40:18.128 align:start position:0%
 
seventh

05:40:18.128 --> 05:40:18.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:21.288 --> 05:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
four three seven it no we retained that
 
05:40:21.298 --> 05:40:24.590 align:start position:0%
four three seven it no we retained that
bill

05:40:24.590 --> 05:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.868 --> 05:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.690 --> 05:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:43.010 --> 05:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think they were just put on here
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
because of very similar
 
05:40:47.690 --> 05:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do that no we don't
 
05:40:49.550 --> 05:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
have to do it today
 
05:40:56.208 --> 05:40:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's a fatigue oh yeah I think it's just
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.760 --> 05:41:06.288 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:41:06.288 --> 05:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
so there's that's it for today right now
 
05:41:15.410 --> 05:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:17.330 --> 05:41:17.340 align:start position:0%

05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%

05:41:36.550 --> 05:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
person no we can go watch it
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%

they're very unrepresented in those
programs

05:41:58.610 --> 05:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
