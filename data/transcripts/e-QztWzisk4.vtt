today we've got a packed lineup we're
 
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
going to start by resuming the public
 
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 609
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
We Will Follow That by resuming the
 
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 142.
 
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of both of those
 
00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
meetings we will be
 
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
holding an executive session on five
 
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.830 align:start position:0%
holding an executive session on five
bills

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
that are listed in the calendar
 
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
including House Bill 609 and House Bill
 
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
142. those are the these five bills are
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
the final five bills that this committee
 
00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
has to
 
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
come to a resolution about
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
before the house deadline
 
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
before the house deadline
for

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
deliberating on bills arrives
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we hope to get all that work done
 
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
today we'll stay as long as needed
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
if it's necessary we will take a lunch
 
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
break and then come back after lunch
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to reopen the
 
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 609.
 
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
and now let's go over the ground rules
 
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
for how we're going to hold this resumed
 
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
we have over a dozen pink cards
 
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 align:start position:0%
that have been submitted so I will be
 
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
that have been submitted so I will be
consistently

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
requesting that everybody limit their
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
testimony to three minutes
 
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I will enforce that three-minute
 
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.230 align:start position:0%
and I will enforce that three-minute
limit

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
I also request that you only present
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
information to the committee that we
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
have not already heard
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
please don't repeat stuff that we heard
 
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
if you were here last Monday
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
if you weren't here last Monday you
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
probably don't know what was said so you
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
may end up repeating yourself but I will
 
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
give you a heads up if I think that
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
so with those ground rules in place we
 
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
can now start the public hearing
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I will call first on the honorable
 
00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk to give us his perspective on
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation and before rep
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
the former representative Kirk begins
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
his testimony I want to point out that
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
there is an extensive Amendment
 
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
under preparation at the office of
 
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
legislative Services even as we speak
 
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
and this extensive
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
amendment makes numerous changes
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
as presented or as introduced and also
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
makes numerous changes to the amendment
 
00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
that I discussed at the initial public
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
hearing for this bill
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
some of the big changes that have been
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
made include the addition of two public
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
members to the Public Utilities
 
00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
members to the Public Utilities
Commission

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.170 align:start position:0%
Commission
process

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
the change in application fees
 
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
and other changes
 
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
that were necessary to support the two
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
changes that I just missed mentioned so
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
there are extensive changes coming on
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.150 align:start position:0%
the bill
and

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that those changes will lead
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
to some bipartisan support so that we
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
can move this bill forward
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll now look forward to
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
hearing the comments of our esteemed
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
former colleague
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
Kirk it's all yours Neil nice to see you
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
by the way same here Mr chairman good
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
morning to you sir and to members of the
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Neil Kirk I
 
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
live in Ware and I'm representing myself
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's good to see so many of you back and
 
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
with respect to this bill it contains
 
00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
The Good The Bad and The Ugly
 
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
the good is that it attempts to
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
rationalize and shorten a process of
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
approving energy
 
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.029 align:start position:0%
approving energy
um

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
developments which currently takes far
 
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 align:start position:0%
far too long we can't spend years
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
approving these kinds of things it needs
 
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
to be done quickly and this bill is a
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
really good start in speeding up the
 
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.189 align:start position:0%
really good start in speeding up the
process

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
if you can do anything to speed it up
 
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
even further kudos to you
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
the bad
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
puts in Char it puts the Public
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission in charge of making
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
decisions for which it cannot
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
institutionally do a good job and that
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
is considering the public interest in a
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
way that the SEC has done
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
this in effect abolishes the SEC
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
and lets the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
do that work
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
there are a whole variety of ways that
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
it does this but that's the essence and
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that you've got
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
a A administrative institution the puc
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
whose job is to improve power and make
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
power available making decisions in an
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
area which would say no we can't do it
 
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:42.740 align:start position:0%
and that's wrong
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
consolidating power in administrative
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
agency is something that you expect in a
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
planned economy
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
this needs to be divided up and the puc
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
function retained by an independent body
 
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
but that can be done under the
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the puc if it's all
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
coordinated and there's a timeline
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
the ugly
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
there is a strong suspicion amongst a
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
the Northern Pass folk and I was one of
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
those who opposed northern pass that
 
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:12.500 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
backdoor effort to get Northern Pass in
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
through a change that in effect
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
eliminates the power of the SEC
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's a suspicion that's a fear
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
but just so you know it's real
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
the good I encourage you to continue and
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
strengthen the bad you've got to figure
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
out some way to get the public making a
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
decision that's not being made by the
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
puc Commissioners they are not the right
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
body to make that decision and the bad
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
well we'll see what happens Mr chairman
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
I would hope the committee retains this
 
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.449 align:start position:0%
I would hope the committee retains this
bill

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:47.459 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
especially if this new Amendment does
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
not comply with the criteria that I've
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
suggested and work to make it better but
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
the good needs to survive this process
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
we need to speed up the way in which
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
these projects are approved thank you Mr
 
00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
these projects are approved thank you Mr
chairman

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
I'd be pleased to answer questions if
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
the committee has any thank you
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
two minutes 50 seconds appreciate you
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
staying within our
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
our guidelines any questions from the
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee that's a record for me Mr
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
not too much of a question maybe an
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
answer to one was raised I can assure
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
you that there is no uh back door Secret
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
Squirrel whatever you want to call it
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
attempted getting uh Northern Pass
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
approved via the change to the site
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee it's uh we've had
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
hearings on this we had commission
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
hearings that is not the position that
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
is not the op this is not what we're
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish we're trying to
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
make the process work better not nothing
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
to do with Northern Pass
 
00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:50.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr representative Harrington I
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
my question so if I may ask then
 
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
my question so if I may ask then
your

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
what is your
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
opinion on
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
what took so long to make a previous
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
decision in in the process and how do we
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
avoid that again
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I think the
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
timelines were too generous number one
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be better if a lot
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
of the necessary
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
parts to the approval process didn't
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
happen in sequential order but happened
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with the puc the last to
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
make the final decision but each of the
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
components the environmental the SEC
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
type has to occur simultaneously and
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
see no further questions from the
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you for being
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
coming in today next we'll call on Mr
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
who is from Stoddard and is representing
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
himself Mr Ward I'm going to use the
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
word snooker it does not refer to the
 
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.269 align:start position:0%
word snooker it does not refer to the
game

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
um first thing I want to be sure you
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
understand that this 609 is a
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
replacement for 162h which has been
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
around for a long time and we're here
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
today because the site evaluation
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
committee and the Public Utilities
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
Commission and I have to say I don't
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
distinguish between them because the
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
members have moved they've interfered
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
they've moved from one to another
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
they've moved their jobs and things so
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
when I say SEC and puc as far as I'm
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
concerned and as far as what we could
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
see over 14 years of dealing with them
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
we can't distinguish between them I'm
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
sure there's a difference
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay we were snookered like that's the
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
we worked with them
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
we tried everything
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
and they snook at us we turn to the your
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
chairman in hoping that he could do
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
something and he certainly volunteered
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
and worked hard but then it ended up
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
that they snuck at him too
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we're all sitting here and I think
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
most of us if you ask us what the
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
problem is it was they didn't deal with
 
00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:28.910 align:start position:0%
problem is it was they didn't deal with
us

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
we could say things I could disagree
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
totally with this guy over here
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
no questions asked
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's a Japanese word for it called
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
moku satsu and it translates as ignore
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
them and they'll go away and that's what
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
they did over the entire time they never
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
did for example some obvious things and
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'll just mention two of them which have
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we complained
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
about I think it was a group in around
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
and from New Hampshire was the noise at
 
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
night from the turbans
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
now it has to be according to law less
 
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
than 40 decibels
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you what 40 decibels is but
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
it's pretty loud
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
now in order to do that you have to
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
measure the damn thing
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
more than that since the The Sounds vary
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
all over the place from very light to
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
very strong
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
you have to watch what the weather is
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
doing because the weather determines the
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
sound and everybody knows including and
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
from wind and including the SEC and the
 
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.850 align:start position:0%
from wind and including the SEC and the
puc

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
puc
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
that this you need strong winds to make
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
the noise at the turbine and then you
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
need to put a cap on it it's a
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
meteorological it's a weather cap such
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
that you trap the noise then
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that that will produce
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
the loudest sound
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
so any logical
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
expression any group that was going to
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
come in and say we never go above 40 DB
 
00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
at night would have to make the
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
measurements on those nights
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
you have to know what the hell those
 
00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:16.699 align:start position:0%
nights are
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
asked I asked and I asked
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
and the Not only did the Antrim win not
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
make the measurements
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
but that they were never required by the
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
SEC puc the measurements have not ever
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
been made which would show whether they
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
did or didn't violate the law the noise
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
rule the second thing if you all you got
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
to do is go buy them the red flashing
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
lights are on half the time
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many planes over there
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to have a system
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
and from wind isn't going to put the
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
system in but you would think that you
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
would have the SEC puc where we keep
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
breaking them in and they you wonder why
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's so much time spent because we're
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
in court half the time
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
that's a problem so I can complain and
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
tell you all the things that they didn't
 
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.150 align:start position:0%
tell you all the things that they didn't
do

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
but the problem is that the the public
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
people the SEC puc never ask them to do
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
what any clown would know enough to do
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
we come away I think if you talk to the
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
people here I don't want to say I'm
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
speaking for a little bit I think I am
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
the frustration was that we could never
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
get an answer they never asked the
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
question they never did the things that
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
they had to do
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
and they didn't and that's the problem
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
with this and you need to turn down 609
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
just because it doesn't do anything
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
about that 30 seconds please pardon
 
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
30 seconds please
 
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.069 align:start position:0%
30 seconds please
okay

00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
oh 30 seconds
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
I'm one one last sentence
 
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:03.020 align:start position:0%
if you let a bankrupt come into a bank
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
you don't hand them the key and that's
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
what's going on with 609 thank you
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for your
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning and I'll call
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
next on Mr Timothy Duggan
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
of Thornton New Hampshire to give us his
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Tim Duggan I
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
live in Thornton New Hampshire
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
I spent 15 years in the United States
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
military in service to my country and my
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
state I was a cold warrior I spent most
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
of my time training to fight the Soviet
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
Union wherever they threatened our
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
democracy and our way of life
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
if the Soviets had gotten their way we'd
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
all be living under their system where
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
the state makes all the decisions and
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
the citizens are forced to comply with
 
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.510 align:start position:0%
the citizens are forced to comply with
them

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
I was here Tuesday there's more than 10
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
different speakers explained why
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
citizens like me should give up our
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
stake in the decisions that impact our
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
homes in our lives I heard over and over
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
that these decisions be better made by
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
the state because it would be more
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
efficient and more professional when two
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
political appointees in Concord make
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
these decisions for us
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm also a 10-year veteran of another
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
fight the battle of the northern pass
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
of the many lessons I learned in that
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
fight one seems particularly relevant
 
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.330 align:start position:0%
fight one seems particularly relevant
today

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
it always starts with a lie
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's tough to pinpoint the actual first
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass lie there were so many of
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
them I'll pick one
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
we need it to keep the lights on
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
they used to tell us that lie while they
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
showed us pictures of babies and
 
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.710 align:start position:0%
showed us pictures of babies and
incubators

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
incubators
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
well we haven't had the northern pass
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
for 13 years
 
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
the lights are still on
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
those babies in the incubators are
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go to high school
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
could I interrupt you just a second for
 
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:02.900 align:start position:0%
just a second could you not
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
re-litigate the Northern Pass issue
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
since it's already been settled and just
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
give us new information about hb609 I
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it thank you
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
so now it's starting again
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
it always starts with a lie
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
today there are two lies the first lies
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
what's known in propaganda as the big
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
lie a big lie is something is so
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive that people can't
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
imagine someone would actually lie about
 
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:29.810 align:start position:0%
imagine someone would actually lie about
it

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
eventually big lies are accepted as
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
truths because they've been repeated so
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
often people just treat them as fact
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
the big lie here is that the SEC is the
 
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.169 align:start position:0%
the big lie here is that the SEC is the
problem

00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
over and over we hear that the SEC is
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
the problem the SEC wasn't the reason
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
the Northern Pass founded for 10 years
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
those delays were caused by an
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
incomplete project plan riddled with
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental flaws that were not
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
addressed in the permitting process
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
those ambiguities and flaws festered for
 
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
years from the SEC with its public
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
component acted relatively quickly to
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
produce its ruling the SEC was the one
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
part of the process that actually worked
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
and hb609 will do away with it in the
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
name of efficiency and professionalism
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
the SEC may not be perfect but it
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely is not the problem in fact
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
for Northern press the SEC was the
 
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.390 align:start position:0%
for Northern press the SEC was the
solution

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
the second lies was formerly known as
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
paltering which is the active use of
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
selected truthful statements in order to
 
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.230 align:start position:0%
selected truthful statements in order to
mislead

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
mislead
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
when confronted with the fact that the
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
public will lose its decision-making
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
power proponents of hb609 repeat the
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
Mantra that all of the public input has
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
been retained
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
telling us that we still have input when
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the actual decision
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
is a lie
 
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
the irony of the public potentially
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
losing our stake in these decisions
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
isn't lost on me after all those years
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
spent trained to fight the forces that
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
threaten my way of life I actually find
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
myself doing it right here in Concord
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote in expedient to
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
legislate on this bill to preserve the
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
public stake and the decisions that
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
impact our homes and our lives
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time happy to take
 
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time happy to take
questions

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that uh testimony
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.450 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
um so just to make sure that I
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying that we need to
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
retain some members of the public on the
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
actual voting decision-making body for
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
you to feel confident that the public
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
has real input into the process
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's under preparation
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
does exactly that
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
further questions for the committee
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
coming in today thank you I'll call next
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
upon and I'm going to apologize in
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
advance because I'm sure I'm going to
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
mispronounce this but
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
it looks like Darlene King Jennings
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
did I get it right or not you got it no
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
and welcome
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
three minutes please thank you
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
um I am going to try to revise my
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
statements I'm not a public speaker and
 
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
I had my whole thing all set up to
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
um before this uh Amendment which we
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how many people in in
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
the public are going to get put back on
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and I am going to say that I was an
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
opposition of the northern path by the
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
way my name is Darlene King Jennings I'm
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
from Campton and I want to reiterate
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
what Mr Dugan said from Thornton the
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass is relevant to this
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
because the bottom line is this we got
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
two major lies in the beginning process
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
of this and we're getting the same lives
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
the the except for that they've been
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
revised enough so that it their today's
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
lies the lies back then were we need
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
jobs we need power
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
we didn't need power back then because
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
the power we made more than power than
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
what we needed
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
we did we needed
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
not jobs that were power company jobs we
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
needed real jobs that would stay in New
 
00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:23.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so now you guys are are
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
presenting this
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
um as we need cheaper power well the puc
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
was the one that just put in
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
a huge increase in our power
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
you know that timing is amazing
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's amazing and you want to put them in
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
charge of this
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
the second lie is that that power is
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
needed for the good paying jobs to come
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire which is a take off
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
on we needed the power we needed the
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
jobs that the power company was going to
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
bring in to us
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
so it's still the same ball of wax
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're just trying to con us into
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
believing that we
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
we you don't need our vote and that the
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
the the people who sat on the committee
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
were not educated enough
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
to know what they were doing and all the
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
other organizations didn't have the
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
funding to be able to to give enough
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
time to make it very inefficient so why
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
aren't you looking at making it
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
efficient instead of getting rid of the
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
people's voice 30 seconds please I'm I'm
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
done thank you
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
she'll tell us where she's from maybe
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's Easton
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Susan Ford I'm sorry
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
and for the record my name is Sue Ford
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
and I live in
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
a small town north of Franconia notch
 
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:15.260 align:start position:0%
you need that closer for you thank you
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
as a former representative I know many
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
of you on the committee but I'm here
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
before you today with my new title
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
a member of the public
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
I can assure you that that title isn't
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
isn't welcome since hb609 and its
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment sets out to eliminate my voice
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
I was concerned about the hearing last
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
Monday supporters of hb609 were allowed
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
to speak and take all the time they
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
wanted when we were on the second hour
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
there was a question if the opponents of
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
this bill would be given an adequate
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
amount of time to respond this is just
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
another indication that the public is
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
losing its voice when I was in the house
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
I took my responses and act and actions
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
to support and help my constituents
 
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
to support and help my constituents
seriously

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
a year from now there may be a sighting
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
project in your town what answer will
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
you give when a constituent asks about
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
the process to be appointed to the
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
Review Committee
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
oh we don't do that operate that way
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
anymore I voted against meaningful
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
participation of the public
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind you all that ship
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
has sailed the public wants and requires
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
us to involve them so that they have a
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
meaningful say in the community and I
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
like to add I don't think you need to be
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
a legislator to know the difference
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
between May and shell
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
I know we all skated around the topic
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
last week and everyone talked about that
 
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
project much too long the reality is
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
that the northern project past project
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
did take a long time agreeing on the
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
rules took a long time but those rules
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
are in place now I suspect that now that
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
we've completed the process they may
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
need some revision I haven't looked at
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
the rules for several years but there
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
also may be some adjustments for smaller
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
projects but the foundation is there
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
has it been mentioned that there was a
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
change in the path of the northern pass
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
project and had to be adjusted then
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
there were the changes for the 60 miles
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
of burial
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
not to mention that there were over 30
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
towns involved
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
of course it took a long time to go
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
through that process
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any project except
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
maybe rural electrification that
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
involved as many New Hampshire towns
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
I find it outrageous that you are
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
promoting that this SEC currently with
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
nine members represented in important
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
areas and now allowing the puc with
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
three members with a quorum of two to
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
make citing decisions even the council
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
for the public is optional and the New
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire agencies would be reduced to
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
voluntary consultative status
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
we deserve better and I believe you will
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
hear that from members of the public
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
across the state this issue has already
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
been reported in our free newspapers
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
that was not initiated by me I believe
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reporters picked up the issue
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Bulletin
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
I urge you to to recommend itl or
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you questions from the
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
committee representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here honorable
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
Ford it's always good to see you a point
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
of clarification
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
um do you see gas pipe projects being
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
rammed through in New Hampshire as a
 
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
result of passing this bill that's
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
another option of course okay if the
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
public does not have a view in this I
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
mean I'm seriously believed that ship
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
has sailed the public needs to have
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
of boys
 
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
and welcome
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
could you please tell me uh
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
do you think it's a concern for the
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and for us our
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
election body the fact that we're gonna
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
I understand there's Amendment on this
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
bill that will come before the executive
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee and without any public
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
testimony whatsoever will be voted on
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
that is concerning to every single
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
person in this room I hope
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Doug
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.020 align:start position:0%
in relation to the pre to the previous
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative's question are you aware
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
that the rules uh prevent us from
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
discussing amendments during uh public
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
hearing of the basic Bill until
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
executive session opens and a motion is
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
made on the basic Bill and only then can
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussions be made on the amendment yes
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
I do that do know that but I served on
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and I will tell
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
you right now that whenever we had a
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
bill come before us in one of that fit
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
either house as committee one two or
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
three we discuss those amendments we
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
tore them up and down one side and the
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
other so that we could make sure that we
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
were doing what was right for the public
 
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
if you want to stay this afternoon and
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
have an or next week and have an
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
amendment discussion and a hearing on
 
00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'll be glad to look it
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
over and come back
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
follow up so you agree that we have to
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
open up the exact session first before
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
we can discuss the amendment which has
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
no limit for discussions
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
you can do you want what you want I've
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
read the amendment I didn't see that
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
much change
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
just so you know and I'm not I'm not
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
convinced that everybody has read the
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
Oregon has a question thank you very
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
much Mary Mr chair
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
um you may and may not be aware of this
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
so I may just have to ask whether you
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
believe it but would you are you aware
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
that in my community we had
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
a somewhat smaller project but still
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
controversial uh the well we nicknamed
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
it the southern pass but the Seacoast
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
reliability project which ran from
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
Madbury to Newington and uh would you
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
believe that in fact the SEC did a very
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
thorough you know digital uh routine uh
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
did a very thorough review of the
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
project had many many hearings and
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
information sessions and in fact in that
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
case they actually did approve the
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
project with some changes and actually
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
did get built so thank you
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
representative I do remember that
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
project and I remember it was going on
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
at the same time as Northern Pass was
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
going on and we all watched it for the
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
expediency and the work that they put
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has another
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair actually
 
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
this is a point of clarification
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
um representative Douglas Thomas just
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
reminded us that we have to open up the
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
amendment in exec in an executive
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
session before we can discuss it however
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
we've already heard from the chair who
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor of this uh Bill details
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment so do we either
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
what is what is what is the course of
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
action do we discuss the amendment or do
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
we not discuss the amendment thank you I
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
had a long discussion with the house
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
clerk about this issue
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
and he said that you can talk in general
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
terms about an amendment you can't talk
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
about the specific language of the
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
amendment until executive session
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and is the amendment available for
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
the public to read at this point
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
it will be very shortly I'm waiting for
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
OLS to complete the final changes that
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
were made
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had a weekend that
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
intervened which slowed down the process
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
a little bit but hopefully those changes
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
will be available within an hour
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we also know that the public
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
has no voice as your executive sessions
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's the way the process I do know
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
that I said I'm sure you're well aware
 
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:27.140 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for The Honorable
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
Ms Ford
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you thank
 
00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:33.950 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you thank
you

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Breslin three minutes
 
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Breslin three minutes
please

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Ray president Donald
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
Londonderry and I'm not a public speaker
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
um what we're discussing here is
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
extremely important and
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
um there's a really big picture
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about energy
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
um with a lot of sources of energy
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
and we need to look at all of them
 
00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.010 align:start position:0%
and we need to look at all of them
um

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into a northern
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
pass because
 
00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:17.450 align:start position:0%
pass because
um

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know as much about it as a
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps I should but
 
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.909 align:start position:0%
perhaps I should but
um

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
what we have here is a situation where
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
we export energy out of state okay
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
if we used all the energy we made in the
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we'd have plenty
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
of energy but yet we're being told
 
00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:39.290 align:start position:0%
of energy but yet we're being told
um

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.970 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
eversource comes to the state of New
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and tells us that we're going
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
to have rolling blackouts
 
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:53.540 align:start position:0%
because there's a shortage of energy
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's of concern and when we have power
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
plants down to Newington and Portsmouth
 
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
that are in a situation of basically
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
from what I see uh sort of like
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
mothballs I could be wrong but when I go
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
down there and take a look I don't see
 
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
any activity whatsoever
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
and are those plants to sitting there
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
now wait a minute some of those plants
 
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh Pico plants
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
that uh when is of New England calls up
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
and says we need some more power here
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
and fire up your plant
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
well those plants have to be ready to go
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
at a moment's notice
 
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:38.660 align:start position:0%
uh they can't be uh just sitting there
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
cold uh takes a long time to bring a
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
turban or a boiler up to temperature so
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
you can put it online
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's not peaking power yet some of
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
these plants are being paid as
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
um spinning Reserve peaking uh which
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
means they need to need to be available
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
at a moment's notice
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
if we got plants sitting here in New
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not being used
 
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not being used
properly

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh we've got some concerns
 
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.089 align:start position:0%
uh we've got some concerns
look

00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
production of power it is a lot of
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
things we can have wind we can have
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
hydro we can have fossil fuel plants we
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
can have wood chip plants which
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
unfortunately wood chip plants in New
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire apparently are found to be not
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
useful uh not uh economically feasible
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
30 seconds please
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
um we have School departments in the
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that have wood
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
chip plants we have uh schools and
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings in the state of New
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
I have uh
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
have wood pellet plants those folks have
 
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
done their studies and they find that
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
those who are economically feasible to
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
produce heat for the buildings for
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
schools and municipalities uh by the way
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
um okay Mr Breslin you're starting to
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
stray from this topic and you've reached
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
your time limit so I want to thank you
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
for for being here and ask you to wrap
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
up in the next uh 10 seconds please okay
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh if the point is this uh this this is
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
a very important subject I agree we need
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
to really look at this
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
um but we need to know
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
um we need to have the the public

please turn on the microphone
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
as a young freshman legislator
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
as it happened I was a few months before
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
that I was sitting
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
in front of the Plymouth State College
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
Union building with a fellow I just met
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
named Michael Hutchings
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
and another fellow that you may know
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
some of you anyway named Ray Burton
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
walked up to me
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
and Michael
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
and he handed us each a dollar
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
and he said you go register to run for
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
the legislature Ray didn't know what our
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
party was
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
as it turned out Michael was a
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
Republican and I was a Democrat
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
but we were both sedan broke that
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
Michael used to joke that I could make a
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
chicken go seven days
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm still pretty good at that by the way
 
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.370 align:start position:0%
I'm still pretty good at that by the way
um

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:03.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
anyway Michael and I we were we were
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
because we were broke we carpooled to
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
Concord together
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
and we learn to talk to each other
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
which is something that is badly needed
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
right now between the Democrats and the
 
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.190 align:start position:0%
right now between the Democrats and the
Republicans

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
he became
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
my best friend to this day
 
00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.970 align:start position:0%
my best friend to this day
uh

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
and we talked about everything and we
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
used to come down to the legislature and
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
we used to work our committee I was on
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
this committee on Edna and we were
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
reorganizing state government at the
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
time under the current Governor's father
 
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.930 align:start position:0%
time under the current Governor's father
and

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:46.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
Ray Burton when he gave us that dollar
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
he said I'm not ever going to ask you
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
how I'm not ever going to tell you how
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
you should vote what I am going to tell
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
you is do not let the legislative
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm here
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill not only for me but
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
and I I I I have to associate my remarks
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
with my fellow colleague from those days
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk and you would almost never
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
hear me saying that when we were in the
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
legislature together
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
yet Neil Kirk was probably one of the
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
most respected members of the
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
legislature by both political parties
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
when he was here 30 seconds please we
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
cannot Rob the citizens of their voice
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%

going to do that and this response is
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
the kind of response that you would
 
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
expect from president XI of China as
 
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to the president of the United
 
00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.210 align:start position:0%
opposed to the president of the United
States

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Mark
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
Sanborn assistant commissioner New
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
Services I spoke last Monday so I won't
 
00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.890 align:start position:0%
Services I spoke last Monday so I won't
repeat

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I just I'll be very brief
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
um I do feel compelled to say based on
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
some things that have been said today no
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
agency in the state is giving up any
 
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.260 align:start position:0%
Authority Under This
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
the if there is a permit or approval
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
required through another part of the
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
state this bill keeps that intact
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
anything that has to go through the New
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
Services will still have to go through
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
so statements to the contrary or
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
statements that agencies are giving up
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
any of their Authority or
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are simply inaccurate
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
the second thing I'd like to make clear
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
is if you support renewable energy you
 
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:33.380 align:start position:0%
should support this bill
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
Legacy generators who already have an
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
investment in New Hampshire
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
have a reason to fight through the
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
ineffective SEC process they already
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
have enough invested here that they will
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
continue to work through the process
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
regardless if you are starting with zero
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
dollars of investment right now you will
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
not come here because it costs too much
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
money to get through the process so you
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
will go to another state that has a more
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
efficient And Timely
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
um citing process
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
and to to do your business so if you
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
believe New Hampshire needs more
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generation the best
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
thing you can do is improve the
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
efficiency and the timeliness and the
 
00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
cost of getting through the citing
 
00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:30.710 align:start position:0%
cost of getting through the citing
process

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
those are the two things I wanted to
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%

um can you just comment how many
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
projects are before the SEC right now
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
and how many of them are renewable
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not the admit that perhaps a
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
better question for the SEC
 
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.010 align:start position:0%
better question for the SEC
administrator

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't know for sure but I have
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
heard uh obviously speaking about
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is an extremely part
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
important part of the environmental
 
00:44:37.089 --> 00:44:37.099 align:start position:0%
conversation so in talking with many
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
developers of renewable energy and the
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
folks who support renewable energy I can
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
tell you that one of the number things
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
they come and tell you is it is too hard
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
to get through the citing process to do
 
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire one of the
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
best examples used and it's been brought
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
up a number of times today how long did
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
it take Antrim wind which in in in in
 
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
speaking of energy projects is actually
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
fairly small project to get through the
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
process it took an enormous amount of
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
time much more than was needed to
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate the pros and cons of that
 
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.270 align:start position:0%
evaluate the pros and cons of that
project

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
may I follow up follow-up so my
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's at least two
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
dozen large-scale solar projects
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
underway so I feel like if you're going
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
to make the assertion that
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
there's not projects coming you should
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
have the data to back that up thank you
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
no there yes and they're frustrated with
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
how long the process takes and the fact
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
that they can't get through the SEC
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
process in a way to actually get their
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure built inside it and one
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
other quick thing Mr chairman
 
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.290 align:start position:0%
other quick thing Mr chairman
um

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:47.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
the uh it was mentioned earlier about
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%
the lack of follow-up through the SEC in
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
terms of enforcement of the conditions
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
of certificate again this bill addresses
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
that it actually gives a staff and and
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
gives the uh adjudicative body and the
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
folks responsible for compliancy
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
um the staff and uh hopefully the
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
necessary budget to actually do that
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
work the problem is right now the SEC
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
um as currently constructed is a staff
 
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
of one
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and doesn't have any budget beyond
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
the money for just that staffer's salary
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
so there is no ability
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
for True for that individual to
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
effectively do the follow-up so again if
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
you want if you're a believer in
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
compliancy of uh for their certificates
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
that are cited in this process you again
 
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
should support this bill because it
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
gives the resources needed to do that
 
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:51.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so for
 
00:46:56.579 --> 00:46:58.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so for
clarification

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
um because because you mentioned it
 
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.410 align:start position:0%
um because because you mentioned it
um

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:02.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
how is it if it if true and I don't know
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
if it's true because we haven't heard
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
from I guess puc
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
if it's true that we have so many
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
projects that have been submitted but
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
haven't been acted upon yet
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
why have they been submitted if if
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
everyone feels the process is
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
too long and disinviting to invest in in
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
the state I'm I'm confused please yeah
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
because folks do want to do business
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the the renewable
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh energy industry does want to do this
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
we you know I don't want to get into an
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
energy conversation Mr chairman to a bit
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
30 seconds folks have to remember we are
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
on a grid we are on a 60 grid not on an
 
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:50.780 align:start position:0%
individual State grid so
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
the the con the conversation about how
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
where exporters or importers is it's
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
really about the cost to the ratepayers
 
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:05.060 align:start position:0%
for energy in the available
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh energy created in the grid not just
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
in our state so uh you you you can't
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
have an energy conversation whether it
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
be generation use or cost without first
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
starting with the fact that we're in a
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
multi-state grid so there is a lot of
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
interest in doing business here in New
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what I will say is probably
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
the reason there are over two dozen
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
applications and is because the SEC as
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
currently constructured can't meet can't
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
have Quorum and start you can't start to
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
adjudicate those applications so again
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm excited and supportive of the
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
amount of applications I want them to
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
actually be able to get through a
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
process is that allows them to be
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
reviewed and
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
um and decided on in a manner that will
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
actually lead to more energy generation
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:49:04.619 --> 00:49:06.069 align:start position:0%
in the state
foreign

00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
Brown has a question uh thank you Mr
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
chair I'd I'd like to follow up on
 
00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's comment
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
um as a retired state worker I I will
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
tell you I am proud of every day that I
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
put into work for the state of New
 
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.970 align:start position:0%
put into work for the state of New
Hampshire

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
and I am also proud of how everyone I
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
worked with how hard they worked
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on that I want to ask
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
you a specific question if the
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Des is not in
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
or he's unavailable who makes the
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
decisions at the department
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
are there questions representative Wendy
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas I'll remind you that we are here
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
to ask questions to gather information
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
not to engage in debate yeah all right
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
well well I've message received thank
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
um one of my my uh points of confusion
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
is you you just said that the the
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
process currently takes too long however
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
last week we heard that this would not
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
affect the timeline it would sort it
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
would instead quote streamline the
 
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.250 align:start position:0%
would instead quote streamline the
process

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
um how how do you square those two uh
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
statements pretty easily it's not about
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
changing the official timelines as
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
written in statute it's about changing
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of the structure and
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicive body that hears those
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
decisions the problem right now isn't
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
how long it takes for uh an applicant to
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
submit their information or how long it
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
is to review the problem is the SEC
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
can't even meet in a regular basis the
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
SEC doesn't even have the ability to
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
function I mean you know just breaking
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
this down regardless of how you feel
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
about any of these issues the SEC does
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
not function properly it can't meet
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
there are members who have never shown
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
up to a meeting
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
this the the current structure of the
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
SEC is broken that's the New Hampshire
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
Department of energy of New Hampshire
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
biggest point in this we have a process
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
that we use in terms of reviewing our
 
00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:31.579 align:start position:0%
information and and our applications
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh those associated
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
with an energy infrastructure project
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
there is no consistency and this is not
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
the fault of the administrator or the
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
chair or the vice chair who happens to
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
be my boss the um the commissioner of
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
Des it is that it is a flawly structured
 
00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:54.230 align:start position:0%
Des it is that it is a flawly structured
organization

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
so I I would submit that no matter what
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
side of the issue you are and no matter
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
what you feel about what decisions have
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
been made or not if you want to see a
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
process that is predictable and
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
functioning you there needs to be some
 
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.470 align:start position:0%
functioning you there needs to be some
reform

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
reform
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
um just um with regard to
 
00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
um just um with regard to
um

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
time and the process in general have you
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
heard of the expression measure twice
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
cut once
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
sure thank you uh can I the inference
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
there is that I do not support an
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
accurate review of the of applications
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
and that is an incorrect that was not my
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
that was not my inference no debating
 
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
please the I want an accurate review of
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
all of it is that is the business Des is
 
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:51.260 align:start position:0%
in but a predictable functioning process
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
is produces the best outcomes
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in government
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has another
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just for
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
clarification based on what you just
 
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.030 align:start position:0%
clarification based on what you just
said

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what he's saying is
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
that none of the citing decision
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
timelines are being affected but because
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
the sac cannot meet because they can't
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
seem to get a quorum that the time
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
period is going past those established
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
timelines due to the fact that they
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
can't even meet is is that but is that
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing yeah representative
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right it's the
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
functioning of it I do we are not
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
supporting the reduction in any amount
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
of review of any applications or
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
information we are we are advocating for
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
a review process that actually functions
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
because it is structured in a way that
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
it can meet it has a budget it has a
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
staff it can do follow-up compliancy and
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
it can work it has a staff that can work
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
with us back to my original point on the
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
things DS is responsible for to make
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
sure that as one of the previous
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
speakers talks about as much being done
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
concurrently as possible that requires
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
collaboration and organization and for
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
the whatever a process is done for the
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh the SEC portion of this there if
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration is happening between that
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
body and the other agencies that have a
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility it'll much more
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
effectively allow that concurrent
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
process versus a consecutive process
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for the follow-up so
 
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.910 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you for the follow-up so
would

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
if if the SEC itself was retained but
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
modified either by number of
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
participants or who should be assigned
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
to the SEC so that they were able to
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
actually meet when they needed to would
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
that be a possible solution I definitely
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
and like I said I and and you know
 
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott is always big on this
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
plus funding it and Staffing it you
 
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
nothing can happen if whatever body you
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
form doesn't have a staff and a budget
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
to do its work
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner we appreciate you
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
being here to testify oh representative
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
closure has a question
 
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair thank you
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
Sanborn uh on the public Import in this
 
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.430 align:start position:0%
Sanborn uh on the public Import in this
legislation

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
is the public going to have enough say
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
the way this legislation is to have
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
their input on projects
 
00:55:36.059 --> 00:55:37.849 align:start position:0%
their input on projects
so

00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
um here's how I'll answer that I think I
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
think public input is essential to any
 
00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:48.740 align:start position:0%
process involving the government so
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
we would not support anything that
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
eliminates the ability for the public to
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
have their voice be heard my
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
understanding is as written I think
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
there still retains a public process and
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
a public voice and again speaking
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
broadly per the uh parameters of the
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
chairman I my understanding based on
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
conversations of possible amendments is
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
it is very ways that could make that
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
even more clear and we would we would
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
certainly support any ability for the
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
public to have their voice be heard and
 
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
participate in the decision-making
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
process that does it in a way where
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
whatever you call the entity is able to
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
function is able to meet and has the
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff and budget to do its
 
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff and budget to do its
work

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
the thank you commissioner
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
I guess there are further questions
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has one
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I just want
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
some clarification because I'm
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
remembering I think it was eight years
 
00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:52.819 align:start position:0%
ago we had a bill to
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
allow less people on a certain committee
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
it might have been the SEC
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
um was it always nine members or does it
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
used to be more
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
I don't believe and I might be wrong
 
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:07.940 align:start position:0%
about this I don't believe the uh sense
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
constructed there's been a change in the
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
makeup of I don't think there's been an
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
SEC Reform Bill for at least since then
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
I believe the current makeup is the
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
makeup it's been for
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know at least you know definitely
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
recent history
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up just a quick follow-up um
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
because I I just seem to remember
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
um how hard it is to get a quorum and
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
which I could relate to having run a
 
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:39.380 align:start position:0%
club Statewide and yep
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's exactly our point the current
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
makeup and again the folks appointed
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
have other jobs this is a secondary
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
responsibility and it is it is simply
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging for the SEC
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
administrator and the chair and the vice
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
chair to be able to have a time when
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
enough of them can meet for them to even
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
start doing this their business and and
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
that is our that is our biggest concern
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
is is is it is not structured and set up
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
in a way for it to effectively do its
 
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.829 align:start position:0%
in a way for it to effectively do its
business

00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh there's a lot of
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
stuff built in New Hampshire that's not
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily an energy project I mean for
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
example I look to the former Rockingham
 
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh race track where there's this huge
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
Tuscan Village thing now I think it's
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of Acres of
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
development and they must have to get
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
all sorts of permits including Des Dot
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
and town boards and building committee
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so forth and so on do
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
any of those to the best of your
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
knowledge and something like that have a
 
00:58:48.289 --> 00:58:48.299 align:start position:0%
public member or is the public allowed
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
to give input to them but the decision
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
is made by either appointed or elected
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
officials yes the the latter
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
um all of our agencies have the ability
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
when there's enough public interest to
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing and to get input
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
from the public some of them uh require
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
a public hearing some of our as you well
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
know our air permits uh public hearing
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
is required for as part of the process
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
but the decision is made based on state
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
and federal statutes by either appointed
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
or or
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you commissioner I think

00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
clarification on some of these issues
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'll next call on Barry Draper of new
 
00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:50.990 align:start position:0%
I'll next call on Barry Draper of new
Hampton

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%

00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Barry Draper from New
 
01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:00.059 align:start position:0%
Hampton New Hampshire which has almost
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
10 miles of really nice Scenic views and
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
natural environment along the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
pemijwasset river and I just want to say
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
that I fought for eight and a half years
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent a scar running across
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
the whole state of New Hampshire and I
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
want to say that the SEC commission
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
really was a pain in the neck you are
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
absolutely right but they wanted to
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
protect the environment there was has
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
not been a single mention even from Des
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the environment we've talked money
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
money and streamlined to get that
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
development I want you to think I hope
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
many of you move to New Hampshire for
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
its natural beauty its Community the
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire want this
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
I want you to think streamlining and
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
money is not for the people I really
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
would like you to think about that and
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
table this I'm sorry about the
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
um whatever that uh the backup
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
um information that you've distributed
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people we aren't aware of
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
any of the good stuff that you've been
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
working on we should know about that
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
before you propose a bill
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
sorry about it I really would like to
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
know so I'll just leave I'll make it
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
quick because I know you've got a lot I
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of feeling for the things
 
01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:24.299 align:start position:0%
that everybody has said today Des is an
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely important enough part of this
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
but even they have no they don't have
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
enough funding they don't have enough
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
people to back up what they have what
 
01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
they're saying they're have to do they
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
can't back up what they you know they
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't they deny a permit and they can't
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
follow they don't go to any Court
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
sessions for any permits they haven't
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
got it we need to back and really think
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
about what we have here in New Hampshire
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
and save it thank you very much
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your perspective oh
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
did you have any questions I didn't mean
 
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.390 align:start position:0%
did you have any questions I didn't mean
foreign

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
next we'll ask
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
Nancy martland to come up she said she
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
wants to read a statement from Laura
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
seifo I believe that might be
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
the name
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning I hope you can
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
do this in three minutes please I'm
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
gonna try hard
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for allowing me to read
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
this statement since I already had a
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
this is from Lara sappho
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
45 Coventry Road Benton
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
is that better okay sorry Lara was the
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
Grafton County attorney during the
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass process and as such on the
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
vote of the Grafton County Commissioners
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
she represented the people of Grafton
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
County as interveners in the case
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to note that
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
we keep referring to northern pass
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
because it's the main example that we're
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
all thinking about as something that
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
took a really long time
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
so this is Lara's statement
 
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
I'm submitting testimony in opposition
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
of hb609
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
it is hard for me to Fathom why
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
legislation is proposing to dissolve the
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee a group
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted over years to ensure
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that potential energy infrastructure
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
projects are carefully evaluated with
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
the needed expertise
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee is being
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
referred to as inefficient because this
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
group has taken the needed time required
 
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
by law to hear public testimony and
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
review proposed projects this is not
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
inefficiency it is the required
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
deliberation needed to ensure our
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
communities are not negatively
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
permanently impacted by enormous energy
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects in the case of
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
northern pass the proposal presented to
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
the SEC was devastating to local
 
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
communities and New Hampshire citizens
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
for a plethora of reasons environmental
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
Financial Scenic economic historic just
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
to name a few
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
private land for miles would have been
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
impacted often without the permission of
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
the landowners The Proposal was vague
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
which accounted for some of the
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
challenges in efficiency
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
for Miles New Hampshire citizens front
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
yard this is the burial section
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
would be dug up with anything in the way
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
removed trees stonewalls septic systems
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
to make room for a permanent underground
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
concrete Corridor with significant
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
environmental issues the property
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
devaluation alone was significant and
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
devastating to the local citizens and
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
the towns and County government relying
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
the environmental impacts both
 
01:04:39.299 --> 01:04:40.549 align:start position:0%
the environmental impacts both
complicated

01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
and raised enormous concern
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
necessitating significant expertise to
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
review properly
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
there has been talk of streamlining the
 
01:04:48.839 --> 01:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
there has been talk of streamlining the
process

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
the review of unclear proposals to tear
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
up miles of New Hampshire land to build
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
permanent energy infrastructure Through
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
Rivers streams and private land cannot
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
be streamlined 30 seconds please it has
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
to be methodical and carefully reviewed
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
When the Northern Pass proposal was
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
presented for evaluation I was stunned
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
and remained stunned
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee a group of
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
diverse citizens representing many
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
segments and types of expertise cannot
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
be disbanded for three people appointed
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
by the governor and approved by the
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
executive Council the site evaluation
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
committee is vital to protect New
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you not to disband the
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%

good morning Mr chairman and committee
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Kelly
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
Weiser from Campton and I represent
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
myself and my family today in order to
 
01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:11.579 align:start position:0%
let you know how important it is for me
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
to be here today
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you that my 15 year old
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
daughter who won the New Hampshire State
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
Alpine championships in skiing recently
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
is now currently representing New
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the eastern regional
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
championships today and she's racing and
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
I was supposed to be there with her but
 
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
I've changed my plans to be here with
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
you today
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
um 12 years and one month ago I appeared
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
before the same committee when I I know
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
we're hearing it over and over again but
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
I think the point was made that Northern
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
Pass uh was proposed at that time and um
 
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
it is the I think the single uh most
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
obvious example of the inefficiencies of
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
the current uh system that exists for
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
utility sighting in New Hampshire I I
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
think we're all here for that reason
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
um that it is an incredibly inefficient
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
process and for my family it meant the
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
loss of our business Owls Nest Resort
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
and Golf Club in Camden and Thornton
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
after a very long protracted process
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
that ended really for me well I guess it
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
starts again here today but it ended
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
with me in front of the SEC in 2017
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
playing a very private recording I had
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
made of myself of one example of what it
 
01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:30.500 align:start position:0%
was like for me personally to be
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
affected by by that SEC process so now
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
you've proposed legislation that
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
purports to upgrade this process and
 
01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:41.299 align:start position:0%
your effort to do so would reduce
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
obviously with the amendment it appears
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
not completely eliminate the public
 
01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
involvement in the process and I also
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
want to just highlight that an important
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
part of that is a representative of the
 
01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:53.900 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
my family and I feel that you should be
 
01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
seeking to streamline and modernize this
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
process and I think I'm feeling more and
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
more like this you want a new
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
information today we're talking a lot
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
about how the SEC is not potentially
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
properly funded or given the time the
 
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.529 align:start position:0%
properly funded or given the time the
the

01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:12.539 --> 01:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
the
appropriate

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think dedication of people to be able
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
to do the important job but I think
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
there's also another part to this and
 
01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
it's about what is the burden on the
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
applicant what is that what is the
 
01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
application process like for the
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
applicant of these types of projects in
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire during that whole entire
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
protracted Northern past period of time
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
my husband who's an attorney who works
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
on utility citing in Vermont saw several
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
projects come and and some of which he
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
was presenting on and and representing
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
the applicants and they were presented
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
because they met all the criteria that
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
was the thoughtful criteria that was put
 
01:08:59.650 --> 01:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
in place for those projects
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
approved and and cited well Northern
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
Pass was still going on so I think that
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
um it's important that the process
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
includes the public but it all also be
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
public and I would say representative
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
Harrington asked about the testing
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
Tuscan Village project and public
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
involvement in that that's one project
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
in one town and when we're talking about
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
these large utility sighting projects
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something that
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
potentially affects the entire State of
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which isn't just the
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
people but as some people have been
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
trying to say here it's also our sense
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
of place here in New Hampshire and so a
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
robust process that includes the public
 
01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
is important for that so I would ask
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
that you uh either itl or retain this
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill for further consideration and I'll
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you have them
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and best of luck to
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
your daughter and her
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
competition this afternoon
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions I want to thank you
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
for taking the day off to come down here
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
and talk to us we appreciate your
 
01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.010 align:start position:0%
and talk to us we appreciate your
perspective

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'll next call on Nick Krakoff of the
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Krakoff three minutes
 
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.330 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Krakoff three minutes
please

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
um good morning chairman Vose and
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members my name is
 
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
Nick Krakow I'm with the conservation
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
law Foundation here in Concord
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
um I agree with chairman Vose and other
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
supporters of hb609 that improvements
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
could be made to the studying process
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
for energy facilities but due to several
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
concerns with the Bill I'm here today to
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to hb609
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
the bill takes the wrong approach for
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
three main reasons first the POC lacks
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
the expertise and competence to decide a
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
number of the issues that are relevant
 
01:10:47.169 --> 01:10:47.179 align:start position:0%
to citing decisions
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
the bill and the the HP 609 which
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
retains the current language and the law
 
01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:53.890 align:start position:0%
retains the current language and the law
um

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:53.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
makes it that in order to cite decisions
 
01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
um the SEC must decide whether
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
the um the energy facility will not have
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
an unreasonable adverse effect on
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics historic sites air and water
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
quality the natural environment and
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
public health and safety
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
now the current SEC makeup with nine
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
members from across across a wide
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
spectrum of state agencies ensures that
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
the SEC possesses the necessary
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
competence and expertise for evaluating
 
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
the impacts caused by energy facilities
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
citing but investing the puc with sole
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
authority over setting decisions as
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
would occur under hb609 is the wrong
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
approach because the puc just doesn't
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to analyze impacts to
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics historic sites air and water
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
inequality National environment Etc
 
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
um you know what we've seen in recent
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
Decisions by the puc particularly on
 
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency that you know while
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
the POC is very has a lot of expertise
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
on rate payer impacts um when it comes
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
to other issues that they might consider
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't have that expertise
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so second HP 609 would unjust highly
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
weaken the public representation and
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
setting proceedings fortunately
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
um chairman Vose has mentioned that an
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
amendment May approve that I haven't
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
seen it yet that is encouraging but we
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
shouldn't eliminate those two public
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
members of the SEC committee from
 
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
setting decisions they're very important
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
and to provide a different perspective
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
um along that same line appropriately
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
eliminates specific requirements for the
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
sighting of high pressure gas pipelines
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
that there's a requirement under the
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
current law that the SEC adopts certain
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
rules that adopt more stringent
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
requirements for high gas high pressure
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
gas pipelines we saw in the Merrimack
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
Valley Massachusetts pipeline explosion
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
from a few years ago that gas pipelines
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
have significant safety and health
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
impacts so 30 seconds reducing those
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
requirements those extra requirements
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
for gas pipelines is just a mistake and
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
would have an unacceptable health and
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
safety risk for New Hampshire residents
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion I urge the committee to
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
either Vote itl or to retain the bill to
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
do these concerns that clf has with the
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill and thank you for your time and I'm
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate you giving us
 
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
your perspective just for clarification
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
the high pressure gas line
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
information that you
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
was eliminated from RSA six the proposed
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 363 Colon D not because
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
it was determined that it's not an
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
important activity but because it's
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
already been done
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
the rules have already been written they
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
are in existing statute and the
 
01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.370 align:start position:0%
are in existing statute and the
amendment

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
has a has transitioned language in it
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
that says that existing SEC rules will
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
be enforced going forward so that that
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
issue is covered okay thank you for that
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
clarification I may address some of my
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
concerns okay questions for Mr Krakoff
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative McWilliams has a
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you chervos
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm interested in your experience
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the puc would you say that
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
an efficient body to take over what the
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
SEC needs to do in terms of being able
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
to get a quorum have meetings keep
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
things on schedule not go over 365 days
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
not really not the least um you know as
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
we saw with Energy Efficiency it took
 
01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
we saw with Energy Efficiency it took
them

01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
over a year to decide that decision so
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know there there is you know
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
compelling evidence that the puc is not
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
overly efficient in their in their
 
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.709 align:start position:0%
overly efficient in their in their
processes

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.770 align:start position:0%
follow up
what follow-up

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
what follow-up
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and further um in terms of
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
transparency with the puc my
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
understanding is that with a
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
three-member board as proposed right now
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
for the SEC the puc being the
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
three-member board of the SEC would not
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
be able to ever meet without needing the
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
public present because even if two
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
members is a quorum that means that you
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have open meeting laws you
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to publish everything
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's determined and discussed
 
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
is that true yeah my understanding is
 
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.810 align:start position:0%
is that true yeah my understanding is
that

01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know the um the exemption for the
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
right to no law requirements would apply
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know it applies to the puc and that
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
would carry over with this um with this
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
proposed Reform Bill and so those um
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
open meeting requirements would not
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
apply to the setting deliberations thank
 
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.010 align:start position:0%
apply to the setting deliberations thank
you

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Krakow for being here
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you um said that
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
weakening of the citing requirements for
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
gas pipelines as would occur under 609
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
poses an unacceptable health and safety
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
risk to New Hampshire residents could
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
you please give me some examples of
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
health safety and environmental risks
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
that might not be considered going
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
forward with this proposed change sure
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I mean I just want to you know
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
mention again that chairman Bose has
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
stated that the current gas pipeline
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
requirement rules will you know be
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
maintained I haven't seen that Amendment
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
yet so I I don't know the extent to
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
which those will be retained But to
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
um you know first off there's the major
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of gas pipelines
 
01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
um you know the increased carbon
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
emissions that come from gas pipelines
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
um but you know second
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps more importantly or not
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
not more importantly but important
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
nonetheless are there other health and
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
safety risks and you know we saw that
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
um the Columbia gas pipeline explosions
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the Merrimack Valley of
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts back in 2018 where you
 
01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
know some pipelines exploded and there
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
were houses that caught on fire and you
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
know one person died and
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
um you know set several you know met
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
many people are injured and so you know
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
there are significant health and safety
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
risks with with gas pipelines and
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know reducing the requirements for
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
those pipelines would pose an
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
unacceptable risk
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions I want to
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Krakoff and call next on
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
Lisa Lino's from Lyman New Hampshire too
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:09.980 align:start position:0%
pardon I have handouts
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't start the clock till you start
 
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:31.910 align:start position:0%
I don't start the clock till you start
speaking

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I do not I will email them if
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay now comes the hard part
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
you have to get through all your
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
testimony in three minutes please I'll
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
do my best Mr chairman members of the
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
to speak to you today my name is Lisa
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
lenos I'm a resident of the State of New
 
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've participated in at
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
least 10 separate dockets before the
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee very familiar
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
with the process I'm going to begin by
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
saying outright I went through hb609
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
both the amended version which I know
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
has not been voted on as well as
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
introduct introduced version and
 
01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:39.659 align:start position:0%
compared it to 162h at the outset the
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
bill as written has an agenda in mind
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
and you need to understand that agenda
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
there are changes in the SEC process
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
under the bill that are subtle and
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
likely to go unnoticed but they are
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
contrary to the transparent and open
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
process we share today the bill includes
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
errors and omissions creates confusion
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
as to who's in charge introduces
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
conceptual changes to the SEC process
 
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
that weaken its Effectiveness harm the
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
public and potentially create serious
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
risk for the State of New Hampshire the
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
table that is at the top of what I sent
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
out to you is my side by side with is
 
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
where I highlight all of the issues that
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
I found with the bill I guarantee you I
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
missed a bunch of them because this bill
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
is very subtle the way it changes the
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
process and people need you need a good
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer who is not biased reviewing this
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill for you before I go into some of
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
those though I was very upset when I
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
watched the hearing last week and
 
01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:39.860 align:start position:0%
listened to the the
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
justifications for why this bill is a
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
very good bill and why it should be
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
um support it and I'm going to go
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
through a couple of those because I
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
think that's more important right now if
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
you're going to vote on the basis of
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
those justifications you need to
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand the truth of what was being
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
said last week
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
first you were told
 
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.530 align:start position:0%
first you were told
um

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
that this bill is the Senate Bill 256
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
Senate report
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
committee report it is not that bill
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is if you if you look at exam
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
exhibit three of my handout
 
01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
that is a a portion of the SB 256 report
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the five member committee that included
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
three sponsors of hb609 voted to support
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
the 10 recommendations that are on the
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
last page of that handout six of those
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
10 recommendations were discarded
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
outright hb609 barely resembles the
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
result of SB 256 please understand that
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
it is not that report you were told that
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
time is money and the longer it takes
 
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
for an application to move through the
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
SEC process the higher costs for
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
consumers thoughts time may be money but
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of building Merchant
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in New England has no
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
impact on Energy prices we are a
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
deregulated state or a deregulated
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
region our utilities do not build our
 
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
own power plants and New Hampshire
 
01:21:06.649 --> 01:21:06.659 align:start position:0%
generally does not mandate long-term
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
contracts for energy projects our Energy
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
prices are market-based and set
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
competitively according to supply and
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
demand if a project costs 60 million 100
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
million or one billion dollars it is
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
completely irrelevant and is not borne
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
by the rate payers and if they do not
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
change market price you were told that
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
the public in the process will have the
 
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
same level of participation as it has
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
today that's not true and I I can I
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
highlight that in my report in my table
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I I hope to be able to talk to some
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
of those New Hampshire citing process is
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
that you were told that the New
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citing process is too onerous
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and developers are not coming to New
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire's citing process
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
is no more onerous than other states
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
with similar adversarial processes
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
exhibit one in my package shows about
 
01:21:59.450 --> 01:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
half the states in the country have
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
statewide energy siding boards just like
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
look at Connecticut Rhode Island
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont all of them there
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
are other considerations that are
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
driving developers elsewhere we have
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
limited land difficult terrain highly
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
sensitive environmental habitat concerns
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
shortened construction seasons and
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
outside of issues such as the fact that
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
the federal tax policies that supports
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
subsidies for renewable energy has been
 
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
in flux for the last eight years
 
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
you were told each people 609 will drive
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
federal dollars to the state if you look
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
at exhibit four you can see that is a
 
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
document from the White House that
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
explains what the funds that will be
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
from the infrastructure Bill be to New
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's nothing that looks
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
finally you're told that hb609 will
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
solve in New Hampshire's NIMBY problem
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't have a NIMBY
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
problem but anyway if it does it will be
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
it will be because the language of
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
hb609 does something that no citing law
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
should do
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
it places the legislature's thumb on the
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
scale of promoting the approval of
 
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
energy projects all over all other
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
issues including the environment and if
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
I only probably have only a second to
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
talk to you I want to highlight why that
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the table that I
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
handed out that first item RSA 306 D1
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
um d11 I believe
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that what that does d11
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
D1 the Preamble of the bill says adds
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
the ins inserts the tax
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
to support the construction of critical
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure be encouraged 36. in this
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
whole area a bill where it's telling you
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
how the SEC has to take care to be
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about the environment public
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
health and safety it goes in and says oh
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
but we want to encourage critical
 
01:24:07.739 --> 01:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
but we want to encourage critical
infrastructure

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
that is bias not only that it never
 
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:15.020 align:start position:0%
defines what critical infrastructure is
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
big mistake because it could be anything
 
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
do you think a win project that produces
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
thirty percent of the time is critical
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure no
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
then if you look at 11 it reasserts it
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
reasserts that point there are many
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
other issues with the bill that fall
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
just like that I encourage you to itl
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you
 
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:38.420 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for MS lenoze
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question looking through some
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the exhibits you have here on exhibit
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
one and thank you for listening out the
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
states what they do I was looking at the
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
other New England states and I noticed
 
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
that uh all of them except for Vermont
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
uses a puc to make the site decisions
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
but the rest of states in New England
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
all use a uh a distinguished site
 
01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
Council or board
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
um so and we heard from the
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services saying that it'd
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
be they'd be in favor of anything as
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
long as there was a group or Council
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
that actually would be able to get
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
together so my pertaining of this bill
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
and what I want to hear is is would it
 
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:20.219 align:start position:0%
make it better if there was actually a
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
group or Council that actually was
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
effective it could show up would have
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
funding and members to be available yes
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
I believe a professionalized group of
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
people that is dedicated but one of the
 
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
issues that the state of New Hampshire
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
is wrestled with over and over again is
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
contrary to what Mr Sanborn said they're
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
only as far as I can tell two open cases
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
before the Senate evaluation committee
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
not cousins I don't know where that
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
number came from so it's hard to keep
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
that group of people busy if it's
 
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
there's not that much in the way of
 
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
activity so that that's one of the
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
why we're using people from different
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
parts of the state to do this work
 
01:25:59.639 --> 01:26:00.890 align:start position:0%
parts of the state to do this work
follow-up

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so in that case in your estimation
 
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
how would you propose for it be able to
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
make it more efficient for a group to be
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
able to do this I don't think the issue
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
is efficiency I think the SEC process
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
works very well it could be tweaked
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's no question it could be tweaked
 
01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.310 align:start position:0%
there's no question it could be tweaked
okay

01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
um I included the I want an exhibit
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's in there that I didn't get to
 
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
talk to is Peter wrote's testimony Peter
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
wrote to his counseling for the public
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
for many years on Northern Pass Antrim
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
win and others and he addresses a
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
question of efficiency and one of the
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
biggest issues it has it was covered as
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
a recommendation in the SB 256 report is
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
that the application process is a
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
problem in the state the developers come
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
to the State SEC process and their
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
applications are not complete then they
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
refuse to answer questions on those
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
issues they change the process the
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
application in the process and it draws
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
drags this whole thing down we heard
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
some testimony about that in northern
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
pass that needs to be fixed I don't know
 
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:00.980 align:start position:0%
why there was no adjustment to it in as
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
609 but for whatever reason and that and
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
it encourages that be done that the
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
applicants as was stated for the puc in
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont be held to a standard and not
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
play around with that application thank
 
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.950 align:start position:0%
play around with that application thank
you

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
just so that we can get clarification
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
and cl and be clear on the number of
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
applications before the site evaluation
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
committee may I ask the site evaluation
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
committee administrator Mr Beamer to
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
give us a quick overview of how many
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
applications are pending before the site
 
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
and uh permits there are zero permits
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
for New Generation facilities a lot of
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
what we consider we sort of throw into
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee are ones
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
that may have been announced or once it
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
may have are trying to get support or
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
ones that are theoretical but there are
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
zero actual tangible projects before the
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
site valuation committee right now the
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
two issues that um Miss lenos accurately
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
referenced are both investigation of
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
complaints against the existing wind
 
01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:15.410 align:start position:0%
complaints against the existing wind
farms

01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
farms
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
investigations against existing wind
 
01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:23.780 align:start position:0%
farms over to the Department of energy
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I would be in charge of permitting
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
the new generation in whatever sort of
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
structure you you decide to implement
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that clarification
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
for those listening at home who may not
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
been have been able to hear Mr Beamer's
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
comments he said there are no currently
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
active permitting applications in front
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
of the SEC and two ongoing
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
certificate complaint issues before the
 
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
SEC representative McWilliams asked
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so looking at the information that
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
you provided here just
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
guide me through this are you are you
 
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation that the
 
01:29:07.930 --> 01:29:07.940 align:start position:0%
revamping of the New Hampshire SEC
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
increased the number of megawatts that
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
the threshold is for the SEC review are
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
you recommending that there shall be
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
public counsel for each applicant can
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
you just walk me through the
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations based on this do you
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
want me to go down this list your
 
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.890 align:start position:0%
want me to go down this list your
recommendations

01:29:23.890 --> 01:29:23.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
well certainly in terms of the um
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
I do strongly believe that this the
 
01:29:33.169 --> 01:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
megawatt threshold should be raised to
 
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
100 or 125 megawatts the sp256 committee
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
agreed with that voted on that as did
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
the three including the three sponsors
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
of 609 that will take off the off the
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
plate of the SEC small projects that it
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know Antrim win was 28.8 megawatts
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
it was under 30 megawatts
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
it didn't even be long before the site
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but in any event it
 
01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
was petitioned to go there
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and it took forever to do if it had
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
been handled by the local authorities
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
planning board it would have been dealt
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
with much more efficiently and it
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have wasted the state's time so
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
I I that and that I think that goes for
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
any projects Massachusetts has 100
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt threshold in terms of public
 
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.550 align:start position:0%
megawatt threshold in terms of public
counsel

01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
okay this is a very important point I
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat what other people
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
have said but Peter wrote's own words in
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
his testimony state that the only voice
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
that is representing the public but for
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
those who are who chose to intervene
 
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
themselves is Peter Roth or this public
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
counsel and he's representing the public
 
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
from a legal perspective Department of
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
energy is not take they don't have the
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
same level of obligation that a lawyer
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
from department of justice has he's not
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're not representing the public in
 
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
fact according to the bill they're
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
representing an encouraging critical
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure to be built above
 
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
and beyond everything else so I do
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that concept of the
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
public needs to be a mandated
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
view a mandated part of this process and
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and actually according to Peter
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
wrote's own testimony there is political
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
pressure on occasion very rare but it
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
has happened and he had suggested that
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
that role be put under the consumer
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
advocate office or somewhere out
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere where it may be doe as well he
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
does say that just so that they could
 
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
act independently and allow to do their
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
job without political pressure
 
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions for
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
Miss Lanos thank you very much for being
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
here oh representative Brown has a
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
question sorry I hadn't put my hand up
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
because I saw so many others up earlier
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.050 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
once again give me a little bit of
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
leeway to be idealistic here again it
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm hearing from a number of people
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
that are up here
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
that there's some kind of an insinuation
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the some evil plot coming from this
 
01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.010 align:start position:0%
that the some evil plot coming from this
committee

01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
and when you st and and
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
when you started off and and I'm asking
 
01:32:19.739 --> 01:32:20.510 align:start position:0%
when you started off and and I'm asking
you

01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
just because you're sitting there and
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it and this would apply to
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
anyone else when you first sat down you
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
said you think there's an agenda
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
and and then you move on and I'm hearing
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
this from other people tell me what that
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
you think that agenda is number one and
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
then if the chairs
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
will help me out as a freshman here for
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
any of you if you think that there's a
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
some kind of a process here where
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
someone is doing something
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
illicit or against their against their
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
oath to this legislature there is an
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee to which you can take
 
01:32:59.930 --> 01:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
that complaint
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
and and they will follow up on that with
 
01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:06.860 align:start position:0%
this legislature I I I'm I'm
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
disheartened to think that having come
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
here in my first year that everyone in
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
this room believes that people of this
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislature are against them in some way
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
so my question specifically thank you Mr
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
chair for the time what do you think the
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
agenda is here I'd like to know what
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying this agenda is that's a uh
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's coming from this I guess that you
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
meant the committee but maybe it's a
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
broader thing than that so thank you I'm
 
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
not I'm not tagging you personally you
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
understand that but I'm interested to
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
know thank you
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
I apologize in the the word the use of
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
the word agenda was not intended to
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
suggest that there was any anything
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
unethical that is happening here or that
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
anyone is acting inappropriately the
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
agenda meant that the the the bill as it
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
is structured and it's very important
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
that people see this there is an effort
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
to move not take authority away from the
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
state agencies but it moves Authority
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
significant authority to the state
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and when that happens
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
then we get into this administrative
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
World versus a public process world
 
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm if I may I'd like to give you an
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
example of where that is happening or
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
where I think it's problematic
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
um in under the bill 609 it states that
 
01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.110 align:start position:0%
um in under the bill 609 it states that
um

01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
that it's uh hold on a second that the
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
doe will administratively approve
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
changes to the facility ownership or
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
transfers of the certificate
 
01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:44.330 align:start position:0%
transfers of the certificate
administratively

01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
administratively
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
currently under RSA 162h 16 which is the
 
01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:51.020 align:start position:0%
findings part of the existing bill
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
the applicant the SEC goes to a fully
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process and then determines
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
as part of its findings whether or not
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
the applicant has the the managerial
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
Technical and financial ability to
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
construct and operate in accordance with
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
the terms of the certificate
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process now someone comes
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
in chooses to buy that facility from the
 
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
current owner
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
there is no such obligation that that
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
happened anymore
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we know that facilities their owners
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
go bankrupt AES Londonderry went
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
bankrupt we know stored solar which is
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
not affecting any certificates for the
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
that the SEC had issued but stored
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
solely that owns our biomass facilities
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt we and it is a hassle if
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
anything and we would be it would be a
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
bad situation for the state to not why
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
would we move that level of scrutiny but
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill does because it's
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
handing authority over to this to the
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
agencies the public is not involved in
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
that process anymore that's then that
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I think there are a number of other
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
similar kinds of things happening where
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
it there's attempt to puc does the
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
decision making the doe does the other
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
stuff and the other stuff is outside
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
public purview by and large and that's
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
the agenda I'm talking about and it's so
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
subtle in the way the bill is written
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's another example with regard to
 
01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.530 align:start position:0%
there's another example with regard to
um

01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
significant changes sizable changes in
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
additions to the project according to
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
the bill the way it's written and I
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
would love to be corrected on this
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
it basically says that they only have to
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
submit an application to the commission
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
and the commission need only approve it
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say they have to get a new
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
certificate for it which means that the
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
granite reliable project with 30 99
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
megawatt project and 400 foot turbines
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
can be replaced with 650 foot turbines
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
become a 300 megawatt project with a
 
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
simple majority vote in a public meeting
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
that is not appropriate and that appears
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
to be how 609 is written and that that
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
settles that subtle agenda means we're
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
taking away from the public process and
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
we're giving it to the administrative
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
process and our voices are lost in the
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
in doing so so I apologize I am not
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
pointing fingers at anyone being evil or
 
01:37:22.679 --> 01:37:24.470 align:start position:0%
pointing fingers at anyone being evil or
unethical

01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up I Just Want to Thank
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%

representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.629 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
question

01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman um if I made for
clarification

01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
um on the current Amendment uh I know we
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
don't have the revised one here back yet
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
from OLS but on the current Amendment on
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
page four
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
um line 30 actually line 28 it starts
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
off by saying that the department shall
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
administratively approve changes of
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
ownership and transfers of certificates
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
within 90 days of a petition if it
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
determines the new certificate holder
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
has adequate Financial Technical and
 
01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
managerial managerial capability to
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
assure construction and operation of the
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
facility and continuing compliance with
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions of the
 
01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
certificate can you
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
give me your interpretation of that
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
hang on Mr Blue knows what's your point
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
of order
 
01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.139 align:start position:0%
um yeah my point of order is we seem to
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
have clearly
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
gone into the area of discussing a
 
01:38:35.699 --> 01:38:37.790 align:start position:0%
gone into the area of discussing a
specific

01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
text of an amendment that we may have
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
seen and I'm just seeing on my screen
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
moments ago but certainly the witness
 
01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:46.100 align:start position:0%
who's being asked to comment on it
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it in front of her and and
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't think that's fair thank
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
you for that point of order the witness
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
brought up this issue and so it's
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
legitimate to ask her to explain what
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
under the current law 162-h it is
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
required that the the applicant or the
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
new owner go through a an adjudicative
 
01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
process which means cross-examination
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
and Expo you know presentation of all
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
the information including confidential
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
information in a non-public session that
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
be made available so it is a much more
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
open process I would argue that the SEC
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have rules I'm not sure what
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
rules they use for determining whether
 
01:39:36.490 --> 01:39:36.500 align:start position:0%
the applicant meets managerial
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
managerial Technical and financial but
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
in any event it is a public process
 
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
everyone is involved everyone is a
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say what's going on and
 
01:39:46.679 --> 01:39:47.570 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say what's going on and
in

01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
the bill at the suggestion amendment is
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
saying it's very closed door we'll just
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
sit in a room with the applicant he
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
could tell us what we think what do you
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
think show us the information and we'll
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
make it we as the doe will make a
 
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.370 align:start position:0%
make it we as the doe will make a
determination

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
I think the more public process involved
 
01:40:06.649 --> 01:40:06.659 align:start position:0%
in pressure on the applicant the more
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
likely we will get a better outcome
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think there's risk otherwise
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay representative Christian has a
 
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:16.189 align:start position:0%
okay representative Christian has a
question

01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Tara thank you Ms Lidos for
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question and for your
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
fantastic testimony
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciated that you
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
provided us with the recommendations
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
from um gosh the SB 256 commission
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
um can you speak a little bit more to
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
the items that were on there that you
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
feel were not adequately addressed in
 
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.570 align:start position:0%
feel were not adequately addressed in
hb609

01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
hb609
 
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
um the first one obviously is 609 that
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know move the adjudicative process
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
moved to the puc the second one raised
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
the statutory limit which I had
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think that's a is a very
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
important process the third one disallow
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
developer petition petitions for
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
projects less than 100 megawatts what
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
that means is that under the current law
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
and under the law is written the
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
applicant under the 609 the applicant
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
has the ability to petition the puc or
 
01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
the site sec
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
to assert jurisdiction on if it's on its
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
project even if it doesn't meet the 30
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
megawatt threshold today or what will be
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
100 megawatt threshold and what that is
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
encouraged in the past and does today is
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
um is shopping Forum Shopping if they
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
don't like what if they perceive
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
opposition within the local community
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
they go to the state and know they'll
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
get a more favorable View and review and
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
that is also mentioned in Peter Rhodes
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
testimony from 2021
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
require the puc to develop rules on how
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate the application process
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
that is key that that is right now the
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
application goes to the chair or the the
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
committee the committee can make a
 
01:41:58.609 --> 01:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
determination in non-public it really is
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
up to the the chair to do that as to
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not it meets the requirements
 
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh or or there's sufficient information
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
for it for the SEC to proceed
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
in one case that happened there was a
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
win project proposed in near Newfound
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
Lake the applicant did not have control
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
over all the land where he was going to
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
build his project particularly the
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
transmission line submitted the
 
01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:27.179 align:start position:0%
application nonetheless with no
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
certainty that he had control over that
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
land in that case the chair denied the
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
completion of the application because
 
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
that was not there and and the app can
 
01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:41.699 align:start position:0%
end up not building but Groton when the
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
applicant did not have a full
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
transmission line developed the
 
01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
application went through and it was
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
delayed the process was delayed because
 
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
of that so the application needs to
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
process needs to be improved
 
01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.490 align:start position:0%
process needs to be improved
tremendously

01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:57.500 align:start position:0%
tremendously
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's not much to say about the role
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
the administrator but for the fact that
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
under current under current
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
SEC rules or decisions
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
the there is a an order on the record
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
with the SEC that grants the
 
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
administrator full authority to make
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
decisions that are unappealable and now
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
I know this is getting into details but
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
there was a problem with that and that
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to be resolved
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't know in a sense it
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
has been discarded because under 609
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
because 609 gives
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the authorities
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
that was re-referencing too so that's
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really come out too much
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
now clarify the role of state agencies I
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
think I think they're
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think that to some extent 609 is doing
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
did someone say something
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
um continue please
 
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
I can explore the department of energy
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
investigating a certificate compliance I
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
think that's what 609 is really trained
 
01:44:09.649 --> 01:44:09.659 align:start position:0%
to do because it's gonna there is a
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
there is an ongoing issue with
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement under the site evaluation
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
committee unfortunately I don't think
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
the 609 resolves that provide rules
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
about the application process within
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
State agencies the other three uh on the
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
last one actually number nine I think is
 
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
extremely important I'm really really
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
don't know why it was not put into 609
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
and that is SEC itself has asked members
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the public when we have when we have
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
been forced to pay the fees we're
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
considerably lower than what they are
 
01:44:43.679 --> 01:44:45.229 align:start position:0%
considerably lower than what they are
today

01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
um they said unfortunately because the
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
fees are hard-coded in the statute we
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
have no authority to waive them or
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
administratively lower them on a
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis that was a
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation that be put into six or
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
whatever ultimately will be the bill and
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't so that I think no matter what
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
that should be put into the bill
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for Ms lenoze I
 
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
will next call on oh representative
 
01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.179 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
01:45:21.179 --> 01:45:22.370 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
chair

01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.330 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
you're you're pointing out the wording
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
in the bill for critical infrastructure
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
um is is interesting thank you for doing
 
01:45:30.719 --> 01:45:31.609 align:start position:0%
um is is interesting thank you for doing
that

01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
um and I also see in exhibit four you
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
gave us the infrastructure investment
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
and jobs act information on what it
 
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:41.699 align:start position:0%
covers I have also heard the the term
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
critical infants infrastructure used
 
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
with regard to this bill and what it
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
will cover
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
is one of your concerns that
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire may use some
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
of this money for some Pipelines
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
no I no it is my what I'm this money in
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
the way it's outlined towards how it
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
will be allocated in the state of New
 
01:46:08.689 --> 01:46:08.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know ultimately what
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
control the state will have over that
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
but what I was pointing out is there's
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that looks like a that
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
um generate energy generated generating
 
01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:26.699 align:start position:0%
facilities or even transmission per se
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
um so I was like if if money's if we're
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
if the site evaluation process is
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
holding up money coming into the state
 
01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:35.060 align:start position:0%
because we have a messed up SEC process
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
I don't that's not really representative
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
of the kind of kinds of things the money
 
01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:41.209 align:start position:0%
of the kind of kinds of things the money
would

01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for Ms
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
lenoza I'll next call on Lori Lerner to
 
01:46:52.609 --> 01:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
give us her perspective on this
 
01:46:52.619 --> 01:47:02.570 align:start position:0%
give us her perspective on this
legislation

01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if it's helpful I can email all
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
my documents
 
01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%

01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll point out to committee
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
members that I just forwarded you
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
email a few minutes ago
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
that provides
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
2023-0931h which I just received from
 
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
ask OLS so
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
Ms learner you know our you now are on
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
the clock and you have three minutes
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Laurie Lerner
 
01:47:54.890 --> 01:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm from Bridgewater New Hampshire and I
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
01:47:58.570 --> 01:47:58.580 align:start position:0%
this bill today I am strongly opposed to
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
hb609 I have been involved in the SEC
 
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
process since 2012. as a participant and
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
an observer of many different dockets
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through each one I
 
01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
also participated in the SEC rulemaking
 
01:48:10.619 --> 01:48:12.709 align:start position:0%
also participated in the SEC rulemaking
effort

01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
that all was around the time sb99 was
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
introduced and enacted as a Statewide
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
effort which included a significant
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
amount of public participation to fix a
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
process that had no public Trust
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
I also have participated in the hb2 and
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
SB 256 study committees chairman votes a
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
statement of nearly unanimous support
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
for hb609 could be looked at another way
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
none of the members of the public
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
supported the HB 609 approach during
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
those study committees those who
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
supported this approach were agency
 
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
staff representatives from the utilities
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
and others with a vested interest in
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
getting energy projects permitted
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
quickly and easily
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Ruth Ward's opposition to this
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill should also send a strong message
 
01:48:59.930 --> 01:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
given her role as the chair for the SEC
 
01:49:02.209 --> 01:49:02.219 align:start position:0%
reform study group
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
the problem is not with the SEC process
 
01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
aside from two unrelated intended
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
consequences which Lisa lanaus had
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned regarding the
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
SEC administrator Authority as well as
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
the cost if you have any challenge to
 
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.189 align:start position:0%
the cost if you have any challenge to
that

01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
the problem with the SEC is that it
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
consists of a panel of decision makers
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
who have little to no relevant knowledge
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
of the important subject material before
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
them the SEC committee members including
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
the puc Commissioners change frequently
 
01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
which results in no long-term
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge of the complex
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
and technical issues involved with the
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
citing and enforcement of large energy
 
01:49:39.179 --> 01:49:41.330 align:start position:0%
citing and enforcement of large energy
facilities

01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
case in point the current slate of
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
appointed puc Commissioners have the
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
following term expirations commissioner
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
Simpson July 2023 chairman goldner July
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
2025 commissioner Chata paddai July
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
2027. how will HB 609 provide any
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge benefit when
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
there's a revolving door of only three
 
01:50:01.739 --> 01:50:03.410 align:start position:0%
there's a revolving door of only three
commissioners

01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
considered decision makers on a
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
staggered six-year terms the puc
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners will barely come up to
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
speed before the term expires given
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
their lack of energy citing background
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
initially and the variety of energy
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
sources likely to require citing review
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
during their tenure
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
I would encourage all St members to read
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
the transcript from the March 9th 2022
 
01:50:27.609 --> 01:50:27.619 align:start position:0%
Antrim win docket
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
2021-02 public meeting
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
for some reason uh the meetings have
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
become public meetings instead of
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
hearings but that's another story to
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
more I'd effectively understand the
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
multitude of concerns with the puc
 
01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
taking on the SEC adjudicative effort
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the meeting was to review
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
and vote on a subcommittee
 
01:50:47.570 --> 01:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation the concerns include
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
number one a member of the public being
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
told by the SEC puc to submit written
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
comments after the meeting even though
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
the vote was occurring during the
 
01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.270 align:start position:0%
the vote was occurring during the
meeting

01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
SEC puc member who expressed lack of
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
understanding wanted to ask question on
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
testimony of a public member but was
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
told to wait until the end the SEC puc
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
chair then moved to vote before the
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
question could be asked in the interest
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
of time the SEC puc chair moved for a
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
vote without any deliberation just
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
allowing a question which did not even
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
get answered chairman Vose had attended
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
this public meeting and expressed his
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
concern and frustration with the process
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
these actions lead to frustration from
 
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
the public who are acutely aware of
 
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
complexity and consequences of their
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
ill-informed decisions in addition to
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
concerns with the puc taking the
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
adjudicative component of the SEC the
 
01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:38.699 align:start position:0%
separation of duties of the SEC between
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
doe and POC will only serve to increase
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
the level of distrust and frustration by
 
01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
the public regardless of how the
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
membership is constructed the public
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs confidence that the SEC decision
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
makers are unbiased experts in the areas
 
01:51:54.590 --> 01:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
for which they are making these critical
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
decisions that will not be the case if
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
SB if hb609 were to move forward please
 
01:52:04.129 --> 01:52:04.139 align:start position:0%
vote to itl hb609 thank you very much
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions thank
 
01:52:11.590 --> 01:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to thank you for being
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
here next I'll call on Catherine corkery
 
01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:19.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the New Hampshire Sierra Club
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair could I ask a point of
 
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
clarification certainly
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
um regarding the uh amendment that you
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
just uh delivered to us
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that the financial note is
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
still missing do you know if there's a
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
valid Financial note for this amendment
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
yet uh you could check with the house
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
clerk fine Financial notes are filed
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the house clerk so if there is one
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
Miss corkery
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
my name is Catherine corkery I'm from
 
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sierra Club and
 
01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
um we represent 15 000 people in New
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
there I appreciate all of the comments
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
so far
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
um and especially the fiscal note
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
question that was one that I had and I
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
had called the clerk's office earlier
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
asking about the procedure the schedule
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill because it was after
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
the the fast track bills that go to and
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
I they told me that there was no fiscal
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
note so
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I perhaps there will be one
 
01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:47.629 align:start position:0%
um I perhaps there will be one
with

01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
with the amendment or
 
01:53:53.209 --> 01:53:53.219 align:start position:0%
um maybe that'll be done in the Senate
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
um but that is a a big question of mine
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
because this involves
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
um every everything that we've heard
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
from the uh the different
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
um agencies is that there will be more
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
people more people to do this work and
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure where those that funding
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
will come from
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
um today I just wanted to highlight
 
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:20.810 align:start position:0%
um today I just wanted to highlight
um

01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
page six of the amended version that
 
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
um page six uh talks about the timelines
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
um and specifically uh page or line 16
 
01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
it says that within 30
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
365 days the acceptance of the
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
application the commission shall issue
 
01:54:48.729 --> 01:54:48.739 align:start position:0%
or deny
 
01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:50.699 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
it says if the commission at any time
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
while an application
 
01:54:59.450 --> 01:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
for a certificate is before it deems it
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
to be in the public interest it may
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
temporarily suspend deliberations and
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
time frames established under this
 
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
section not to exceed 90 days any
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
further suspension shall be subject to
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
the consent of the applicant
 
01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:25.639 align:start position:0%
and this all the time the
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
petitions or permits at the other
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
offices at the other agencies are going
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
on at the same time you know I think
 
01:55:35.639 --> 01:55:36.590 align:start position:0%
on at the same time you know I think
about

01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
um people spinning dishes you know like
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
we've got these dishes spinning over
 
01:55:46.129 --> 01:55:46.139 align:start position:0%
here for Des and these dishes spinning
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
over there for D.O.T crossing streets
 
01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
and what have you planning Commissions
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
in in other in the towns being affected
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and it all has to come within 365
 
01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.550 align:start position:0%
um and it all has to come within 365
days

01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
um alteration of terrain permits take a
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
long time they it and to have all of
 
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
this done at the same time
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
we did not see that and we do not see
 
01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
that as we heard from uh previous
 
01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:20.950 align:start position:0%
that as we heard from uh previous
speakers

01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
often the the application is incomplete
 
01:56:27.169 --> 01:56:27.179 align:start position:0%
or there are changes
 
01:56:30.169 --> 01:56:30.179 align:start position:0%
at while we're moving so those 30
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
seconds spinning 30 seconds please and
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
asking that this all comes to a dead
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
stop and 365 days
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
with maybe 90 more I think is a mistake
 
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're setting up expectations that will
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
not be met
 
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.229 align:start position:0%
not be met
and

01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
um given the time constraints that's
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
what I will limit myself to thank you
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate you giving us
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
your perspective
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss corkery
 
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll move on next to Karen
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Miss Payne
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
good morning you have three minutes
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you I suspect a long
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
hearing so thank you everybody who's
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
come and listened earnestly
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
um I do believe there's a corporate
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
agenda here
 
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
maybe there's not
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I would settled my mind if there was
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
an application fee for foreign power
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere around eighteen hundred
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
dollars a megawatt
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I would feel a little bit better but
 
01:57:43.729 --> 01:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
um and I was also thrilled to hear
 
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
people speak that the SEC head process
 
01:57:48.050 --> 01:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
has worked well for them
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
when I sat here last week the first time
 
01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
I heard about the SEC and how they're
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
part-time and have too many
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I thought to myself uh
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
oh that's a good point
 
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
um what about that but then now that
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
I've heard those same lines about four
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
times you could even put a actual person
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
from the SEC up here in front of the
 
01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
microphone it's I'm suspicious it's lost
 
01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
its credibility those lines have
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
filtered down from somewhere and people
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
keep repeating the same lines so at this
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
point when I hear that it makes me more
 
01:58:21.239 --> 01:58:23.209 align:start position:0%
point when I hear that it makes me more
suspicious

01:58:23.209 --> 01:58:23.219 align:start position:0%
suspicious
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
I fear that this
 
01:58:31.129 --> 01:58:31.139 align:start position:0%
um Bill what is well timed to leave this
 
01:58:35.089 --> 01:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
committee and reach our current Senate
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't deeply know how the
 
01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:41.219 align:start position:0%
legislative process works but I ask this
 
01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
committee that if this bill leaves this
 
01:58:44.099 --> 01:58:45.229 align:start position:0%
committee that if this bill leaves this
committee

01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
that it please
 
01:58:49.129 --> 01:58:49.139 align:start position:0%
um that you please take into
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
consideration all these things that we
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
who are opposed to the bill have been
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
speaking about because once it leaves
 
01:58:58.609 --> 01:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
this committee even if it leaves opposed
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
from what I understand
 
01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:01.790 align:start position:0%
from what I understand
um

01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:03.649 --> 01:59:03.659 align:start position:0%
it could it could have a different story
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
when it reaches the Senate
 
01:59:06.719 --> 01:59:07.850 align:start position:0%
when it reaches the Senate
um

01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm my background is I'm a
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
schoolteacher I spend my life teaching
 
01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
people how to think I hope I have
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
graduated a lot of free thinkers that
 
01:59:20.209 --> 01:59:20.219 align:start position:0%
will use a very strong decision-making
 
01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:21.729 align:start position:0%
will use a very strong decision-making
process

01:59:21.729 --> 01:59:21.739 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
decisions can be done short term I feel
 
01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's what 609 is doing uh yes it will
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
get corporate money from New Hampshire
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
with our dependability if it passes but
 
01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
is this not a rich process the group of
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
us together
 
01:59:40.729 --> 01:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
bringing up different ideas and perhaps
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
some we've heard some new things that
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
could be more Progressive in going
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
forward for the state
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I wish 30 seconds decision is made
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
long term and that we realize there are
 
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
things that cannot be bought once cut
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
old growth forests cannot be bought once
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
blasted Granite Vistas cannot be bought
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
our physical health our mental health
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
comes from New Hampshire sanctuaries
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
from the silent power of our Wilderness
 
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
we all know that Health cannot be bought
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you appreciate you being
 
02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
here and sharing your perspective and
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to wrap up this morning with
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
our last speaker Mr Matt Leahy from the
 
02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:24.179 align:start position:0%
forest Society Mr Leahy 32nd I mean uh
 
02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
I will do it in one minute Mr chairman
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted I know there's been
 
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of talk and I'm Matt Leahy public
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
policy director for the four Society I
 
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
did testify last week and I did hand out
 
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
written testimony just for the record
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
but I did I know there's been a lot of
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
talk that the SEC is broken and I just
 
02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:46.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out one
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
example where I just would disagree with
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
that so back in 2019 Chinook solar
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
proposed a 30 megawatt solar project out
 
02:00:59.169 --> 02:00:59.179 align:start position:0%
in Fitzwilliam
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
SEC began that process July 2019 it made
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
its approval decision in October 2020
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
yes that's more than 365 days but it's
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
you know 15 or 16 months um
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
and part of that SEC process occurred
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
during covid when all the covid
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
disruptions so
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I so yes there could be some
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
improvements made to the existing SEC
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
process but
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think there certainly are examples
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
where the SEC has
 
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
acted relatively quickly to make
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
important citing decisions on renewable
 
02:01:41.290 --> 02:01:41.300 align:start position:0%
energy especially so I just wanted to
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
make the committee aware of that
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your perspective
 
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
ah thank you chair thank you for taking
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
my question and
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really sure that you're the
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
perfect person to address this too but
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
um given
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you think that the
 
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
SEC process actually works well do you
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
think that could be an explanation for
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
why we haven't heard any testimony from
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
developers who want to develop but
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
apparently are are being stymied by this
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
process yeah that's a good question and
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
I just would say one thing the four
 
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
Society did not engage at all in that
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
solar project on Fitzwilliam I just
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have any details about
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure I can accurately
 
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
answer you know why developers you know
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
do or do not bring a project forward but
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's it is a good question and it would
 
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
be interesting to hear directly from
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
developers though
 
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
02:02:43.209 --> 02:02:43.219 align:start position:0%
to thank you for
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
giving us additional testimony
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Beamer do you would you like to say
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
something to the committee before we
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.209 --> 02:02:59.219 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a question for the
 
02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate you
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
being here I know you have uh have to
 
02:03:12.169 --> 02:03:12.179 align:start position:0%
leave because you have another
 
02:03:12.179 --> 02:03:13.609 align:start position:0%
leave because you have another
appointment

02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
so I have no more pink cards so with
 
02:03:17.689 --> 02:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to close the public
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 609
 
02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
and it is now
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
1106 I guess so 1104 1105.
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
so we will open a public hearing on or
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
resume the public hearing on House Bill
 
02:03:33.599 --> 02:03:35.270 align:start position:0%
resume the public hearing on House Bill
142.

02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
142.
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
and at the conclusion of that public
 
02:03:40.609 --> 02:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
hearing we'll take a break for lunch
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
and then when we come back from lunch
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
we'll have our executive session on the
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
five remaining bills
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
for us so can we begin our uh
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
history 142 testimony uh yes
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman thank you uh we
 
02:03:59.930 --> 02:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten the numbers on the blue
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
sheet and online for this particular
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill for 609. okay representative
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
pleasure will
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
get to work on acquiring those numbers
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
and we will report the numbers on both
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
bills at the end of the 142 public
 
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:15.290 align:start position:0%
bills at the end of the 142 public
hearing

02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.790 align:start position:0%
hearing
so

02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
first step for HP 142 is Kristen coach
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
or Koch from the business and industry
 
02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:41.109 align:start position:0%
or Koch from the business and industry
Association

02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay Miss coach says she has written
 
02:04:45.770 --> 02:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
testimony that she will submit instead
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
of testifying so
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
we'll thank her for that and move along
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
and ask Meredith Hatfield from the
 
02:04:54.649 --> 02:04:54.659 align:start position:0%
nature conservatacy to give her
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning chairman Vos Vice
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
chairman Thomas and members of the
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
committee Meredith Hatfield for the
 
02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
nature conservancy and I wanted to start
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
off by saying that I will be speaking
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
both to the original version of the bill
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
as well as to the amendment that
 
02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose brought forward
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to start by thanking
 
02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
um for bringing forward an amendment to
 
02:05:32.639 --> 02:05:33.709 align:start position:0%
um for bringing forward an amendment to
try

02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
try
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
to resolve this long-standing issue and
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
as he knows I'm quite familiar with the
 
02:05:41.290 --> 02:05:41.300 align:start position:0%
history but I thought his very concise
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
description and overview was extremely
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
helpful last week The Nature Conservancy
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
supports a rapid transition
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
to clean our local more sustainable
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
energy sources and we are a large
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
landowner an easement holder and a
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
steward of lands around the state that
 
02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:01.340 align:start position:0%
we manage for a range of values
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
including sustainable Agriculture and
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
Forestry among many others and we
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
understand deeply and work hard to
 
02:06:12.589 --> 02:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire has healthy
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
sustainable forests we are also keenly
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
aware of the many economic challenges
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
that Northern
 
02:06:23.169 --> 02:06:23.179 align:start position:0%
in rural parts of our state face
 
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
especially in koas County which is home
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
to some of our state's richest and most
 
02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.490 align:start position:0%
to some of our state's richest and most
beautiful

02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
natural resources but as you know
 
02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
struggles to enjoy the economic
 
02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:38.780 align:start position:0%
successes of other parts of our state
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
and we at the at the nature conservancy
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
we know that the wood-based economy of
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
our state is really important to the
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
health of the North country and we are
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
particularly supportive of modern wood
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
Heat Technologies and those which
 
02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:55.450 align:start position:0%
Heat Technologies and those which
efficiently

02:06:55.450 --> 02:06:55.460 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
help us take advantage of sustainably
 
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
harvested wood
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
with respect to the original Bill House
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 142 as you heard last week
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the PPA at issue in this
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill has already resulted in
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
approximately 150 million dollars
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
in over-market costs that are paid
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
through the stranded cost recovery
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
charge by eversource customers and we
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
think that at this time it's not a
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
prudent use of our very limited
 
02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:29.709 align:start position:0%
prudent use of our very limited
resources

02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:29.719 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
particularly at a time when people are
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
struggling with with such high energy
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
bills and when you have several bills
 
02:07:38.930 --> 02:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
before you looking at ways to protect
 
02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
customers and reduce energy costs
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
the original Bill does not provide
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient guidance to the puc regarding
 
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
reforming the PPA to stop the
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
ever-increasing over-market cerantic
 
02:07:54.649 --> 02:07:54.659 align:start position:0%
costs by requiring
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
that the puc approve any and all relief
 
02:08:00.770 --> 02:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
for the plants without any parameters on
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
cost and it doesn't include sufficient
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
direction to ever Source regarding steps
 
02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
it could take to manage the contract
 
02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.219 align:start position:0%
differently to reduce those stranded
 
02:08:11.219 --> 02:08:13.129 align:start position:0%
differently to reduce those stranded
costs

02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
and we think the legislature should
 
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
instead ensure that incentives for clean
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
energy are available to all clean
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
Technologies in ways that reduce cost
 
02:08:25.729 --> 02:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
and provide broader benefits
 
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the amendment
 
02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:29.930 align:start position:0%
with respect to the amendment
um

02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
I want to thank chairman Vos for taking
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
a different approach because the current
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
one hasn't been working
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
but want to draw attention to the
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
language that would forgive 50 million
 
02:08:49.209 --> 02:08:49.219 align:start position:0%
of the 150 million in over Market costs
 
02:08:52.129 --> 02:08:52.139 align:start position:0%
we don't support that forgiveness we do
 
02:08:52.139 --> 02:08:53.169 align:start position:0%
we don't support that forgiveness we do
understand

02:08:53.169 --> 02:08:53.179 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
the economic realities that the plant is
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
facing but we would Advocate and
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you simply add
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
the 50 million to the 100 million dollar
 
02:09:04.199 --> 02:09:05.870 align:start position:0%
the 50 million to the 100 million dollar
balance

02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
balance
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
that the plant is carrying so that rate
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
payers at least have a chance someday in
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
we also believe that the amendment
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
should require that the puc open a
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
docket to address these issues
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
and that it should provide clear
 
02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
direction to the puc and to eversource
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
so that if ever source is required to
 
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
continue to sell the output from the
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
plant that it be required to do so in a
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
way that reduces cost to rate payers and
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
reduces those over-market stranded costs
 
02:09:46.850 --> 02:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
one approach could be to change the
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
requirement that eversource resell the
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
power and instead use it for default
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
service I don't know if that would work
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
but it seems that every option should be
 
02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
on the table particularly when prices
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
are so high
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
and rate payers are having to pay
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
stranded costs because of the price
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
differential between the PPA and the
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
market costs that eversource receives
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
and I think that that that approach in a
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
new docket could also
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
help inform future ppas that the state
 
02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
might entertain with new clean energy
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your perspective
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
on this legislation do we have questions
 
02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll thank you again and ask
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
Mr Tom friends of the New Hampshire
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to give us his
 
02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:48.050 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to give us his
perspective

02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Vose and members
 
02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
of stne thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
testify this morning on the amendment to
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
HB 142 as you know the department of
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
energy opposed the original Bill we are
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
neutral on this one but we think it's a
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous improvement over the original
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
hb142 we do want to point out that this
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
won't solve all the issues
 
02:11:28.129 --> 02:11:28.139 align:start position:0%
the cumulative reduction factors is
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
still there
 
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
markets will be what they are and if
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
they revert back to the types of pricing
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
we saw in the markets previously the CRF
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
will increase and we will
 
02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.139 align:start position:0%
probably back to where we were years ago
 
02:11:48.649 --> 02:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
with the number going above the 100
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
that said we are happy to work with
 
02:11:58.070 --> 02:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
with you and others uh going forward and
 
02:12:07.129 --> 02:12:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Doug
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
um considering uh Miss Hatfield's
 
02:12:18.609 --> 02:12:18.619 align:start position:0%
previous suggestion and her testimony uh
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about those suggestions
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
if they're viable or not and should we
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
it used to be used the the purchase of
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
purchases 500 000 megawatt hours of
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
energy previously it was used when the
 
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
company was vertically integrated as
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
part of its portfolio
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
after divestiture as you know it's
 
02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
basically a almost simultaneous Buy sell
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
into the market are there ways to
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
minimize that certainly but with those
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
ways come additional risks either to the
 
02:13:01.129 --> 02:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
company or uh
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
potentially to rate payers so
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
it takes two to change this contract
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think you can ask the puc to open up a
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
docket and look at it but obviously this
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
is a contract that would need to be
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
agreed to for any changes by both
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
eversource and by by Burgess I've looked
 
02:13:28.370 --> 02:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
at other ways to minimize this looking
 
02:13:31.010 --> 02:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
at forward strips
 
02:13:34.609 --> 02:13:34.619 align:start position:0%
a three-year five-year unpeak off-peak
 
02:13:34.619 --> 02:13:35.629 align:start position:0%
a three-year five-year unpeak off-peak
strips

02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
strips
 
02:13:35.639 --> 02:13:38.629 align:start position:0%
strips
and

02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
it may reduce that amount by having
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
higher values sold in at on Peak periods
 
02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
but quite honestly the prices when I
 
02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:49.619 align:start position:0%
looked at them really weren't that high
 
02:13:49.619 --> 02:13:51.169 align:start position:0%
looked at them really weren't that high
uh

02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
so and those prices could change
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
we'd work with parties if they're
 
02:14:00.770 --> 02:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
amendable to that but uh
 
02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
you know I think we're fine with where
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
we are right now and going back to the
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
100 million like I said we're fairly
 
02:14:09.649 --> 02:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
neutral on this and we think it's a
 
02:14:11.330 --> 02:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
tremendous improvement over the original
 
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:14.149 align:start position:0%
tremendous improvement over the original
hb142

02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
hb142
 
02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think there are any silver
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly has a question
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr friends
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
for being here I'd just like to say
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for the I was
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
reading the original PPA from 2011 and
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
seeing your name listed there I'd like
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your many years of
 
02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
service to the state
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
um my question is how um we had we heard
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
the um the the floating of of using it
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the default service right how much
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh what is the capacity required by
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
eversource for the default service ah
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
good question uh eversources total
 
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
retail sales in a year about 7.6 to 7.8
 
02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hours uh they're re
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
their default Service solicitations uh
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
broken out between
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
cni and and residential customers is
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 4 million megawatt hour
 
02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:19.619 align:start position:0%
range and the purchase of this is 500
 
02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
000 megawatt hours so
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's a little over 10
 
02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's a little over 10
percent

02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
depends on the year but in that range
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an insignificant number
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
but it's also not a you know it's not a
 
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
well seeing no further questions I want
 
02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
to thank you for uh stopping by this
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
morning and giving us your perspective
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
my pleasure thank you representative
 
02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
my pleasure thank you representative
okay

02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
next I'll ask Jason stock to come up and
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
give us his perspective on this
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
legislative proposed legislation
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
well good morning uh for the record I'm
 
02:16:43.009 --> 02:16:43.019 align:start position:0%

and I'm happy to come here and speak in
 
02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:51.059 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and in support of
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
and really in support of the the effort
 
02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
to keep this important Market going uh
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
I've testified before you before on
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 165 166 and gave you a lot of
 
02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
information about the state's Timberland
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
the state's Forest products industry
 
02:17:12.889 --> 02:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
um and why low-grade wood markets are a
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
very important part of that fabric
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
and so I won't out of respect for your
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
time I won't get into all the details
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
and nuances of trees and Forestry
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
although I'd love to but I won't this
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
morning but I just want to hit a couple
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
high points and then I'd be happy to
 
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.030 align:start position:0%
answer questions
um

02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
you know in and again by way of
 
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
background for some of the new folks
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
here uh just a couple quick points on
 
02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
who nhtoa is where landowners enforce
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
products industry our Members Own and or
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
manage about a million Acres of the
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
state's Timberland
 
02:17:50.049 --> 02:17:50.059 align:start position:0%
um the industry that this land base
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
supports is about a 2.5 billion dollar a
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
year industry and includes Sawmills
 
02:17:58.969 --> 02:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
power plants even some wood that's taken
 
02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
and used and chipped for paper making in
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
in Maine as well as in Eastern New York
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
um and you know this this power plant as
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier represents Burgess
 
02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:16.139 align:start position:0%
biopower represents about two 750
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
000 tons of biomass or low-grade wood a
 
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
year that's a huge piece of our our
 
02:18:24.770 --> 02:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
biomass Market
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I provided with you a a copy of the
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
state or a copy of the Timber tax
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
records for the state and you'll see in
 
02:18:37.009 --> 02:18:37.019 align:start position:0%
there gives you a summary of kind of all
 
02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
the wood that's harvested by county and
 
02:18:41.929 --> 02:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
you'll see when you compare this tonnage
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
against what that is it is it's pretty
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
it's pretty big the other piece is that
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
Sawmills use this market for Mill waste
 
02:18:54.169 --> 02:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
be it sawdust hardwood bark and Chip
 
02:18:54.179 --> 02:18:56.209 align:start position:0%
be it sawdust hardwood bark and Chip
slabs

02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
slabs
 
02:18:59.570 --> 02:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
um there was in and again I appreciate
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier comments about
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
modern wood heat we support that modern
 
02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
wood heat are like wood pellet boilers
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
things of that nature but again to put
 
02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
it in perspective and when you're
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the state as a landscape and
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
you're trying to manage this landscape
 
02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
um modern wood heat is is a small but
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
growing portion of the state's low-grade
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
wood Market but again in the context of
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
the broader landscape
 
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
Burgess is a is a very very important
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
piece of that so loss of Burgess for
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
modern wood heat or some of these other
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
applications to kind of supplant that
 
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
loss would take
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
I I would dare say many many many years
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
so as a landowner or a land manager
 
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
whether you're managing for
 
02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
sustainability managing you know Forest
 
02:19:55.969 --> 02:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
pest situations
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
um Burgess is is critical
 
02:20:02.929 --> 02:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
the you know our interest in the bill in
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
the original Bill appears in lines four
 
02:20:06.479 --> 02:20:07.429 align:start position:0%
the original Bill appears in lines four
um

02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
four through on pages four uh through
 
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
eight and again on 15 where it talks
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
about Forest Health supporting of the
 
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
industry and then on the amendment on
 
02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
page two
 
02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
starting at page 11 that discusses
 
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
public you know economic contributions
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
and public interest and I I wanted to
 
02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:27.170 align:start position:0%
and public interest and I I wanted to
just

02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know there are this idea of public
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
interest appears also in the RPS law as
 
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
well as LIPA and this is a you know an
 
02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
issue that I think is important to kind
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
of bring kind of bring forth in in the
 
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
hearing and get it on the record that
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things about public interest
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
or one of the considerations is fuel
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
diversity and having having energy that
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
is is cleaner but and and and uh it is
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
renewable and like I said this this
 
02:21:03.410 --> 02:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
facility checks all those boxes
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to hear some of the
 
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
discussion that was that was just I just
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
witnessed about the concept of looking
 
02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
at some other Alternatives be it default
 
02:21:15.889 --> 02:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
or things of that nature I've spent some
 
02:21:17.809 --> 02:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time this summer working
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
with the chairman when he had some
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
subgroups looking at this and I do think
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
there may be a solution in that
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and I would I would hate to see us
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution after this
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
facility is shuttered so I think the
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity to keep this
 
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
facility going
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
keep it going as we continue to look at
 
02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
are there Solutions I think is critical
 
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that it is part of the
 
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
public interest it's a big piece of the
 
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
economy in the North Country frankly
 
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's a big piece of the economy
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide when you look at those Timber
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
tax records and you see where this
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
biomass is being harvested
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
so again I will
 
02:21:59.450 --> 02:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
that the last point I want to raise is
 
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and although it hasn't come up I just
 
02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
want to remind folks that you know when
 
02:22:04.969 --> 02:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
it comes to carbon neutrality and some
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the environmental issues the EPA has
 
02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
has determined that biomass is in fact
 
02:22:13.849 --> 02:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral and as I have said before
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
when you look at our state and you look
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
at our forest and our growth and our
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
Timber growth and this is using USDA
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
Forest Service data we continue to grow
 
02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
more wood than we Harvest or dies
 
02:22:28.849 --> 02:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
through more natural mortality so one of
 
02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
one of the most cleanest and best
 
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
standards for sustainability in carbon
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
neutrality which all that standing
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
Timber is stored carbon is the fact that
 
02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
we continue to accrue more Forest across
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
the state and so with that I'll I'll
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I appreciate your
 
02:22:49.250 --> 02:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
time this morning and I truly appreciate
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
your efforts to to try to keep this
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
important Market Market viable thank you
 
02:22:57.650 --> 02:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you as usual very informative and
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
succinct We Appreciate You testifying
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a lot of questions here
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
for you I see so we'll start with
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony actually the paperwork
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
you handed out to us
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
question I have is in regards to
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
um as as we all know locally in the and
 
02:23:19.250 --> 02:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
nationally on the news the Silicon
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
Valley Bank collapsed and myself
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
personally I've always been against bank
 
02:23:26.530 --> 02:23:26.540 align:start position:0%
bailouts and I'm conflicted here because
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
with when you're talking about a bailout
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
you're hoping that a business can
 
02:23:32.929 --> 02:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
continue on without having to come back
 
02:23:35.210 --> 02:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
take another bite in the Apple what can
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
you tell us that if this looks like a
 
02:23:39.889 --> 02:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
bailout and if it was how would you know
 
02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
or how can you verify that you wouldn't
 
02:23:44.210 --> 02:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
be coming back again in a couple years
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
for another bite at the Apple
 
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
great question and you know it's
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
I guess the in to use your term you know
 
02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
the bailout or subsidies another term
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's frequently used I would
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
argue that this facility in particularly
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
in today's markets with the volatility
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we see
 
02:24:08.929 --> 02:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
um it's just like any stock portfolio
 
02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
you have underperformers and you have
 
02:24:14.450 --> 02:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
older above performers or high
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
performers I should say in having a mix
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
over time will serve you well I I
 
02:24:22.849 --> 02:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
contend or argue that when you look at
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
energy and you look at energy markets
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
having that diversity and again I come
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
back to the public interest and maybe
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
there's a price to that diversity but
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
over time I would argue that as a
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
consumer and taking that volatility out
 
02:24:38.809 --> 02:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
so we're not subject to the fluctuations
 
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
that we see in natural gas there is a
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
value to that how you quantify that is
 
02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
the trick and that is the difficult part
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
but to have Burgess up there and and the
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
other you know Bridgewater power
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
producing power when we see when we have
 
02:24:59.090 --> 02:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
an Arctic vortex in their shaving some
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
of that you know steep curve on the
 
02:25:03.650 --> 02:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
natural gas piece I think there's a
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
value to that that's why I'm I'm
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
encouraged to hear some of the
 
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
discussions when we look at Vehicles
 
02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
like the default power and other ways to
 
02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
say all right yes this is this is more
 
02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
expensive than on a day like today where
 
02:25:19.969 --> 02:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
natural gas is abundant and there isn't
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
a huge energy energy demand given the
 
02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
the temperature
 
02:25:27.290 --> 02:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
but when we need it we want to make sure
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's there so that we can have it so how
 
02:25:31.309 --> 02:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
do we how do we make that bridge how do
 
02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
we figure it out
 
02:25:34.490 --> 02:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's not a clear answer to your question
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
I wish as you heard probably many times
 
02:25:38.929 --> 02:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
already I know you have there's no
 
02:25:40.849 --> 02:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
Silver Bullet but I do think there's
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
value in it just like having a
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
diversified stock or Investment
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
Portfolio this is part of our energy
 
02:25:47.399 --> 02:25:50.450 align:start position:0%
Portfolio this is part of our energy
portfolio

02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
02:25:54.530 --> 02:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this is in respect
 
02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
to you representing the Timberland
 
02:26:01.849 --> 02:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
Owners Association
 
02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
if Burgess were to close if
 
02:26:07.309 --> 02:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
what would actually be the effect upon
 
02:26:10.370 --> 02:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
the Timberland owners
 
02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
so that the impact on Timberland owners
 
02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:16.580 align:start position:0%
the owner the landowners themselves
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
there is a what what it does we would
 
02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:22.030 align:start position:0%
there is a what what it does we would
lose

02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
lose
 
02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
several things right out of the gate one
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
we would those landowners out there
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do having Forest management
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
plans trying to execute Forest
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
management plans
 
02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
that involve weeding and thinning
 
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
removing diseased or damaged trees those
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that would be much
 
02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
much more difficult and costly and in
 
02:26:48.889 --> 02:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
many instances unable to because you
 
02:26:50.690 --> 02:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
literally have no place to take that
 
02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:52.570 align:start position:0%
literally have no place to take that
wood

02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:52.580 align:start position:0%
wood
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
certainly from a cost-effective
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
standpoint you'd have no place to take
 
02:26:58.730 --> 02:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
it and so for a landowner
 
02:27:01.250 --> 02:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
and I may have you know
 
02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
eighty hundred thousand acres I have a
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
have this acreage I need a home for all
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
species all grade of wood this Market
 
02:27:11.929 --> 02:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
takes that
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
wood that's unable to produce Lumber
 
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
Market goes away I have a management
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
plan I call up Chopper Bob to come in
 
02:27:24.969 --> 02:27:24.979 align:start position:0%
and do my Timber sale yes Chopper Bob
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
chopper Bob comes in and he says Jason
 
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
great Timber I can cut that tree that
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
tree but that red maple over there
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
that's twisted bro you know that got
 
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
damaged in the ice storm can't touch it
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have any place to take it and so
 
02:27:43.250 --> 02:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
as a landowner what I'm faced with is
 
02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay Chopper Bob do you come in and high
 
02:27:48.410 --> 02:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
grade and take the best and now I have a
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
stand that's left but nothing but weeds
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
or do I or do I tell Chopper Bob
 
02:27:56.929 --> 02:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
you know come back another day how do we
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know or let's not do it
 
02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
when the when the biomass plants closed
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh after the The veto battle several
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
years ago we saw an immediate
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
contraction and logging capacity
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
Chopper Bob that maybe had two Crews
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
laid one off and now has one and so
 
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
again we have situations where
 
02:28:20.090 --> 02:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
landowners are having a difficult time
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
attracting loggers to come finding
 
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
loggers that have bodies that can come
 
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
and cut the wood
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so there that's kind of the the
 
02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:30.170 align:start position:0%
um so there that's kind of the the
immediate

02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
the immediate impact that we'll see the
 
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
other is for Sawmills that are still
 
02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
trying to manage their Mill waste I have
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
I have members of Mills I mean some of
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
these Mills to put it in perspective
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
produce a couple tractor-trailer loads
 
02:28:49.849 --> 02:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
of wood chips a day so you start this is
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
not stuff you can just pile it out back
 
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
for a couple weeks you've got to do
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
something with it
 
02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and so they they also run into
 
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh I'm really referring specifically to
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
Burgess I mean it's not the only biomass
 
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
plant out there so if Burgess were to
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
close how dire would these effects be
 
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
they would be they would be pretty dire
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
I mean Burgess 750
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
000 Green tons
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
the only the other biomass plant that's
 
02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
running is a couple hundred thousand
 
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
green tons
 
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:29:30.170 --> 02:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
and again look at the timber tax data
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
that you have from the Department of
 
02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:32.750 align:start position:0%
that you have from the Department of
Revenue

02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
that gives you a perspective of the
 
02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
importance of this facility in that
 
02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:40.610 align:start position:0%
importance of this facility in that
Marketplace

02:29:40.610 --> 02:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
02:29:42.530 --> 02:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a question
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up on this uh I
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
represent a big portion of the North
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
Country all the unincorporated towns and
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
everything and when this the biomass
 
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
closed three years ago we saw an
 
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
immediate impact on the timber industry
 
02:29:57.770 --> 02:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
although it looks like bombs go off if I
 
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
wish I had film of in Milan like the
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
thousands of Acres they just come in and
 
02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
take the good wood and they leave in
 
02:30:04.910 --> 02:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
everything else because there's no
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
market and the price went down I don't
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
know Jason it probably quote the price
 
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
it went way down in one year and this
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
was the only show in town
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we had so it is it had an immediate
 
02:30:17.090 --> 02:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
impact because we had five of the
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
biomass plants in the state that closed
 
02:30:19.439 --> 02:30:20.690 align:start position:0%
biomass plants in the state that closed
so

02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so it it will only get worse than
 
02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
what because we're already seeing it in
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
the North country
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
not doing the timber management that
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
they could do they can't afford to do it
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's no market for that low-grade
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
wood and that's the majority of the
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony and I'm
 
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
just wondering how do you square that
 
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is good for the four state
 
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
forestry industry with the previous
 
02:30:55.730 --> 02:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
testimony that it is not in the best
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
interest of the rate payers so I guess
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
my question is does your industry factor
 
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
in rate payers in its determination of
 
02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:03.770 align:start position:0%
in rate payers in its determination of
support

02:31:03.770 --> 02:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:05.170 align:start position:0%
support
certainly

02:31:05.170 --> 02:31:05.180 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
Sawmills are huge huge electricity
 
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.150 align:start position:0%
Sawmills are huge huge electricity
consumers

02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and we've had these discussions at in
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
our board of directors rooms because
 
02:31:16.730 --> 02:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
I'll have Sawmill owners that'll come in
 
02:31:18.410 --> 02:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
and say I've got a huge load of
 
02:31:20.929 --> 02:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
electricity I've got a lot of conveyors
 
02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
I've got a big saw I've got cranes and
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
again they come back and I think part of
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
it is Yankee pragmatism they come back
 
02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
and they they say let's take a look at
 
02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
this let's take a step back and look at
 
02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
what I had talked about earlier about
 
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
the the the uh the fact that we have a
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
local homegrown power that also helps
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide a hedge against some of the
 
02:31:45.410 --> 02:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
volatility that we see particularly in
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
recent months with the natural gas
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
market and so I think when we look at it
 
02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
and and we are rate payers and we are
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
big rate payers particularly in many
 
02:31:56.450 --> 02:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
rural communities we look at it and say
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
is the cost worth the benefit and we say
 
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
yes and that's how we Square it Square
 
02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
it and we've again we've had this
 
02:32:06.530 --> 02:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had a lot of
 
02:32:08.270 --> 02:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
discussions had our board of directors
 
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
and we always come back to that answer
 
02:32:13.610 --> 02:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
and that's a that's a great question
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:32:22.250 --> 02:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
um my question has to do I want to go
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
back to your mention of the um modern
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
wood heating industry and you know the
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
wood pellet industry
 
02:32:30.479 --> 02:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
wood pellet industry
um

02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:34.450 --> 02:32:34.460 align:start position:0%
and as far as I'm aware there's
 
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
one large uh pellet manufacturing plant
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the state down in Jaffrey right New
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
England would pellet uh I'm wondering
 
02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
England would pellet uh I'm wondering
how

02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:32:49.370 --> 02:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
it has there ever been a proposal or has
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
there ever been discussion at least
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
around the prospect of
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
um investment some you know an investor
 
02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:58.969 align:start position:0%
um investment some you know an investor
group

02:32:58.969 --> 02:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
um uh establishing a a pellet plant in
 
02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
the North country where the enormous
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
supply of of wood is and would that be a
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
potential Avenue for you know addressing
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
this Market because you mentioned that
 
02:33:17.210 --> 02:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
should buy biomass Burgess go away it
 
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
would take a long time for the modern
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
wood heating Industries to sort of fill
 
02:33:23.410 --> 02:33:23.420 align:start position:0%
that demand but
 
02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
great question and there are several
 
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
there are several pellet manufacturers
 
02:33:31.610 --> 02:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
in fact one Sawmill installed a pellet
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
Mill over in um
 
02:33:36.290 --> 02:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
over in Springfield the New London area
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
Durgin and Kroll they put in a pellet
 
02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
facility and that pellet facility they
 
02:33:42.349 --> 02:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
they put it in
 
02:33:42.359 --> 02:33:43.190 align:start position:0%
they put it in
um

02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to get into the wood
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
pellet business but they also saw wait a
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
minute you know biomass markets are
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
shaky we have Mill waste let's at least
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
hedge our bets when it comes to managing
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
our waste and we'll invest and build a
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
pellet Mill so there are out there
 
02:34:00.650 --> 02:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
um the other thing with modern wood heat
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
are combined heat and power you know
 
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
small like commercial industrial boiler
 
02:34:07.370 --> 02:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
systems that's another so I don't want
 
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
you to think it's just solely pellets
 
02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
um there is a study commission
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is squirming in
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
his chair but there is a study
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission looking at this he was this
 
02:34:23.570 --> 02:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor yes Doug Thomas but he he
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
was the Prime sponsor and this is one of
 
02:34:26.929 --> 02:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
the things that this commission is
 
02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
looking at again the elite this is part
 
02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:32.300 align:start position:0%
of the problem is you have a lead time
 
02:34:37.010 --> 02:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
and you know we have 750
 
02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
000 Green tons that could be gone like
 
02:34:43.730 --> 02:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
that if this plant closes and it you
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
were not afforded any type of lead time
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
but there are folks looking at pellet
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
facilities biochar is another one
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
um there's some other things but it
 
02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
takes time and the I'll say
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas's low-grade
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
commission is which is um which is
 
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
sorting through this right now and
 
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
looking at it and trying to say all
 
02:35:07.010 --> 02:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
right where can the Department of
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs start
 
02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
putting some resources to it to promote
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
and Mr squirm representative Doug Thomas
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
02:35:24.290 --> 02:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.770 --> 02:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative Kelly has a question
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
Mr stock think nice to see you again
 
02:35:32.270 --> 02:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
good morning so I I we have some
 
02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of us about repair
 
02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:35.630 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of us about repair
rates

02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:35:38.270 --> 02:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
um uh you know the cost of this
 
02:35:40.250 --> 02:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and I I haven't heard it mentioned
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
much but the one of the
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
Sawmills that generates the most amount
 
02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
of waste our pallet bills and I and I
 
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
would ask you if this our state benefits
 
02:35:55.130 --> 02:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
from a lower cost of pallets for our
 
02:35:57.469 --> 02:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
other manufactured goods because of the
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
ability to Output or to have a market
 
02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
for the trimmings from the from that
 
02:36:04.849 --> 02:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
pallet process it
 
02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
great question in in your your right the
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a pallet Mill
 
02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
um again when when the when the five
 
02:36:15.410 --> 02:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
biomass plants went down
 
02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:16.010 align:start position:0%
biomass plants went down
um

02:36:16.010 --> 02:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
when they went down there was this
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
reshuffling of the marketplace people
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
are scrambling to figure out where do I
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
send wood
 
02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
and there were stories of people sending
 
02:36:26.819 --> 02:36:27.710 align:start position:0%
and there were stories of people sending
wood

02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
wood
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
up into Canada you know I've got a load
 
02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
of chips I have to get rid of this I
 
02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
cannot put this out back whether it's a
 
02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
pallet Mill whether it's a just a
 
02:36:39.050 --> 02:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
sawmill a white pine Mill that's sawing
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
boards or a spruce fur making
 
02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
dimensional Lumber hardwood making trims
 
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
for tables and such I got to get rid of
 
02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:47.150 align:start position:0%
for tables and such I got to get rid of
this

02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and if I start piling up out back I'm
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to have issues with the town you
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
know with my neighbors Etc and so there
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
is a a direct cost Associated and they
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
said all right we're gonna we have to
 
02:37:01.010 --> 02:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
get rid of it we're going to take it on
 
02:37:03.410 --> 02:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
the chin so again part of this whole
 
02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
economic chain is that Mill waste and
 
02:37:11.090 --> 02:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
and ability to cost effectively manage
 
02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
and ability to cost effectively manage
that

02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:18.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:37:18.969 --> 02:37:18.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and now we'll call in
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
the very last person to testify before

02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:47.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
um

my name is Catherine corkery I'm from
 
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sierra Club thank you for
 
02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
being here this morning
 
02:37:57.650 --> 02:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
um with the continuation of this and the
 
02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:58.730 align:start position:0%
um with the continuation of this and the
other

02:37:58.730 --> 02:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
hearings today
 
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Sierra Club is in
 
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill
 
02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:08.690 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill
um

02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:12.889 --> 02:38:12.899 align:start position:0%
and it it is it is a difficult situation
 
02:38:12.899 --> 02:38:13.969 align:start position:0%
and it it is it is a difficult situation
but

02:38:13.969 --> 02:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
I do want to highlight
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
who else is taking this on the chin
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
rate pairs
 
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
when you think about the stranded costs
 
02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
since 2010 when this PPA was established
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I do not have a complete list
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
the Schiller station cleanup
 
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
where they're before they sold it off
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
there is also
 
02:38:49.319 --> 02:38:50.929 align:start position:0%
there is also
the

02:38:50.929 --> 02:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:54.130 --> 02:38:54.140 align:start position:0%
um Merrimack station
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
retrofit and then they sold it off
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
rate payers had to pick up that those
 
02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:02.690 align:start position:0%
rate payers had to pick up that those
tabs

02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
tabs
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
10 years we have have this PPA
 
02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:14.630 align:start position:0%
10 years we have have this PPA
where

02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:39:17.929 --> 02:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
this bill it says that there's going to
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
be a 50 million dollar
 
02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:23.150 align:start position:0%
be a 50 million dollar
Erasure

02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
Erasure
 
02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm not convinced that it's it's
 
02:39:30.050 --> 02:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
a 150 million dollar
 
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
that that's significant and and the
 
02:39:41.710 --> 02:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
commission or I'm sorry the uh chair
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
noted that there's been I think you said
 
02:39:47.690 --> 02:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars
 
02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:49.070 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars
um

02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
just for the this facility I think is
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
what I heard
 
02:39:56.040 --> 02:39:57.530 align:start position:0%
what I heard
um

02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:00.889 --> 02:40:00.899 align:start position:0%
I kind of feel like it the rate payers
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
are the ATM of all these facilities and
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's I I'm kind of tired of being the
 
02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:09.230 align:start position:0%
that's I I'm kind of tired of being the
ATM

02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
ATM
 
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
and because I'm one of those people
 
02:40:14.650 --> 02:40:14.660 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
this is 75 megawatts
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
of wet wood
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
the output of Which is less than 20
 
02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:26.809 align:start position:0%
the output of Which is less than 20
percent

02:40:26.809 --> 02:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:40:29.690 --> 02:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
of electricity
 
02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
so what what did Jason say
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
750 what was it 750
 
02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:38.950 align:start position:0%
750 what was it 750
000

02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:47.710 --> 02:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of what one
 
02:40:50.929 --> 02:40:50.939 align:start position:0%
absolutely huge but I feel as though
 
02:40:55.490 --> 02:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
that this by paying this in pain back in
 
02:40:58.730 --> 02:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
and putting more money more money into
 
02:41:01.809 --> 02:41:01.819 align:start position:0%
this facility are we
 
02:41:05.210 --> 02:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
hindering other types of development in
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
the North Country two billion dollars
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
worth of money going into these this
 
02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
worth of money going into these this
facility

02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
where is the money not going for
 
02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:16.849 align:start position:0%
where is the money not going for
development

02:41:16.849 --> 02:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
is my question and my second question
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the original Bill and and
 
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
also in in the puc or in the second
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
amendment in the amendment I'm sorry
 
02:41:33.710 --> 02:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh what do you expect the puc to do
 
02:41:37.730 --> 02:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
I mean do you want them to
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
throw away the contract
 
02:41:43.130 --> 02:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
do you want to change the terms
 
02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
is that is that fair
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
I don't I I I I'm I I'm asking you
 
02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:56.809 align:start position:0%
I don't I I I I'm I I'm asking you
um

02:41:56.809 --> 02:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:59.809 --> 02:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
in in other bills
 
02:41:59.819 --> 02:42:00.469 align:start position:0%
in in other bills
um

02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:00.479 --> 02:42:01.849 align:start position:0%
um
similar

02:42:01.849 --> 02:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
we we heard that this would run afoul of
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
the Constitution or I don't I don't know
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
if if there's a suggestion of of
 
02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
changing a private contract in this bill
 
02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
but I what what do you want the PC to do
 
02:42:21.889 --> 02:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
I guess is is really what I'm asking
 
02:42:21.899 --> 02:42:23.330 align:start position:0%
I guess is is really what I'm asking
and

02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:29.090 --> 02:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question for
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:42:35.809 --> 02:42:35.819 align:start position:0%
Ms corkery for taking my question
 
02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
we heard from Mr stock about the
 
02:42:42.650 --> 02:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
implications of closing the plan in
 
02:42:45.170 --> 02:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
terms of the health of the forest itself
 
02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
how people would manage it what would
 
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
happen to the trees I would assume that
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
the Sierra Club is very interested in
 
02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
the health of the forest so I'm
 
02:42:56.210 --> 02:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
wondering how do you counterbalance that
 
02:42:59.809 --> 02:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
we have uh no surprise probably a very
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
different philosophy about how how
 
02:43:04.809 --> 02:43:04.819 align:start position:0%
forests are managed
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
our biggest concern is the Public Public
 
02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:10.150 align:start position:0%
our biggest concern is the Public Public
forests

02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
forests
 
02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:13.979 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
the idea that Forest needs to be managed
 
02:43:21.650 --> 02:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
is a little less
 
02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
um of a concern for us
 
02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
um we'd like to see a diversity of of
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
trees in our national forests in our
 
02:43:32.809 --> 02:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
public lands
 
02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
um by clearing away these you know waste
 
02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.849 align:start position:0%
um by clearing away these you know waste
trees

02:43:37.849 --> 02:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
trees
 
02:43:40.610 --> 02:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
um that they could be homes for lots of
 
02:43:43.370 --> 02:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and habitat
 
02:43:47.090 --> 02:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
um that do not like the the thinner
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
trees or do not like
 
02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
um more space
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and so there's there's we have a
 
02:43:56.990 --> 02:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
really different aspect to that and I
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to produce any
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a report that I can
 
02:44:04.849 --> 02:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
share with you about that
 
02:44:08.090 --> 02:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
um it that also comes to mind if I could
 
02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:09.710 align:start position:0%
um it that also comes to mind if I could
um

02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
just thinking about
 
02:44:15.070 --> 02:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
the public good
 
02:44:17.450 --> 02:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
what if what if this was not a wood
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
burner what if it was a a windmill would
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
authorize the two billion dollars of
 
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
subsidies to a windmill project would
 
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
you have granted such
 
02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:38.450 align:start position:0%
you have granted such
generosity

02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
generosity
 
02:44:41.290 --> 02:44:41.300 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't think you would have
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
and this has been going on for a lot
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
longer a long time and you've had a lot
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
with this facility and it still isn't
 
02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly has a question
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd just like to provide some
 
02:45:04.849 --> 02:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
context to that the two billion dollar
 
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
figure my understanding is that two
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
billion dollars refers to all subsidies
 
02:45:10.730 --> 02:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
are given to the original biomass
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
facilities built in the 80s through the
 
02:45:14.210 --> 02:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
2011 PPA group I believe that's where
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
the two billion dollar figure comes from
 
02:45:18.410 --> 02:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
and in that context uh the 100 million
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
150 million 143 whatever it is that it
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
they are in if you compare that against
 
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
those those previous facilities Burgess
 
02:45:30.290 --> 02:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
is doing a better job of managing that
 
02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
or or closer to the actual market and
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know as someone who grew up in
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
Berlin who lived through the pulp Mill
 
02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
closures I can tell you that this year I
 
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
am the most excited for Berlin's future
 
02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
than I've ever been in my entire life um
 
02:45:46.010 --> 02:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
I grew up there my whole life I've seen
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
businesses come and go I've seen you
 
02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
know the pulp Mills close and it
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
honestly I'm one of the few young people
 
02:45:54.170 --> 02:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
who stuck around through this because of
 
02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:55.309 align:start position:0%
who stuck around through this because of
that

02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:56.450 --> 02:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
um The Brain Drain that happened
 
02:45:58.550 --> 02:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding that process do you have a
 
02:46:00.969 --> 02:46:00.979 align:start position:0%
question I do have a question
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the
 
02:46:11.270 --> 02:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
the ability for this Pro for this plant
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
to continue to operate
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the light remainder of its PPA 11
 
02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.210 align:start position:0%
for the light remainder of its PPA 11
years

02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
just keeps us from going through another
 
02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:22.250 align:start position:0%
just keeps us from going through another
collapse

02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
collapse
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and provide some you know you
 
02:46:27.290 --> 02:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 20 that's going to
 
02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
um the 20 rate of of capture the the
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
much has been made about the the project
 
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
in Berlin to capture that to clean our
 
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
sidewalks with the heat that process
 
02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
that project relies on the biomass plant
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
operating but will help us capture some
 
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the Lost energy that's going to uh
 
02:46:47.090 --> 02:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
into the environment currently there are
 
02:46:48.889 --> 02:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
exciting features that about this plant
 
02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
that are that are
 
02:46:53.929 --> 02:46:53.939 align:start position:0%
um that that we we look forward to and
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
we hope that we can capture more of that
 
02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:46:57.889 --> 02:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
um that energy
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
um but would you believe that this plant
 
02:47:02.450 --> 02:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
continuing to operate is part of that
 
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
and and and and you know
 
02:47:05.340 --> 02:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
and and and and you know
um

02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:08.690 --> 02:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
is important to the region I I
 
02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate you sharing that
 
02:47:11.399 --> 02:47:12.410 align:start position:0%
appreciate you sharing that
um

02:47:12.410 --> 02:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:15.899 align:start position:0%
staying in in a town in a city that has
 
02:47:19.010 --> 02:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
had hard times I I have that experience
 
02:47:23.210 --> 02:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
as well and and it is hard and um so
 
02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for sticking it out and I
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
I want to believe
 
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
that Berlin Berlin's future is
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
is bright
 
02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.070 align:start position:0%
is bright
um

02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
I I'm a little skeptical but I'm not as
 
02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
close to that process as you are
 
02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown has a
 
02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:51.969 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown has a
question

02:47:51.969 --> 02:47:51.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair initially I was going
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
to ask about the two billion dollars but
 
02:47:59.450 --> 02:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
I think that was clarified but I and
 
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
maybe I should have asked the forest the
 
02:48:04.370 --> 02:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
previous speaker about this
 
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
if this closes down
 
02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
how much land would you foresee
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's now for us that might be open up
 
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
for development and then might be less
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
available to the Sportsman and those
 
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
that use these lands for New Hampshire
 
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
citizens I don't have that number I'm
 
02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:27.050 align:start position:0%
citizens I don't have that number I'm
sorry

02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
Jason is definitely the better person
 
02:48:32.450 --> 02:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question thank
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
02:48:38.690 --> 02:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh you were concerned about the rate
 
02:48:43.130 --> 02:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
payers and the Burgess biomass falls in
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
the in the context of the renewable
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
energy program that was established by
 
02:48:49.270 --> 02:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
which effectively imposes an additional
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
cost on the on the rate payers to
 
02:48:57.530 --> 02:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
support the growth of these kinds of of
 
02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
projects solar wind and biomass
 
02:49:03.469 --> 02:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
hydropower also was picked up
 
02:49:03.479 --> 02:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
hydropower also was picked up
do

02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:10.090 --> 02:49:10.100 align:start position:0%
do you see the Burgess biomass as as
 
02:49:12.650 --> 02:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
effectively did you see that program as
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
being worthwhile in the continuity that
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
the emerges biomass needs to have uh
 
02:49:21.170 --> 02:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
existing in that being enough to offset
 
02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
the rate payer concerns I I don't think
 
02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:24.290 align:start position:0%
the rate payer concerns I I don't think
so

02:49:24.290 --> 02:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:26.929 --> 02:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
um we have one facility
 
02:49:29.090 --> 02:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
that has
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
a a crude
 
02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
125 million dollars
 
02:49:36.410 --> 02:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
of debt
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think there are any other
 
02:49:40.969 --> 02:49:40.979 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities that have
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
done that I could be wrong
 
02:49:46.130 --> 02:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
um but I I think they've been more
 
02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:47.950 align:start position:0%
um but I I think they've been more
successful

02:49:47.950 --> 02:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
successful
 
02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
this facility has has
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
we heard from the summary of the chair
 
02:49:58.490 --> 02:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
since the PPA which sounded like a great
 
02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
idea at the beginning
 
02:50:02.510 --> 02:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's been going back and forth back and
 
02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
forth when one party doesn't isn't
 
02:50:08.990 --> 02:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
making money they come here and get a
 
02:50:10.969 --> 02:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
change when the other party isn't making
 
02:50:15.530 --> 02:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
money they come here for a change
 
02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
I I the windmill projects aren't coming
 
02:50:22.010 --> 02:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
here for a change and or maybe a little
 
02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:23.230 align:start position:0%
here for a change and or maybe a little
bit

02:50:23.230 --> 02:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
the Solar projects are not coming back
 
02:50:32.450 --> 02:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
to make because of some dispute so yes
 
02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
we support renewable energy I think this
 
02:50:38.210 --> 02:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
is an outlier
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative murder has a question
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes so going back to the bills the past
 
02:50:47.210 --> 02:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
few years you've been 100 against all
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
the biomass bills you sent out a
 
02:50:50.690 --> 02:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
personal letter the night before the
 
02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
vote because I was on 165 against it
 
02:50:55.550 --> 02:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
because it was not clean renewable
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
energy so a lot of this is a lot of
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
fluff you're saying today but you oppose
 
02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
these plants
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's been your stance and that's been
 
02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know stance right along we've been
 
02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
consistent yes yeah when you well
 
02:51:09.770 --> 02:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
actually you said something different
 
02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
the day before and then the night you
 
02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
sent out letters and call people on the
 
02:51:15.650 --> 02:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
last vote so
 
02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
um you just go beaten a dead of course
 
02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
um you just go beaten a dead of course
here

02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
I I'm
 
02:51:24.650 --> 02:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
I would like to dispute that I don't
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate this I I I'm not really there
 
02:51:31.370 --> 02:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
was no question there so you don't need
 
02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
to respond thank you
 
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
Randy Thomas a representative Wendy
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
um just a point of order um I think it
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
is it does not behoove our committee to
 
02:51:45.530 --> 02:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
classify someone's testimony testimony
 
02:51:48.469 --> 02:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
is fluff thank you
 
02:51:50.630 --> 02:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sure representative merner
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
didn't mean that that way and uh regrets
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
what he had to say
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative well I I guess we've
 
02:52:03.230 --> 02:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
we've exhausted our question base here
 
02:52:05.210 --> 02:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
so that's good to see
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that concludes our testimony on House
 
02:52:09.769 --> 02:52:09.779 align:start position:0%
Bill 142.
 
02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing
 
02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
and this committee is now going to break
 
02:52:18.170 --> 02:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
for lunch and we will return
 
02:52:22.130 --> 02:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.530 --> 02:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
to have executive session but before we
 
02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
go representative closure is going to
 
02:52:28.969 --> 02:52:28.979 align:start position:0%
give us an indication of what the blue
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
02:52:40.610 --> 02:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.769 --> 02:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet it was four
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
supporting 23 opposed
 
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
on line 24 and support
 
02:52:55.090 --> 02:52:55.100 align:start position:0%

a blue sheep was
 
02:53:00.530 --> 02:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
two in support
 
02:53:06.349 --> 02:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
by the polls on line 81 in support and
 
02:53:09.410 --> 02:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
eight opposed and uh chairman that was
 
02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
for both days
 
02:53:13.490 --> 02:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
Belushi thank you great thank you
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative partial did you have a
 
02:53:15.479 --> 02:53:18.950 align:start position:0%
representative partial did you have a
question

02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%

we ask that you clear the room because
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
Republicans will be caucusing in this
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
room for
 
02:54:58.610 --> 02:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:00.650 --> 02:55:00.660 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
batches of cookies
 
04:21:03.469 --> 04:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
so if you need fortification to get
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
through the rest of this afternoon's
 
04:21:07.370 --> 04:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
exact session
 
04:21:10.490 --> 04:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
those cookies are courtesy of Tom cloje
 
04:21:12.530 --> 04:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
who had a birthday
 
04:21:14.929 --> 04:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
on March 1st
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay so we're here this afternoon to
 
04:21:30.650 --> 04:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:33.170 --> 04:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
and while I don't have a list right in
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
front of me off the top of my head I'll
 
04:21:38.050 --> 04:21:38.060 align:start position:0%
remember that they are 556
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
139 257 142 and 609. so we'll start with
 
04:21:45.729 --> 04:21:45.739 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
556. I'll open the executive session and
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'll call on representative Corman for a
 
04:21:51.239 --> 04:21:53.030 align:start position:0%
I'll call on representative Corman for a
motion

04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh on HB 556 I
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
move itl
 
04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
04:22:02.570 --> 04:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
I second the motion it's been moved and
 
04:22:06.410 --> 04:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
seconded that we itl House Bill 556
 
04:22:09.290 --> 04:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative Corman is recognized to
 
04:22:12.650 --> 04:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
tell us why thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:22:16.250 --> 04:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill has two main parts it directs
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
The Information Technology Council to
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
consider having state agencies using
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
support development of free and open
 
04:22:25.130 --> 04:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
source software it also directs the it
 
04:22:27.170 --> 04:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
Council to advise the commissioner of
 
04:22:28.849 --> 04:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
the I.T department on the ethics of
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
using artificial intelligence by state
 
04:22:31.439 --> 04:22:32.809 align:start position:0%
using artificial intelligence by state
agencies

04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the free and open source
 
04:22:38.090 --> 04:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
software there it has some advantages
 
04:22:41.809 --> 04:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
over proprietary software but I feel
 
04:22:43.969 --> 04:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
like overall we should be allowing the
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
agencies to decide what tools they want
 
04:22:49.010 --> 04:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
to use computers or tools I wouldn't
 
04:22:51.170 --> 04:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
would not tell my plumber hey you're
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
using Snap-on tools I think you should
 
04:22:55.610 --> 04:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
use Craftsman I think we should let the
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
agencies decide what it is that they
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
want to use there are also issues with
 
04:23:02.450 --> 04:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
compatibility the free and open source
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
products are not always compatible with
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
existing products there are training
 
04:23:08.450 --> 04:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
issues you might have to train people in
 
04:23:11.210 --> 04:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
how how to use them and also there's a
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
support issue with a lot of the free and
 
04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
open source software there isn't a
 
04:23:16.130 --> 04:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
number you can call
 
04:23:18.290 --> 04:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
regarding AI
 
04:23:20.210 --> 04:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
um for those who don't know I am a
 
04:23:21.769 --> 04:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth computer science Professor
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
retired for a little over a year so it's
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
been my business to understand what's
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
going on in computer science and even in
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
AI even though it's not my own area
 
04:23:34.490 --> 04:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
what I've seen is that the pace of
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
progress in AI has increased amazingly
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
fast in the last few years AI was pretty
 
04:23:44.570 --> 04:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
much dead back in the 80s and then in
 
04:23:46.969 --> 04:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
the last few years with machine learning
 
04:23:49.490 --> 04:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
and deep neural networks it has just
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
exploded and the we're really at an
 
04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
inflection point and the pace of
 
04:23:55.870 --> 04:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
progress is so fast that I cannot see
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
that we can keep up it with it right now
 
04:24:01.370 --> 04:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
at the government level the it Council
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
meets its six-month intervals and I just
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't see that they could actually keep
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
up with what's going on and as an
 
04:24:07.319 --> 04:24:08.150 align:start position:0%
up with what's going on and as an
example

04:24:08.150 --> 04:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
I imagine most of us have heard of chat
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
GPT this program that will write
 
04:24:14.570 --> 04:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
something if you ask it to write
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
something and I'm told that we'll it
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
will even write computer programs that
 
04:24:19.080 --> 04:24:20.210 align:start position:0%
will even write computer programs that
work

04:24:20.210 --> 04:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
six months ago chat GPT was not
 
04:24:25.790 --> 04:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
available to the public but it is now so
 
04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday I actually asked chat GPT to
 
04:24:31.250 --> 04:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
write the committee report and it
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually did a pretty serviceable job
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's not what I would submit but it
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
actually did a pretty serviceable job so
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
I think that just shows the the pace
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going at and I just don't see
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
that the it council could probably could
 
04:24:46.450 --> 04:24:46.460 align:start position:0%
possibly keep up with it
 
04:24:48.889 --> 04:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
04:24:50.929 --> 04:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
04:24:53.150 --> 04:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh almost
 
04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
everything that representative corman's
 
04:24:57.170 --> 04:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
stated I actually agree with the only
 
04:24:59.570 --> 04:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
thing I would add also is that with open
 
04:25:01.809 --> 04:25:01.819 align:start position:0%
source is also security as we all know
 
04:25:04.490 --> 04:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
most of us that have either Apple or
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
Windows and you get regularly secure
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
updates weekly or bi-weekly and with
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
open source there is no security updates
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
on these as well as also with um with
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
open source 2 this is also where the
 
04:25:21.290 --> 04:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
hackers actually live and this is
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
purposely that way so that way they can
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
manipulate Colonel DDOS other kinds of
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
attacks as well so I'm against as well
 
04:25:28.199 --> 04:25:29.870 align:start position:0%
attacks as well so I'm against as well
Ito

04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
Ito
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:37.729 --> 04:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
um I I support uh the motion by uh
 
04:25:39.710 --> 04:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Corman and the only thing
 
04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
I would like to add is I fully support
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
and recognize the ability of our state
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
workers and I believe that they are in
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
the best position to pick and choose
 
04:25:50.809 --> 04:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
which software product to use and to
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
manage their program and I think we
 
04:25:54.290 --> 04:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
should feel that way about all of our
 
04:25:56.330 --> 04:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
state workers thank you I intend to
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair
 
04:26:07.849 --> 04:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
um I also uh support the the motion to
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
itl this bill however I do think we need
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
to keep our eyes on I a AI going forward
 
04:26:15.769 --> 04:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
04:26:18.410 --> 04:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not not sure we need to develop laws
 
04:26:20.330 --> 04:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
but we certainly need to develop some
 
04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
kind of policy within within the state
 
04:26:23.929 --> 04:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
regarding that I think it's going to
 
04:26:25.610 --> 04:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
become a bigger and bigger Beast going
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
forward but I support itl for this Bill
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%

was apparently authored to a large
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
degree okay representative Summers as a
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman um we met
 
04:29:56.929 --> 04:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee met with the group and
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
um we agreed that this needed to be
 
04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
pushed along however there was some
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
phrasing we wanted to change in the uh
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the actual bill itself so this
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
amendment actually just changed a few
 
04:30:09.530 --> 04:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
lines and we agreed as a subcommittee
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
there was a couple places where it was
 
04:30:14.330 --> 04:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh forcing it along so we ended up
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
changing in like one of the last lines
 
04:30:18.530 --> 04:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
was I believe on page three the advance
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
warning of 30 days we added and um there
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
was a couple little couple sentences
 
04:30:24.649 --> 04:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
here and there we changed out of the
 
04:30:27.050 --> 04:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
original bill but it was a greed and
 
04:30:28.610 --> 04:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that needed to be amended
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%

shall be judged to be ought to pass with
Amendment

04:34:43.369 --> 04:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
zero nine two four h
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put this on the
 
04:34:50.510 --> 04:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and representative
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.090 --> 04:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
now with that we'll close the executive
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
04:35:01.561 --> 04:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
257.

04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
257.
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
so now
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open an exec session on
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.810 --> 04:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I will move ought to pass and offer
 
04:35:27.849 --> 04:35:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
-0939h which is finding its way to each
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
of you as we speak and I recognize
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.840 --> 04:35:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.929 --> 04:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
second it's been moved and seconded that
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
we judge House Bill 142 to be ought to
 
04:35:51.970 --> 04:35:51.980 align:start position:0%
pass as amended with Amendment
 
04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
0939 h
 
04:35:56.689 --> 04:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
which will shortly be in your in your
 
04:35:59.879 --> 04:36:01.010 align:start position:0%
which will shortly be in your in your
hands

04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
hands
 
04:36:04.010 --> 04:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
is very similar to the amendment that we
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
a week ago when we had the initial
 
04:36:10.730 --> 04:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
the only change is that we made the
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
language a little bit
 
04:36:16.199 --> 04:36:18.470 align:start position:0%
language a little bit
more

04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:36:18.480 --> 04:36:20.209 align:start position:0%
more
straightforward

04:36:20.209 --> 04:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
04:36:22.010 --> 04:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
the original version of the amendment
 
04:36:24.890 --> 04:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:26.689 --> 04:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
section two
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission authority to
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
amend orders
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
it had
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
a section one
 
04:36:39.170 --> 04:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
with two paragraphs underneath a and b
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
the new version adds a paragraph C
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
which is entitled new accruals to be
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
paid for by Burgess
 
04:36:50.631 --> 04:36:50.641 align:start position:0%
on a moving forward basis Burgess
 
04:36:52.609 --> 04:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
biopower will be responsible for any
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
further accumulations over 100 million
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollar balance of the CRF by remitting
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
payment pursuant to section
 
04:37:01.279 --> 04:37:03.051 align:start position:0%
payment pursuant to section
6.1.4

04:37:03.051 --> 04:37:03.061 align:start position:0%
6.1.4
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
C of the PPA it just makes it more
 
04:37:08.929 --> 04:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
explicit just exactly what we're doing
 
04:37:14.330 --> 04:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.609 --> 04:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
amount accumulated in the CRF that
 
04:37:20.631 --> 04:37:20.641 align:start position:0%
exceeds 100 million dollars
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
and stating that any future accruals
 
04:37:26.689 --> 04:37:26.699 align:start position:0%
will be dealt with
 
04:37:31.609 --> 04:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
so that is the amendment
 
04:37:36.830 --> 04:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the amendment
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah a question and a comment I guess
 
04:37:45.289 --> 04:37:45.299 align:start position:0%
first question is what about the 100
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
million is that still being addressed in
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
the terms of the existing PPA are they
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
still going to have to pay that back at
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
the end of the term
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes as the language of the bill States
 
04:37:56.160 --> 04:37:57.289 align:start position:0%
yes as the language of the bill States
uh

04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:59.689 --> 04:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
on a moving forward basis Burgess will
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
be responsible for any few further
 
04:38:01.920 --> 04:38:04.551 align:start position:0%
be responsible for any few further
accumulation

04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
accumulation
 
04:38:06.170 --> 04:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
04:38:08.689 --> 04:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
terms pursuant to the PPA
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the the existing 100
 
04:38:14.209 --> 04:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:38:16.250 --> 04:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
a language at the bottom of page one
 
04:38:19.730 --> 04:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
lines 27 through 30 say that the 100
 
04:38:22.490 --> 04:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars which accrued in the CRF
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
prior to the legislature's suspension of
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
the operation of the cap on the CRF
 
04:38:30.410 --> 04:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to the terms of the PBA
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you a follow-up on this
 
04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
um follow-up since we've been doing this
 
04:38:37.789 --> 04:38:37.799 align:start position:0%
bit with Burgess now for years and years
 
04:38:40.250 --> 04:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
and years and every year there's a new
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
reason why we should be subsidizing them
 
04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
just a little bit longer uh this is
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
supposedly the fix but we heard nothing
 
04:38:50.090 --> 04:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
out of them whatsoever when they
 
04:38:51.529 --> 04:38:51.539 align:start position:0%
testified I asked some specific
 
04:38:53.689 --> 04:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
questions explicitly and didn't get an
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
answer about what's going to happen a
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
year from now and my major concern is
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to be sitting here a year
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
from now or two years from now and
 
04:39:01.609 --> 04:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
they're going to be back in saying oh if
 
04:39:03.529 --> 04:39:03.539 align:start position:0%
you just give us another 50 million or
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
some other subsidy how do we know if
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
they agreed to live by the terms of the
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
PPA and not come back here begging for
 
04:39:12.650 --> 04:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is we don't
 
04:39:16.490 --> 04:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
essentially what this amendment does is
 
04:39:20.330 --> 04:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
it gives
 
04:39:24.051 --> 04:39:24.061 align:start position:0%
Burgess and eversource some time
 
04:39:24.061 --> 04:39:25.429 align:start position:0%
Burgess and eversource some time
to

04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
figure out if there is another way
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
if it involves a renegotiating
 
04:39:34.131 --> 04:39:34.141 align:start position:0%
renegotiation of the PPA they will have
 
04:39:36.410 --> 04:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
time to do that you know follow-up
 
04:39:39.170 --> 04:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay so what happens if the
 
04:39:43.010 --> 04:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.170 --> 04:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
well if the bill doesn't pass then I
 
04:39:45.180 --> 04:39:46.030 align:start position:0%
well if the bill doesn't pass then I
guess

04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
when the current suspension expires at
 
04:39:51.170 --> 04:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
the end of October
 
04:39:51.180 --> 04:39:52.730 align:start position:0%
the end of October
the

04:39:52.730 --> 04:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
previous order pertaining to this
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
situation will kick in and Burgess will
 
04:40:03.230 --> 04:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
immediately owe 48 million dollars and
 
04:40:05.090 --> 04:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
have to repay it in a 12-month period
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
which would to my understanding force
 
04:40:10.130 --> 04:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
them into bankruptcy if I remember
 
04:40:13.130 --> 04:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
correctly when we pass that bill as it
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
was last year we said now you've got 18
 
04:40:17.570 --> 04:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
months to get your act together and
 
04:40:19.250 --> 04:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
apparently they've done nothing it's
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
just week round for more money because
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
they they were given warning as part of
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
that hearing you've got until October of
 
04:40:28.970 --> 04:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
23 to get your act together to do
 
04:40:30.410 --> 04:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you got to do sell the
 
04:40:32.570 --> 04:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
plant whatever and apparently they
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything towards it just
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
standing around waiting for more money
 
04:40:38.208 --> 04:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
as best I can tell am I missing
 
04:40:41.330 --> 04:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
further a comment on this amendment
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:40:46.680 --> 04:40:47.570 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
chair

04:40:47.570 --> 04:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:40:47.580 --> 04:40:48.708 align:start position:0%
chair
um

04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
I will support this bill but I do uh
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
agree with comments made by the
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
representative to my right we have in
 
04:40:59.330 --> 04:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
the past
 
04:40:59.340 --> 04:41:00.770 align:start position:0%
the past
given

04:41:00.770 --> 04:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
given
 
04:41:03.530 --> 04:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
one chance maybe a second chance this
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
could be the third chance I'm not sure
 
04:41:06.770 --> 04:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:41:09.650 --> 04:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
I believe that the reason why I'm
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill is I believe Berlin
 
04:41:13.680 --> 04:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill is I believe Berlin
um

04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
needs something like this up there I
 
04:41:21.948 --> 04:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
believe that the health of our fars uh
 
04:41:24.410 --> 04:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
need a plant like Burgess and I believe
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
that it affects us a couple hundred jobs
 
04:41:29.690 --> 04:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
as well of our wood industry all over
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
the state but I also say that enough is
 
04:41:37.970 --> 04:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
enough and so I do support this bill I
 
04:41:40.970 --> 04:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
want to see them succeed this I believe
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
is and as far as I'm concerned is the
 
04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
last chance and I hope that they come up
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
with a good system so they can keep on
 
04:41:52.368 --> 04:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
running and serve the state and so for
 
04:41:55.310 --> 04:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
those reasons I will be supporting this
 
04:41:55.320 --> 04:41:56.990 align:start position:0%
those reasons I will be supporting this
bill

04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a comment yes
 
04:42:01.970 --> 04:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh when we passed
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
the bill to increase it for the 18
 
04:42:05.570 --> 04:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
months there was a big piece of the pie
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
missing uh that was what was requested
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and the house was an audit
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
and we got back a very thorough audit
 
04:42:15.530 --> 04:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
back on the plant and how it's running
 
04:42:17.930 --> 04:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're under a bad agreement that
 
04:42:19.610 --> 04:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's no fault of the legislature or
 
04:42:22.128 --> 04:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
anybody on the agreement that they have
 
04:42:25.010 --> 04:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
so we have a better idea of what's going
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
on there we didn't really have a good
 
04:42:29.330 --> 04:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
idea when we extended the 18 months and
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
now we do and and the energy Market has
 
04:42:33.410 --> 04:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
changed a lot to over the last 18 months
 
04:42:35.810 --> 04:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
so hopefully things will go good going
 
04:42:35.820 --> 04:42:37.368 align:start position:0%
so hopefully things will go good going
forward

04:42:37.368 --> 04:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:42:41.690 --> 04:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
comment thank you chair
 
04:42:44.090 --> 04:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
um I understand the importance of
 
04:42:46.750 --> 04:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
Burgess II New Hampshire's economy and
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
several Industries livelihoods what
 
04:42:52.730 --> 04:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
bothers me about this bill still and
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
I've talked to several people is that it
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
appears to be one law for one company
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
and it's it's not that's not something
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
that we're typically supposed to do
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
however if we support forgiveness
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
because of a dubious contract
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
I will support this bill but I'd like to
 
04:43:11.690 --> 04:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
see an amendment come out of this
 
04:43:13.368 --> 04:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
committee to forgive all New Hampshire
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
student debt that is based on dubious
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
further comments on this amendment
 
04:43:24.050 --> 04:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a comment
 
04:43:26.208 --> 04:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as far as this
 
04:43:28.368 --> 04:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
bill I kind of been going back and forth
 
04:43:30.368 --> 04:43:30.378 align:start position:0%
over it but
 
04:43:32.448 --> 04:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
knowing that I'm
 
04:43:34.610 --> 04:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
generally fiscally conservative I
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
believe in capitalism I believe in free
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
markets and Marketplace being able to
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
for a business to succeed or a business
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
to fail therefore in this case I have to
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee Tom
 
04:43:50.760 --> 04:43:52.910 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee Tom
closure

04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
closure
 
04:43:56.410 --> 04:43:56.420 align:start position:0%
thank you along with the previous
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
Committee Member
 
04:44:01.970 --> 04:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
I'm of the same mind but as running a
 
04:44:05.090 --> 04:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
business I know a lot of businesses out
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
there have put their capital in
 
04:44:10.610 --> 04:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
with the idea that this legislator has
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
kept it running I will support this
 
04:44:12.958 --> 04:44:14.030 align:start position:0%
kept it running I will support this
amendment

04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
and I would like to put into record that
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
the next St whenever this gets brought
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
up again with the Berlin plant
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
um there should be no more forgivenesses
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
because it's right players who are
 
04:44:30.410 --> 04:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
paying thank you additional comment on
 
04:44:31.730 --> 04:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
the question of the adoption of the
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Kelly
 
04:44:37.010 --> 04:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I I just like to
 
04:44:38.690 --> 04:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
say I'll be voting for the amendment as
 
04:44:38.700 --> 04:44:39.530 align:start position:0%
say I'll be voting for the amendment as
well

04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:44:40.850 --> 04:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
um it's not the amendment that I would
 
04:44:42.170 --> 04:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
have wanted but it's the amendment that
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
we got and I think it's a good step in
 
04:44:46.128 --> 04:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
the right direction in terms of the the
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
profitability of the plant the plant
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
produces power at eight cents a kilowatt
 
04:44:52.250 --> 04:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
hour and if you look at the default rate
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
right now it's 22 cents a kilowatt hour
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
they do not benefit from
 
04:44:58.010 --> 04:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
because their Market their energy is
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
sold on the day ahead Market they do not
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from the immense savings that
 
04:45:04.490 --> 04:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
eversource is getting by buying the
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
electricity from the plant so my you
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
know the idea this the CRF itself was
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
put in place was a was something that
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
this puc put into the contract to react
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
to the other biomass facilities in New
 
04:45:16.260 --> 04:45:17.330 align:start position:0%
to the other biomass facilities in New
Hampshire

04:45:17.330 --> 04:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
the it was a imposed uh part of the
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
agreement from the puc to defend rate
 
04:45:24.240 --> 04:45:25.550 align:start position:0%
agreement from the puc to defend rate
payers

04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
payers
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think that most rate payers
 
04:45:29.868 --> 04:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
would be an argument for the two to
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
three dollars a month in overcap charges
 
04:45:34.128 --> 04:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
that they are paying for the benefits
 
04:45:36.288 --> 04:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
that we get as were discussed by the
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
nhtoa and others here today I will be
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
voting for the amendment as I said I
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
wish we could get something better but I
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
can guarantee that we will have
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
something in front of our committee
 
04:45:47.030 --> 04:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
again because this bill just kicks the
 
04:45:50.770 --> 04:45:50.780 align:start position:0%
can down the road again thank you
 
04:45:53.690 --> 04:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a comment
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah a couple of comments uh I think my
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague there's a little
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
confused default service rate is a
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
retail rate that the electric utility
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
charges their customers they don't buy
 
04:46:05.930 --> 04:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
electricity at the default service rate
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
the wholesale rate is we talk right now
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the day ahead Market is 46.19 which
 
04:46:14.330 --> 04:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
is substantially below the 22 of the two
 
04:46:15.410 --> 04:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty dollars that you
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
would mention per megawatt hour so
 
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's the first config which a lot of
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
people have been confused about that
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
some of the people representing uh the
 
04:46:25.010 --> 04:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
plant where Berlin said that the default
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
service rate is not the same thing as
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
the wholesale rate this is a wholesale
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
generator they're in the wholesale
 
04:46:32.810 --> 04:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
Market they don't get paid on retail
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
rates nobody gets paid retail default
 
04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
Service rates no generator in the uh in
 
04:46:39.410 --> 04:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
New England does so and the second thing
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
is I guess what was just said I find
 
04:46:43.850 --> 04:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
extremely troubling because we've just
 
04:46:45.650 --> 04:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
been guaranteed that regardless of what
 
04:46:47.448 --> 04:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
happens here today they're going to be
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
back next year begging for more money
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
and if they don't get enough then
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
they'll be back the year after I think
 
04:46:54.890 --> 04:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
enough is enough it's time said we gave
 
04:46:57.288 --> 04:46:57.298 align:start position:0%
them 18 months they haven't done
 
04:46:58.730 --> 04:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
anything other than come up with another
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
plan for to give them more money I think
 
04:47:03.530 --> 04:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
this is it stop the bleeding now and
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill
 
04:47:05.638 --> 04:47:08.990 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill
foreign

04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:12.170 --> 04:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly has another one
 
04:47:13.930 --> 04:47:13.940 align:start position:0%
so at first I'd like to thank the
 
04:47:16.250 --> 04:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative for for correcting my my
 
04:47:16.260 --> 04:47:17.390 align:start position:0%
representative for for correcting my my
numbers

04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
um I guess my point is still that the
 
04:47:23.208 --> 04:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
margin on the electricity is very high
 
04:47:25.368 --> 04:47:25.378 align:start position:0%
it's higher than what the standard is
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
for the industry my my second comment
 
04:47:29.090 --> 04:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
would be that I don't speak for Burgess
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
biopower I am a citizen of Berlin and I
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm basing that off my understanding
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
of the situation
 
04:47:38.448 --> 04:47:38.458 align:start position:0%
the the idea that what I'm saying is
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we are again imposing another cap
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
into the CR this we're imposing the CRF
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the value of the facility which
 
04:47:50.690 --> 04:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
will lead to the exact problems that
 
04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
were outlined by the doe when they did
 
04:47:53.100 --> 04:47:54.490 align:start position:0%
were outlined by the doe when they did
their

04:47:54.490 --> 04:47:54.500 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
audit of the facility the Burgess
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
biopower is is run in a very efficient
 
04:48:00.240 --> 04:48:01.490 align:start position:0%
biopower is is run in a very efficient
way

04:48:01.490 --> 04:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:48:04.368 --> 04:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
and the idea that they are making
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
Handover fist for private investors or
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
for somebody else is not the case thank
 
04:48:09.120 --> 04:48:10.128 align:start position:0%
for somebody else is not the case thank
you

04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%

04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%

plant uh and
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
not necessarily pleased with what the
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
legislature did in the past
 
04:48:42.530 --> 04:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
but this particular bill I see as now
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
drawing a line saying
 
04:48:48.770 --> 04:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
the legislator legislature is now out of
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
this process
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
here's here's the deal
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
going forward it's in your court to
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
address the circumstances that you have
 
04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
so I will support the bill and nothing
 
04:49:03.060 --> 04:49:05.150 align:start position:0%

representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
chair um I just want to relay that um I
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
had I had a discussion with some of the
 
04:51:43.010 --> 04:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
representatives not representative
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
Representatives but some of the people
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
who represented the biomass and one of
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
my questions was what what guarantee do
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
we have that once this this uh debt is
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
Forgiven that they the CEO won't get a
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
big bonus or that they won't now sell
 
04:51:59.690 --> 04:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
the plant and
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I was assured that as much as
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
possible that that was not uh part of
 
04:52:07.730 --> 04:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
the picture and uh for me that that was
 
04:52:10.128 --> 04:52:10.138 align:start position:0%
important to know thank you
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Kelly
 
04:52:18.788 --> 04:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I would just add to that
 
04:52:22.490 --> 04:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the 100 million dollar CRF as it's
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
written in this bill it acts as a a
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
a piece against the sale price of the
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
facility so there is no value in selling
 
04:52:33.770 --> 04:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
the facility to the owners if that's the
 
04:52:36.410 --> 04:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
case the the other part I would add is
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
that nine years is the time span that
 
04:52:41.810 --> 04:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
was put forward if the pert plant was to
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
close it would take the koas county nine
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
years to recover from its closure so as
 
04:52:49.730 --> 04:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
a resident of kawas County who has lived
 
04:52:51.650 --> 04:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
their entire life inside of a recession
 
04:52:53.990 --> 04:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
inside of other recessions that the
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
country was going through I would ask
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
that you understand this in the context
 
04:53:00.368 --> 04:53:00.378 align:start position:0%
of the full situation these are people
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
like yourselves from one part of the
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
Town one part of the state and there are
 
04:53:07.368 --> 04:53:07.378 align:start position:0%
very few times where the state has the
 
04:53:09.770 --> 04:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
power to have such an enormous effect on
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
a single community so I would appreciate
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
your support on this bill and I would
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate on the understanding if this
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
issue is brought before this committee
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
additional comment on the question of
 
04:53:25.128 --> 04:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended representative
 
04:53:25.138 --> 04:53:26.448 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended representative

uh pricing is the actual problem that
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're having and knowing that if this
 
04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
did fail and they were forced to
 
04:53:44.330 --> 04:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy that this would more likely
 
04:53:46.250 --> 04:53:46.260 align:start position:0%

I'll start the discussion here
 
04:56:12.780 --> 04:56:14.090 align:start position:0%
I'll start the discussion here
because

04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
about two weeks ago I think it was I
 
04:56:18.890 --> 04:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
requested that the consider the
 
04:56:21.288 --> 04:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
committee consider reconsider this bill
 
04:56:25.090 --> 04:56:25.100 align:start position:0%
we'd originally judged it to be
 
04:56:27.890 --> 04:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and I asked the
 
04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
committee to reconsider it and offered
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
04:56:31.680 --> 04:56:32.810 align:start position:0%
an amendment
and

04:56:32.810 --> 04:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:34.730 --> 04:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
in the time that has passed since then
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions about the
 
04:56:36.240 --> 04:56:37.310 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions about the
amendment

04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
some suggested changes we couldn't come
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
to any agreement so for that reason
 
04:56:49.010 --> 04:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has decided to
 
04:56:52.970 --> 04:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
move itl on this bill and I concur with
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.010 --> 04:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the question of
 
04:57:02.030 --> 04:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.250 --> 04:57:04.260 align:start position:0%

to itl
 
04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I think that there is still
 
04:57:14.930 --> 04:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
important benefit to this bill
 
04:57:18.050 --> 04:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
particularly in allowing hosts or
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are neighboring each
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
other to share electrical generation
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
requirements I understand that the
 
04:57:29.570 --> 04:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
language extending this ability to
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
housing authorities and peas Air Force
 
04:57:34.610 --> 04:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
Base and quasi-public entities was not
 
04:57:38.208 --> 04:57:38.218 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the group so I have
 
04:57:40.490 --> 04:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
prepared another amendment that I would
 
04:57:42.288 --> 04:57:42.298 align:start position:0%
bring forward if we defeat the ital
 
04:57:44.090 --> 04:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
motion that would eliminate that
 
04:57:44.100 --> 04:57:45.948 align:start position:0%
motion that would eliminate that
language

04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%

representative Bernardi a second the
 
04:59:12.288 --> 04:59:12.298 align:start position:0%
motion it's moved and seconded that we
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill 139
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
I'll start the discussion by
 
04:59:19.550 --> 04:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
pointing out that we've already retained
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
12 bills so far this year we're going to
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
have to deal with all of those in
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
September October
 
04:59:29.390 --> 04:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's prudent for us to
 
04:59:32.690 --> 04:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
retain any more bills and so I will be
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
voting against the motion to retain
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%

and I think that it's certainly
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
something that I'd like to see again uh
 
04:59:56.570 --> 04:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunately weren't able to work
 
04:59:58.490 --> 04:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
out an amendment to make sure that both
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
sides agreed but I don't think that this
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
is something we would want to retain so
 
05:00:05.330 --> 05:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against retaining
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%

buy a vote of zero to twenty
 
05:01:47.330 --> 05:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain house bill
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
139 fails so this bill will go to the
 
05:01:55.490 --> 05:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Douglas Thomas will write
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
say again
 
05:02:09.470 --> 05:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
can we not make a motion for ought to
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.638 --> 05:02:15.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:02:15.410 --> 05:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:17.448 --> 05:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it would be productive
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
I don't think there'll be any
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
all right if you'd rather have it go to
 
05:02:30.050 --> 05:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
the floor as originally drafted that's
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
fine with me
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative partial thank you for
 
05:02:39.410 --> 05:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh recognizing me uh am I not uh
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
mistaken in my my mistake in my belief
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
that recently the uh house clerk has
 
05:02:46.610 --> 05:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
said we need to exp to examine all the
 
05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
options on a bill such as this even if
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
we do feel it's beyond productive to
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
take a further vote
 
05:02:56.448 --> 05:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
the house clerk said that if you come to
 
05:02:59.570 --> 05:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
a 1010 vote on one motion then you can
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
vote on retain
 
05:03:03.948 --> 05:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
if you come to 1010 on retain
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
then you can move on
 
05:03:09.410 --> 05:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes thank you
 
05:03:12.170 --> 05:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on
 
05:03:14.930 --> 05:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
um where were we
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
oh we were trying to figure out who's
 
05:03:18.288 --> 05:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:03:21.890 --> 05:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:25.310 --> 05:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
did the return yeah right okay so we're
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're with at the without recommendation
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
stage and representative Thomas will
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
write the case for itl who will write
 
05:03:35.570 --> 05:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
the case representative McWilliams for
 
05:03:37.550 --> 05:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
um and that's representative Doug Thomas
 
05:03:39.708 --> 05:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
we'll write that Doug Thomas correct
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Christian will and
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Christian will write the
 
05:03:46.128 --> 05:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
case for ought to pass
 
05:03:46.138 --> 05:03:47.628 align:start position:0%

way down to line 34.
 
05:27:50.090 --> 05:27:50.100 align:start position:0%

I should say
 
05:28:12.530 --> 05:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it in lines one
 
05:28:12.540 --> 05:28:14.810 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it in lines one
through

05:28:14.810 --> 05:28:14.820 align:start position:0%

05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
it says that the governor with consent
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the council shall appoint five public
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
members to serve on proceedings as
 
05:28:26.090 --> 05:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
prescribed in this section
 
05:28:28.250 --> 05:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
and that all the public members shall
 
05:28:30.170 --> 05:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
constitute a pool from which the
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
department shall draw and I want you to
 
05:28:35.270 --> 05:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
remember that because later on
 
05:28:35.280 --> 05:28:37.128 align:start position:0%
remember that because later on
will

05:28:37.128 --> 05:28:37.138 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'll go over the text that shows how
 
05:28:41.390 --> 05:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
those public members get added to a
 
05:28:41.400 --> 05:28:46.670 align:start position:0%
those public members get added to a
proceeding

05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
if you go down to
 
05:28:52.128 --> 05:28:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.490 --> 05:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
section d the public members shall be
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
compensated for all time spent on
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
commission business including
 
05:29:00.590 --> 05:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
compensation and reimbursement for
 
05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
energy facility preceding time and
 
05:29:02.400 --> 05:29:03.708 align:start position:0%
energy facility preceding time and
expenses

05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
05:29:06.170 --> 05:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
compensation shall be provided on a pro
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
rata basis based on the daily salary
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
rate of an unclassified position at the
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
initial step in grade FF under RSA 94
 
05:29:20.230 --> 05:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:23.628 --> 05:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.090 --> 05:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
now that is exactly the same rate of pay
 
05:29:28.670 --> 05:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
that a site evaluation Committee Member
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
gets today under RSA
 
05:29:36.770 --> 05:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.530 --> 05:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
the next major change go down to
 
05:29:41.810 --> 05:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
turn to page five and go down to line
 
05:29:41.820 --> 05:29:45.530 align:start position:0%
turn to page five and go down to line
36.

05:29:45.530 --> 05:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.690 --> 05:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of an application the
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
commission shall inform All State
 
05:29:53.930 --> 05:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
agencies of such application and invite
 
05:29:56.570 --> 05:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
their participation in the preceding
 
05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
convened to consider the application
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
now this text is important because
 
05:30:02.400 --> 05:30:04.010 align:start position:0%
now this text is important because
previously

05:30:04.010 --> 05:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
previously
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that only
 
05:30:09.650 --> 05:30:09.660 align:start position:0%
agencies that had permitting
 
05:30:13.250 --> 05:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility would be invited to join
 
05:30:17.208 --> 05:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
in SEC proceeding but this text makes it
 
05:30:17.218 --> 05:30:18.170 align:start position:0%
in SEC proceeding but this text makes it
clear

05:30:18.170 --> 05:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
that any state agency
 
05:30:23.628 --> 05:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
whether it has permitting responsibility
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:30:27.650 --> 05:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
should be informed of a proceeding and
 
05:30:29.628 --> 05:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
can make comments on that proceeding if
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
a church so chooses can participate if
 
05:30:37.070 --> 05:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.610 --> 05:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.670 --> 05:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
now we're going to skip to page nine
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
which is the section on application and
 
05:30:50.930 --> 05:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
filing fees
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
this was a section that generated a lot
 
05:30:54.890 --> 05:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
of comment and a lot of questions from
 
05:30:57.170 --> 05:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:30:58.730 --> 05:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the section that
 
05:31:03.948 --> 05:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.850 --> 05:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
this section revises the
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
charges for various Energy Systems
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's much different and much simpler
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
than what was there before and I think
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
you'll agree it looks
 
05:31:24.288 --> 05:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.890 --> 05:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
the next change is down on line 28
 
05:31:29.628 --> 05:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
this was a change suggested by
 
05:31:32.208 --> 05:31:32.218 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
05:31:32.218 --> 05:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
previously

05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
previously
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
there was we discussing these as we go
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
along we're going to wait until we go
 
05:31:40.250 --> 05:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing
 
05:31:42.288 --> 05:31:42.298 align:start position:0%
you can discuss them now if you like
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
um I have a question then representative
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a Crest question these I
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
see that you change the amount uh that's
 
05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
being charged and my understanding that
 
05:31:54.288 --> 05:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
they the way they are in now was based
 
05:31:58.490 --> 05:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
on a estimate of cost uh associated with
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
each different type of thing whereas a
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know a 10 megawatt wind plant would
 
05:32:05.150 --> 05:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
probably take the same amount as of time
 
05:32:08.770 --> 05:32:08.780 align:start position:0%
as a 200 or 300 megawatt natural gas
 
05:32:08.780 --> 05:32:10.628 align:start position:0%
as a 200 or 300 megawatt natural gas
plant

05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
plant
 
05:32:13.250 --> 05:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
these new numbers based on something or
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
is it just an attempt to make prices
 
05:32:17.208 --> 05:32:17.218 align:start position:0%
lower and will they uh be substantial
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
enough to cover the funding of the site
 
05:32:21.708 --> 05:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question the bulk of
 
05:32:25.850 --> 05:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
the charge is the base charge the sixty
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar base charge and the
 
05:32:29.868 --> 05:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollar certificate and a
 
05:32:31.490 --> 05:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
compliance charge
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
so the per megawatt charges are
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
additional to that and
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
upon analysis it looks like these
 
05:32:45.128 --> 05:32:45.138 align:start position:0%
numbers will be adequate
 
05:32:47.208 --> 05:32:47.218 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
05:32:50.570 --> 05:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
the application fee charges
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
if they're not
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
will know that pretty quickly once uh
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
once this legislation goes into effect
 
05:33:04.550 --> 05:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that fairness is
 
05:33:09.288 --> 05:33:09.298 align:start position:0%
the major issue here and the major
 
05:33:09.298 --> 05:33:12.830 align:start position:0%
the major issue here and the major
question

05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:16.128 --> 05:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
any further questions about that
 
05:33:17.930 --> 05:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Christian are you happy
 
05:33:20.930 --> 05:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
with that change
 
05:33:22.730 --> 05:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
my goodness yes thank you for checking
 
05:33:26.330 --> 05:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.250 --> 05:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
so then representative Kelly do you have
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
a question yeah I just uh I believe
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas serves on the
 
05:33:34.128 --> 05:33:34.138 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy study commission I didn't
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
know if they had any insight on if
 
05:33:38.330 --> 05:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
there's a difference in
 
05:33:40.010 --> 05:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
things that they're looking at that that
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
05:33:43.490 --> 05:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
for that nuclear which representative
 
05:33:45.350 --> 05:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
Thomas oh
 
05:33:48.590 --> 05:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
no no I I do not officially serve on it
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
I representative Harrington does
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
well it's ongoing uh one thing I was
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
just giving on a question is I'm not
 
05:33:57.050 --> 05:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
even sure the state has any regulatory
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
authority over nuclear generation that's
 
05:34:01.970 --> 05:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
exclusively the purview the NRC and I'm
 
05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
not sure if we didn't issue was permit
 
05:34:05.810 --> 05:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
it would mean anything because that's
 
05:34:07.610 --> 05:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
been taken up in court a number of times
 
05:34:10.490 --> 05:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
and the Pu the NRC has exclusive rights
 
05:34:12.890 --> 05:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
for licensing nuclear plants
 
05:34:12.900 --> 05:34:15.708 align:start position:0%
for licensing nuclear plants
okay

05:34:15.708 --> 05:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:34:19.550 --> 05:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
all right so going to line 28 the amount
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the fee schedule can be increased or
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
decreased by up to five percent that's a
 
05:34:28.970 --> 05:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
change it was 20 in the previous
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
iteration of um
 
05:34:34.368 --> 05:34:34.378 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and that was a
 
05:34:37.010 --> 05:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
suggested change by representative
 
05:34:39.470 --> 05:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
McWilliams who thought 20 sounded kind
 
05:34:42.890 --> 05:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.368 --> 05:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
next page 10 starting at line one and
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
going all the way down to Line 34. This
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
is the
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
section that discussions discusses the
 
05:34:55.250 --> 05:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's role the council
 
05:34:57.470 --> 05:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
for the public this role
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice and the office
 
05:35:04.190 --> 05:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
the real important
 
05:35:08.090 --> 05:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
all of this text is is slightly
 
05:35:10.610 --> 05:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
different but the real important text
 
05:35:12.590 --> 05:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
that you should examine carefully is
 
05:35:14.570 --> 05:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
line five
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
the sentence that this says the
 
05:35:19.128 --> 05:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
department shall appoint two members of
 
05:35:22.368 --> 05:35:22.378 align:start position:0%
the public to serve on all proceedings
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
from the pool of candidates described in
 
05:35:29.390 --> 05:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 363 d42 which we went over a little
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
while ago
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
so this is where
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
the two public members would be added to
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
and there is some text further on that
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss about
 
05:35:47.208 --> 05:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
uh what those public members role would
 
05:35:47.218 --> 05:35:52.368 align:start position:0%
uh what those public members role would
be

05:35:52.368 --> 05:35:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.770 --> 05:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
another important piece of text to look
 
05:35:56.690 --> 05:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
at here is
 
05:36:00.708 --> 05:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
lines 10 and 11. question Mr chairman
 
05:36:02.930 --> 05:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
before you move on yes representative
 
05:36:04.670 --> 05:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
Reynolds you have a question
 
05:36:09.610 --> 05:36:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
the um I'm sorry if maybe you weren't
 
05:36:14.810 --> 05:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
there I was going to draw attention to
 
05:36:17.050 --> 05:36:17.060 align:start position:0%
line 11 where you
 
05:36:19.550 --> 05:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you've changed language
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
to say the Attorney General shallow
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
point an Assistant Attorney General
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's about what I was just about to go
 
05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
away but but it's preface by the at the
 
05:36:32.170 --> 05:36:32.180 align:start position:0%
requests of the department sorry
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes and that's a necessary change
 
05:36:35.040 --> 05:36:36.670 align:start position:0%
yes and that's a necessary change
because

05:36:36.670 --> 05:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
05:36:42.970 --> 05:36:42.980 align:start position:0%
when it gets an application
 
05:36:46.128 --> 05:36:46.138 align:start position:0%
uh notifies the commissioner of the
 
05:36:47.330 --> 05:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the attorney
 
05:36:50.030 --> 05:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
general and the consumer addict advocate
 
05:36:51.708 --> 05:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
of all proceedings
 
05:36:53.448 --> 05:36:53.458 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to the Department of
 
05:36:55.850 --> 05:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
energy to decide
 
05:36:59.208 --> 05:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
how best to
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
determine how to represent the public
 
05:37:04.490 --> 05:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
and if they determine that an attorney
 
05:37:06.530 --> 05:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
general is needed to represent the
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
public which they probably would in most
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
big proceedings
 
05:37:12.590 --> 05:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
but probably would not in small
 
05:37:15.288 --> 05:37:15.298 align:start position:0%
proceedings then the department can
 
05:37:17.890 --> 05:37:17.900 align:start position:0%
request that an attorney general
 
05:37:20.690 --> 05:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
be appointed and if that request is made
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
then the Attorney General must appoint
 
05:37:27.650 --> 05:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
that Assistant Attorney General
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
and answer your question
 
05:37:32.930 --> 05:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
wondering I suppose in your remarks they
 
05:37:37.128 --> 05:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
just said if it was a small one he might
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
not but if it was a large one we
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:45.230 --> 05:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
would prefer if it wasn't conditional
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
like that if it just
 
05:37:52.970 --> 05:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
then it that a a public Council was
 
05:37:55.190 --> 05:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
always appointed
 
05:37:57.230 --> 05:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
well if a public Council was appointed
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
to a proceeding where it turned out that
 
05:38:02.690 --> 05:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
he or she was not needed that would
 
05:38:05.570 --> 05:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
involve some additional expense
 
05:38:05.580 --> 05:38:07.190 align:start position:0%
involve some additional expense
so

05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
one of the goals of this legislation is
 
05:38:13.310 --> 05:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
to reduce costs whenever possible in the
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and then there's a new uh
 
05:38:21.948 --> 05:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead I have a question going
 
05:38:24.350 --> 05:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
back to line five
 
05:38:26.810 --> 05:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
about the appointing of two members so
 
05:38:29.330 --> 05:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
this is out of the pool of five and it's
 
05:38:31.788 --> 05:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
that the the department appoints the two
 
05:38:31.798 --> 05:38:33.410 align:start position:0%
that the the department appoints the two
members

05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:38:35.330 --> 05:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
um it seems that we could have a
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
situation where the department says well
 
05:38:38.570 --> 05:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
there are two that we like and three
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we're not so keen on and they just
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
keep reappointing the same too is there
 
05:38:44.330 --> 05:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
any language that that actually makes
 
05:38:46.490 --> 05:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
sure that that everybody in the pool has
 
05:38:49.128 --> 05:38:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
rotating pool members there is no
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
language that provides for that but the
 
05:38:55.550 --> 05:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
reason there are five members in the
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
pool is because there is likely to be a
 
05:39:02.050 --> 05:39:02.060 align:start position:0%
case or a situation where there are two
 
05:39:04.310 --> 05:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
application proceedings going on
 
05:39:04.320 --> 05:39:06.230 align:start position:0%
application proceedings going on
simultaneously

05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
05:39:09.050 --> 05:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
so you need a big pool in order to find
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
two public members you couldn't ask the
 
05:39:13.628 --> 05:39:13.638 align:start position:0%
same two public members to serve on both
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
applications or at both proceedings that
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be too much
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
work for them so uh
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
you you create a pool of five and this
 
05:39:26.990 --> 05:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
is the way it worked under RSA 162h and
 
05:39:30.050 --> 05:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
then from that you extract members as
 
05:39:32.690 --> 05:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
necessary for a proceeding
 
05:39:36.288 --> 05:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question okay
 
05:39:39.770 --> 05:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
down on line 29 this is a new paragraph
 
05:39:43.070 --> 05:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
that was added to make sure that the
 
05:39:45.170 --> 05:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice can be reimbursed
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
for any time that it spends on an energy
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:53.930 --> 05:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
and this is language that pretty much
 
05:39:57.770 --> 05:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
came from RSA 162h as well
 
05:40:00.770 --> 05:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
05:40:03.650 --> 05:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
so the wording on line 29
 
05:40:03.660 --> 05:40:08.030 align:start position:0%
so the wording on line 29
is

05:40:08.030 --> 05:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
missile Justice gets reimbursed for
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
preceding time expenses by any associate
 
05:40:14.990 --> 05:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general with respect to any
 
05:40:17.570 --> 05:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
application or other proceeding so far
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm with you concerning an energy
 
05:40:19.920 --> 05:40:21.170 align:start position:0%
I'm with you concerning an energy
facility

05:40:21.170 --> 05:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:40:23.930 --> 05:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
and then the last couple of words shall
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
not be subject to reimbursement that
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't really jive with the rest of the
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
sentence it doesn't really make sense
 
05:40:34.850 --> 05:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying and uh that
 
05:40:38.810 --> 05:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
does look
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
see if I can try to parse this sentence
 
05:40:46.610 --> 05:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
although to uh representative Reynold's
 
05:40:51.410 --> 05:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
earlier comments
 
05:40:52.970 --> 05:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that you need to request
 
05:40:54.410 --> 05:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
energy to approve the Attorney General
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
appointing an Assistant Attorney General
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
if this is going to be reimbursed by the
 
05:41:01.080 --> 05:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
if this is going to be reimbursed by the
applicant

05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
applicant
 
05:41:04.430 --> 05:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
I would say that it makes sense to just
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
have an Assistant Attorney General on
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
even dockets where they're not needed
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think they're probably needed on every
 
05:41:14.400 --> 05:41:16.190 align:start position:0%
I think they're probably needed on every
docket

05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
docket
 
05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
it may be limited time need shouldn't
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
somebody be be looking at that question
 
05:41:22.490 --> 05:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
though and deciding before
 
05:41:23.810 --> 05:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
that's what the department of energy
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
will do
 
05:41:28.250 --> 05:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
I I would disagree I would say that this
 
05:41:30.050 --> 05:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
um the role of the Assistant Attorney
 
05:41:30.060 --> 05:41:32.208 align:start position:0%
um the role of the Assistant Attorney
General

05:41:32.208 --> 05:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
General
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um which is obviously assisting in the
 
05:41:36.350 --> 05:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
proceeding and Advising the commissioner
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the department I would say that role
 
05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
is necessary for each SEC proceeding
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
so you understand don't you that the
 
05:41:45.110 --> 05:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
role of the Attorney General would be
 
05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
simply to interpret
 
05:41:50.270 --> 05:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
legal language
 
05:41:52.010 --> 05:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
on the proceeding
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be taking an advocacy
 
05:41:55.610 --> 05:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
position on
 
05:41:58.490 --> 05:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
any issue it would strictly be there to
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
interpret legal language
 
05:42:03.288 --> 05:42:03.298 align:start position:0%
okay so this Harkens back to a previous
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment we looked at where the
 
05:42:06.650 --> 05:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's Assistant Attorney
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
General was going to be a public
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
Advocate and that's been taken out of
 
05:42:17.288 --> 05:42:17.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
so it says at the request of the
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department the
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General shall appoint an
 
05:42:24.530 --> 05:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General to advise the
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department and
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
so if it's paid Council from the
 
05:42:35.448 --> 05:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the Department of
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
Justice and offers Office of the
 
05:42:39.650 --> 05:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate shall be recorded All
 
05:42:41.390 --> 05:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
rights and privileges
 
05:42:43.510 --> 05:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities of an attorney
 
05:42:45.708 --> 05:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
representing a party in formal action
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
and Shall Serve until the decision to
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
issue or deny a certificate is final
 
05:42:56.090 --> 05:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
so that's language that says the council
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
will be all of these councils will be
 
05:42:58.440 --> 05:43:03.288 align:start position:0%
will be all of these councils will be
advocates

05:43:03.288 --> 05:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.810 --> 05:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman is is the term public
 
05:43:08.448 --> 05:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
counsel in
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I think that's
 
05:43:12.288 --> 05:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
what we're getting at
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
the previous the original
 
05:43:18.410 --> 05:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
Bill had something like somebody May
 
05:43:20.270 --> 05:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
appoint a public counsel
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
and one of our our feeling was that we
 
05:43:24.770 --> 05:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be shall appoint a public
 
05:43:24.780 --> 05:43:26.270 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be shall appoint a public
counsel

05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
05:43:26.280 --> 05:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
counsel
VES

05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:31.368 --> 05:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
there is no definition of public counsel
 
05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
in the in section two if that was your
 
05:43:34.378 --> 05:43:43.030 align:start position:0%
in the in section two if that was your
question

05:43:43.030 --> 05:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:48.240 --> 05:43:49.850 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:43:49.850 --> 05:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
I just read that sentence a minute ago
 
05:43:52.320 --> 05:43:55.250 align:start position:0%
I just read that sentence a minute ago
so

05:43:55.250 --> 05:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Krishan has a question
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
um going back to um
 
05:44:04.128 --> 05:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
I don't know paragraph four
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about the doj being
 
05:44:05.760 --> 05:44:07.070 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about the doj being
reimbursed

05:44:07.070 --> 05:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
05:44:09.048 --> 05:44:09.058 align:start position:0%
um does that section need to have any
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
language about where that reimbursement
 
05:44:13.850 --> 05:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
comes from is it from the the fund from
 
05:44:15.948 --> 05:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
the actual petitioner or is that
 
05:44:18.650 --> 05:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
clarified elsewhere
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
that was clarified in section D4
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
where it said that the reimbursement
 
05:44:30.670 --> 05:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
just getting back to this thing with the
 
05:44:37.070 --> 05:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
council I understand what people are
 
05:44:39.170 --> 05:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
trying to say the there is no definition
 
05:44:41.570 --> 05:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
of public counsel but I can assure you
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
that there's has been a council who was
 
05:44:47.690 --> 05:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
acting for the public his job was to
 
05:44:50.090 --> 05:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
represent the general public and not be
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
as it could be interpreted here a legal
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
advisor to the Department of energy or
 
05:44:56.270 --> 05:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
the commission but rather an advocate
 
05:44:58.610 --> 05:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
for the general public and I think that
 
05:45:00.048 --> 05:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarified in this because
 
05:45:02.030 --> 05:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
that would be a change of what's being
 
05:45:03.830 --> 05:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
done presently which has been done in
 
05:45:10.330 --> 05:45:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
who's the legal attorney for the
 
05:45:15.830 --> 05:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
05:45:18.350 --> 05:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
might help clarify some of this language
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr shulock for being here
 
05:45:24.470 --> 05:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
today good afternoon and thank you for
 
05:45:26.030 --> 05:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
so with regard to paragraph four that
 
05:45:31.010 --> 05:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
funny language
 
05:45:34.190 --> 05:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
I didn't draft this but I suspect that
 
05:45:36.288 --> 05:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
everything after the comma where it says
 
05:45:39.110 --> 05:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
with respect to any application or other
 
05:45:39.120 --> 05:45:40.250 align:start position:0%
with respect to any application or other
proceeding

05:45:40.250 --> 05:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
05:45:47.090 --> 05:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.090 --> 05:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
so I think that is holdover language
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
from the current provision which did not
 
05:45:56.930 --> 05:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
reimburse anybody for the first three
 
05:45:58.490 --> 05:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
days of their work
 
05:46:00.890 --> 05:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
and it's surplusage so I think
 
05:46:03.470 --> 05:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
everything after the comma after
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general should be stricken
 
05:46:08.208 --> 05:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
so that they're reimbursed for all of
 
05:46:15.048 --> 05:46:15.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.058 --> 05:46:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:46:16.610 --> 05:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington I
 
05:46:21.170 --> 05:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
think just as a follow-up to what I was
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
referring to was in the upper part of
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
that page on line 11 and 12. it you talk
 
05:46:28.730 --> 05:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
about appointment uh attorney general
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
shall appointed an Assistant Attorney
 
05:46:32.448 --> 05:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
General to advise the commissioner of
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
the department and assist the department
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
on any proceeding again it sounds like
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're appointing a legal advisor to the
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to advise them on
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
the legalities of going forward and
 
05:46:45.288 --> 05:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
that's substantially different than what
 
05:46:47.448 --> 05:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
we do now and we have none in the past
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
where we had a public Council who was
 
05:46:51.170 --> 05:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
basically there to represent the rights
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the public so so that's that's that's
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
a pretty big change
 
05:46:59.708 --> 05:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman if if I'm representative
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
Reynolds I'm looking at them side by
 
05:47:04.850 --> 05:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
side your original bill and the and the
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have now and and they
 
05:47:09.530 --> 05:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
they do look the same I think the
 
05:47:11.448 --> 05:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
confusion perhaps is
 
05:47:13.368 --> 05:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
the section is headed
 
05:47:15.470 --> 05:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and Council for the
 
05:47:17.448 --> 05:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
public and it's capitalized as if it is
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
a I think what Mr what representative
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington is saying there was this
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
person who was counsel for the public
 
05:47:27.650 --> 05:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
so that's good
 
05:47:31.730 --> 05:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
but I to reiterate I guess what um
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams was saying I
 
05:47:36.590 --> 05:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
think my feeling is that you don't not
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
be optional uh or only at the request of
 
05:47:41.208 --> 05:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department that
 
05:47:43.670 --> 05:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
that such a person would be appointed
 
05:47:46.128 --> 05:47:46.138 align:start position:0%
if I may be so bold as to ask Mr shulock
 
05:47:49.730 --> 05:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
so I I think that the effect of this
 
05:47:52.128 --> 05:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
section is that it gives to the
 
05:47:53.690 --> 05:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of energy
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
the duty to decide how the Public's
 
05:47:58.730 --> 05:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
interest is best represented with regard
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
to those two matters now that might be
 
05:48:05.330 --> 05:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
best represented by having a council for
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
the public appointed from the Attorney
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
General's office to assist it might just
 
05:48:12.288 --> 05:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
be having the department staff
 
05:48:15.170 --> 05:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
do it in certain cases where the full
 
05:48:16.850 --> 05:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
participation of the Attorney General's
 
05:48:19.490 --> 05:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
office is not necessary so there are
 
05:48:22.010 --> 05:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
instances where
 
05:48:22.020 --> 05:48:23.570 align:start position:0%
instances where
um

05:48:23.570 --> 05:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:27.230 --> 05:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
the let's say the environment for a
 
05:48:29.150 --> 05:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
particular project is adequately
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
protected by the agencies that have uh
 
05:48:35.330 --> 05:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
permitting Authority and and there is no
 
05:48:37.970 --> 05:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
open issue that they don't cover that
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be covered by somebody else
 
05:48:40.080 --> 05:48:41.810 align:start position:0%
needs to be covered by somebody else
right

05:48:41.810 --> 05:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
um if there were an open issue that
 
05:48:46.190 --> 05:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
needed to be covered the commissioner
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
would identify that he would ask the
 
05:48:52.690 --> 05:48:52.700 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to appoint a council
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
to handle that if necessary
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
and would hire all of the expert
 
05:49:02.690 --> 05:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
Services necessary to to follow that
 
05:49:04.970 --> 05:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
issue through the entire process
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
so it it adds a little additional
 
05:49:11.090 --> 05:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the process but it is all
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
aimed at protecting the Public's
 
05:49:13.200 --> 05:49:14.208 align:start position:0%
aimed at protecting the Public's
interest

05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:49:19.368 --> 05:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
any further comment on this section or
 
05:49:29.570 --> 05:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:29.580 --> 05:49:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:49:31.670 --> 05:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
next session I want section I want to
 
05:49:37.610 --> 05:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to is
 
05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
starting with
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
The End of Line 10 it says
 
05:49:51.048 --> 05:49:51.058 align:start position:0%
the decision to issue a certificate in
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
its final form
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
or to deny an application once it has
 
05:49:58.010 --> 05:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
been accepted shall be made by a
 
05:50:00.650 --> 05:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission and its
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.548 --> 05:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
so that's how the two public members
 
05:50:09.470 --> 05:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
come into play in the decision-making
 
05:50:09.480 --> 05:50:13.310 align:start position:0%
come into play in the decision-making
process

05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
question on that yes go ahead
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
um it sounds to be a little bit uh
 
05:50:21.470 --> 05:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
confusing because you could take it to
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
say that it is a majority of the
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
commission and then a majority of the
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
public members
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm not quite sure if one public
 
05:50:31.850 --> 05:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
member voted against it one in favor of
 
05:50:34.010 --> 05:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
it would that stop the project why don't
 
05:50:35.930 --> 05:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
we just sense the public members our
 
05:50:37.310 --> 05:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
members of the commission why do we even
 
05:50:39.048 --> 05:50:39.058 align:start position:0%
have to add public members and just say
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission or is it
 
05:50:43.548 --> 05:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
intended to have give a veto power to
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
each of the public members
 
05:50:47.948 --> 05:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
the reason that language was was
 
05:50:50.750 --> 05:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
constructed the way it was is because if
 
05:50:53.090 --> 05:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
we left it at majority of the commission
 
05:50:55.610 --> 05:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
then that would allow the commission to
 
05:50:57.230 --> 05:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
exclude the opinion of the public
 
05:50:57.240 --> 05:50:58.490 align:start position:0%
exclude the opinion of the public
members

05:50:58.490 --> 05:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
by adding and its public members that
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
tells the commission that its vote has
 
05:51:07.250 --> 05:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
to include the public members
 
05:51:09.410 --> 05:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
and since there's no comma after the
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
word commission
 
05:51:12.770 --> 05:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean a majority of the
 
05:51:12.780 --> 05:51:15.590 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean a majority of the
commission

05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
and its public members
 
05:51:19.610 --> 05:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
05:51:21.770 --> 05:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
the majority doesn't have to be the
 
05:51:23.150 --> 05:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission and the
 
05:51:24.770 --> 05:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
majority of the public members because
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's only two public members the
 
05:51:28.430 --> 05:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
majority would be
 
05:51:28.440 --> 05:51:30.470 align:start position:0%
majority would be
unanimous

05:51:30.470 --> 05:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
but it's that's not required it's a it's
 
05:51:36.770 --> 05:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
a majority of the five members
 
05:51:39.530 --> 05:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
that is required so three to two would
 
05:51:45.530 --> 05:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
be the the minimum vote to either
 
05:51:48.110 --> 05:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
deny an application or accept an
 
05:51:50.930 --> 05:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
application or an issue a certificate it
 
05:51:54.410 --> 05:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up I just I think it is
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
redundant and confusing because
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole thing we talk about
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
the commission shell the commission
 
05:52:01.850 --> 05:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
shall require the commission shall
 
05:52:03.650 --> 05:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
conduct we don't say the commission and
 
05:52:05.690 --> 05:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
the public members shall the implication
 
05:52:08.030 --> 05:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
is the commission is made up of whoever
 
05:52:09.708 --> 05:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
I don't even know who the other members
 
05:52:12.048 --> 05:52:12.058 align:start position:0%
are at this point but plus the public
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
members so to pull it out like that
 
05:52:16.010 --> 05:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
makes it sound like we're treating him
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
differently when it comes to the vote
 
05:52:19.490 --> 05:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
whereas in fact we don't we should use
 
05:52:21.288 --> 05:52:21.298 align:start position:0%
it consistently or just say the
 
05:52:22.970 --> 05:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
commission with the understanding that
 
05:52:24.770 --> 05:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
the commission is made up of the
 
05:52:26.570 --> 05:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
whatever department heads plus two
 
05:52:28.190 --> 05:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
public members
 
05:52:30.410 --> 05:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
05:52:33.470 --> 05:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I don't think it matters
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
what we think the words mean I can can
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
we ask our attorney here uh in terms of
 
05:52:42.890 --> 05:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
legal terms uh how that most likely
 
05:52:55.070 --> 05:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.770 --> 05:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
the attorney answered is I don't really
 
05:52:59.690 --> 05:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
know how a court would interpret that
 
05:53:01.970 --> 05:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
but but
 
05:53:04.970 --> 05:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
um I think there is some truth on both
 
05:53:04.980 --> 05:53:06.250 align:start position:0%
um I think there is some truth on both
sides

05:53:06.250 --> 05:53:06.260 align:start position:0%
sides
 
05:53:09.530 --> 05:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
that normally when you use a term you
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
should use it consistently throughout
 
05:53:13.850 --> 05:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
otherwise people will think that you
 
05:53:15.650 --> 05:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
mean something different
 
05:53:17.990 --> 05:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
when you use a different setup of a term
 
05:53:21.708 --> 05:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
okay but the logic that you you can't
 
05:53:24.548 --> 05:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
have a majority of two
 
05:53:27.170 --> 05:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
I think would hold and it would be a 3-2
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
vote I think that's the most likely
 
05:53:29.280 --> 05:53:33.350 align:start position:0%
vote I think that's the most likely
outcome

05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:35.090 --> 05:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
we have another attorney in the room
 
05:53:37.610 --> 05:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with clarifying it though
 
05:53:46.610 --> 05:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:48.230 --> 05:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
you might just put a period after
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
majority sometimes less is more
 
05:53:51.600 --> 05:53:52.610 align:start position:0%
majority sometimes less is more
right

05:53:52.610 --> 05:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
so you have five people on the panel a
 
05:53:59.868 --> 05:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's one way to handle it another way
 
05:54:05.690 --> 05:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
to handle it might say majority of the
 
05:54:06.890 --> 05:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
commission and its public members
 
05:54:06.900 --> 05:54:10.368 align:start position:0%
commission and its public members
combined

05:54:10.368 --> 05:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:12.830 --> 05:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
and its public members combined so just
 
05:54:14.930 --> 05:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
to add the word combined after yes
 
05:54:14.940 --> 05:54:18.890 align:start position:0%
to add the word combined after yes
members

05:54:18.890 --> 05:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:20.330 --> 05:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
the reason I think it's important to
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
make a distinction here is because
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
the public members
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
are part of a proceeding but they are
 
05:54:31.250 --> 05:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:31.260 --> 05:54:34.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:54:34.010 --> 05:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:36.110 --> 05:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to distinguish
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
between the commission and its public
 
05:54:40.128 --> 05:54:40.138 align:start position:0%
members for that reason
 
05:54:42.530 --> 05:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
then if you've followed that logic then
 
05:54:45.048 --> 05:54:45.058 align:start position:0%
I think the word combined would work
 
05:54:46.850 --> 05:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
combined would work
 
05:54:48.830 --> 05:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
we do have another attorney who might
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
have an opinion on this in the room
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
that's Meredith Hatfield Miss Hatfield
 
05:54:59.690 --> 05:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.368 --> 05:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
turn on the mic please thank you so much
 
05:55:03.590 --> 05:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos for letting me speak at
 
05:55:05.510 --> 05:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
this particular moment I had a couple of
 
05:55:07.368 --> 05:55:07.378 align:start position:0%
questions this was one of them
 
05:55:13.010 --> 05:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
so in rsa's 162 H3 that in the original
 
05:55:15.288 --> 05:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
current statute it creates the site
 
05:55:17.690 --> 05:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and I think you might need as someone
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
just said a definition because the
 
05:55:27.410 --> 05:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
commission the puc will continue to
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
exist with all of its duties
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
so by adding public members you're kind
 
05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
of creating a new citing body a reformed
 
05:55:38.090 --> 05:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
citing body so there are several places
 
05:55:40.368 --> 05:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
in this amendment that refer to the
 
05:55:43.010 --> 05:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
commission and the way I'm reading it I
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
think you intend to include the
 
05:55:46.490 --> 05:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
commission and the public members
 
05:55:49.970 --> 05:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
so the cleanest thing might be to
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
have a new name for this body or just
 
05:55:55.730 --> 05:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
call it the site evaluation committee
 
05:55:55.740 --> 05:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
call it the site evaluation committee
um

05:55:56.510 --> 05:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:58.490 --> 05:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
in its new form
 
05:56:01.128 --> 05:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
because there are several sections where
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
it says the commission shall issue an
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
order the commission or any certificate
 
05:56:08.448 --> 05:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
issued by the commission shall be based
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
on the record and the way I'm reading
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
this I think you mean the commission and
 
05:56:17.770 --> 05:56:17.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:19.970 --> 05:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for that could the definition
 
05:56:21.470 --> 05:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
of commission
 
05:56:24.830 --> 05:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
in section 2 be changed
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
to mean commission means the Public
 
05:56:29.330 --> 05:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
05:56:33.350 --> 05:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
augmented by two public members
 
05:56:33.360 --> 05:56:37.730 align:start position:0%
augmented by two public members
already

05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
I think it I
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
would want to hear from the commission
 
05:56:42.770 --> 05:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
um because I think it might be confusing
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
given that Commission
 
05:56:52.368 --> 05:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
in this section of our statutes
 
05:56:55.490 --> 05:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
refers to the puc you know wearing its
 
05:56:57.770 --> 05:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
other hats if you will so it might lead
 
05:57:01.850 --> 05:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you sure and I would
 
05:57:07.310 --> 05:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
love to have the opportunity to ask a
 
05:57:08.510 --> 05:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
couple other questions at the right
 
05:57:08.520 --> 05:57:09.770 align:start position:0%
couple other questions at the right
moment

05:57:09.770 --> 05:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
moment
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
okay at the right moment
 
05:57:14.628 --> 05:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
05:57:23.090 --> 05:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.030 --> 05:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
numbers for committee and then reference
 
05:57:28.010 --> 05:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
Committee in those instances where you
 
05:57:29.628 --> 05:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
meant to say commission and its public
 
05:57:29.638 --> 05:57:33.770 align:start position:0%
meant to say commission and its public
members

05:57:33.770 --> 05:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:33.780 --> 05:57:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:57:34.910 --> 05:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:57:38.570 --> 05:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:38.580 --> 05:57:41.208 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:57:41.208 --> 05:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
one more question along those lines
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um are there any
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
I guess locations throughout where
 
05:57:52.610 --> 05:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
commission is used to mean specifically
 
05:57:55.788 --> 05:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
the puc and not also
 
05:57:57.708 --> 05:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
the members or
 
05:57:57.718 --> 05:58:01.010 align:start position:0%
the members or
um

05:58:01.010 --> 05:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:03.048 --> 05:58:03.058 align:start position:0%
probably it would mean going through the
 
05:58:05.570 --> 05:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
entire 15 pages and reading each
 
05:58:10.390 --> 05:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
or the word should be committee okay but
 
05:58:17.090 --> 05:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
so like in general 363 D3 powers and
 
05:58:19.490 --> 05:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
duties this really refers to the whole
 
05:58:21.530 --> 05:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
committee including the public members
 
05:58:21.540 --> 05:58:22.910 align:start position:0%
committee including the public members
not

05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
just the puc right
 
05:58:28.730 --> 05:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
or are the public members really only
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
meant to be making
 
05:58:33.650 --> 05:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
decisions you know making that very
 
05:58:35.628 --> 05:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
final decision but not really involved
 
05:58:38.270 --> 05:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the rest of the process
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:54.110 --> 05:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay good question
 
05:58:57.288 --> 05:58:57.298 align:start position:0%
another excuse me chair yes
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative closure
 
05:59:02.510 --> 05:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
not to be late lager this which I'm
 
05:59:05.208 --> 05:59:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.788 --> 05:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
um the page 14
 
05:59:10.750 --> 05:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh the line 12.
 
05:59:13.610 --> 05:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
when we have two subsets commissioned
 
05:59:15.288 --> 05:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
and public members
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
we put the public members in there so
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
they would have a say
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
in reality if they were against
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
something it's always three to two they
 
05:59:26.208 --> 05:59:26.218 align:start position:0%
always lose if they're
 
05:59:28.850 --> 05:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
if they vote against it's always it's
 
05:59:30.770 --> 05:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
just uh POC
 
05:59:33.070 --> 05:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
who carries
 
05:59:40.970 --> 05:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.980 --> 05:59:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
that assumes that all commission
 
05:59:47.930 --> 05:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
proceedings would be a matter of opinion
 
05:59:53.090 --> 05:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:53.100 --> 05:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:58.430 --> 05:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
all their all their decisions have to be
 
06:00:03.948 --> 06:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.190 --> 06:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
on the on the record
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
which is the Assembly of facts that have
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
been accumulated during the course of
 
06:00:14.448 --> 06:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
the proceeding
 
06:00:14.458 --> 06:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
the proceeding
so

06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
while it is I suppose possible for an
 
06:00:22.010 --> 06:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
accumulation of facts
 
06:00:22.020 --> 06:00:23.390 align:start position:0%
accumulation of facts
to

06:00:23.390 --> 06:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:26.930 --> 06:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
always be interpreted different ways
 
06:00:29.270 --> 06:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
by the same people
 
06:00:34.030 --> 06:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:38.570 --> 06:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you my apologies I was I was
 
06:00:40.490 --> 06:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
thinking my mind referring back to
 
06:00:42.650 --> 06:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
changing commissions and public members
 
06:00:44.270 --> 06:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned if you
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
call it a committee then they're all
 
06:00:50.330 --> 06:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
equal no matter how they vote but right
 
06:00:52.250 --> 06:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
now when you look at it it's two
 
06:00:55.128 --> 06:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
separate groups of uh
 
06:00:58.490 --> 06:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
bear with me committee thank you
 
06:00:58.500 --> 06:01:02.930 align:start position:0%
bear with me committee thank you
okay

06:01:02.930 --> 06:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:05.090 --> 06:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
parent representative Harrington has
 
06:01:07.010 --> 06:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
another question thank you uh just as a
 
06:01:08.810 --> 06:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
more generic one uh because it's not
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
really clear maybe it's in here and I
 
06:01:13.548 --> 06:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
just don't see it uh The puc Works under
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
a different set of rules than almost
 
06:01:16.610 --> 06:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
every other state agencies they're not
 
06:01:18.650 --> 06:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
subject to public hearings on their
 
06:01:20.690 --> 06:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
dissertations they're factor in closed
 
06:01:24.010 --> 06:01:24.020 align:start position:0%
rooms uh and that's been allowed by law
 
06:01:27.350 --> 06:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh when the puc were members of the site
 
06:01:29.690 --> 06:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee that didn't apply
 
06:01:31.128 --> 06:01:31.138 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee's
 
06:01:33.770 --> 06:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
dissertations were in public and were
 
06:01:36.288 --> 06:01:36.298 align:start position:0%
open to everybody so it's not clear by
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this which set of rules are
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to apply it's going to be the ones
 
06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
that in the previous site evaluation
 
06:01:43.128 --> 06:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
committee or the present ones for the
 
06:01:43.138 --> 06:01:45.470 align:start position:0%
committee or the present ones for the
puc

06:01:45.470 --> 06:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
puc
 
06:01:46.730 --> 06:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
I think it's something we need to
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
clarify in here
 
06:01:50.810 --> 06:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
so which uh Provisions are you talking
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
about I don't know exactly where you'd
 
06:01:54.410 --> 06:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
put it but that's just a general comment
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
and the the puc is exempt from the uh
 
06:02:00.350 --> 06:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
what do you want to call it being in
 
06:02:02.330 --> 06:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
public dissertation uh rule that every
 
06:02:04.850 --> 06:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
other agent most every other agency is
 
06:02:07.128 --> 06:02:07.138 align:start position:0%
uh not exempt from now so when the P
 
06:02:08.690 --> 06:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
when three Commissioners meet they meet
 
06:02:10.730 --> 06:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
in private behind closed doors come up
 
06:02:12.288 --> 06:02:12.298 align:start position:0%
with the decision document that and
 
06:02:14.510 --> 06:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
publish it when the site evaluation
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
committee meets whether it's three puc
 
06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners presently or two or one or
 
06:02:22.250 --> 06:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
whatever there is no such uh closed-door
 
06:02:24.110 --> 06:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
meetings all the hearings are in public
 
06:02:27.650 --> 06:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
and they they deliberate in public so
 
06:02:29.868 --> 06:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
which one is going to apply to this one
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
because it is something we have to
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
clarify since you're a former member of
 
06:02:38.810 --> 06:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
the SEC what does the SEC do to uh when
 
06:02:42.890 --> 06:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's asked by an applicant to protect
 
06:02:45.288 --> 06:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
certain information and keep it private
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
well proprietary reasons there are
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
certain things for proprietary reasons
 
06:02:51.288 --> 06:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
normally the the in the past this was
 
06:02:52.910 --> 06:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
another question that it was a lawyer
 
06:02:55.730 --> 06:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
outside lawyer assigned to the SEC that
 
06:02:57.048 --> 06:02:57.058 align:start position:0%
was most of the time it was always Mike
 
06:02:57.058 --> 06:02:58.730 align:start position:0%
was most of the time it was always Mike
icapino

06:02:58.730 --> 06:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
icapino
 
06:03:00.470 --> 06:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and that would be the person you'd
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
look to to see if there was something
 
06:03:03.948 --> 06:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
that was coming in that was considered
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know not not to be made public
 
06:03:09.410 --> 06:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
maybe some type of a projection of
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
capacity factors or something like that
 
06:03:13.850 --> 06:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
that the plant might have but other than
 
06:03:15.890 --> 06:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
something like that the dissertations
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
where the all the commission members sat
 
06:03:20.330 --> 06:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
down into and went over the whole thing
 
06:03:22.010 --> 06:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
and made the determination as to whether
 
06:03:24.110 --> 06:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
it'll grow not to Grant a permit or to
 
06:03:25.970 --> 06:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
Grant it and if they did with what type
 
06:03:28.250 --> 06:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
of conditions were going to be assigned
 
06:03:30.230 --> 06:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
to it that was all done in public
 
06:03:32.810 --> 06:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
and like I say normal puc dissertations
 
06:03:35.690 --> 06:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
are done in private
 
06:03:37.250 --> 06:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:03:39.708 --> 06:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
so the last part of the amendment that I
 
06:03:42.470 --> 06:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
want to bring your intervention to
 
06:03:44.570 --> 06:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you I'm
 
06:03:46.128 --> 06:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt
 
06:03:48.350 --> 06:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
um actually going along with what uh
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative pojo was asking
 
06:03:53.810 --> 06:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
I noticed that there's nothing in in the
 
06:03:56.208 --> 06:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
amendment about what constitutes a
 
06:03:58.250 --> 06:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
quorum of this
 
06:04:00.128 --> 06:04:00.138 align:start position:0%
committee or body
 
06:04:04.730 --> 06:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
and given that uh that the Lord Quorum
 
06:04:06.530 --> 06:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear in here
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
um give given that the typical
 
06:04:10.750 --> 06:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
definition of Quorum would be a majority
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
then would it be possible for this body
 
06:04:16.490 --> 06:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
to meet with just the puc Commissioners
 
06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
and not the members of the public and
 
06:04:21.410 --> 06:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
then vote on something in in that
 
06:04:21.420 --> 06:04:25.010 align:start position:0%
then vote on something in in that
configuration

06:04:25.010 --> 06:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:26.990 --> 06:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
as currently written I would say yes the
 
06:04:28.850 --> 06:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is yes
 
06:04:31.670 --> 06:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds thank you Mr
 
06:04:31.680 --> 06:04:32.690 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds thank you Mr
chairman

06:04:32.690 --> 06:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:04:36.110 --> 06:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
um while while I'm not an attorney
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
um as you we've already noted we have we
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
have several here in the room but I
 
06:04:43.250 --> 06:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
think that the and I think
 
06:04:45.948 --> 06:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for bringing
 
06:04:48.410 --> 06:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
up what he just brought up
 
06:04:48.420 --> 06:04:49.250 align:start position:0%
up what he just brought up
um

06:04:49.250 --> 06:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:49.260 --> 06:04:51.650 align:start position:0%
um
about

06:04:51.650 --> 06:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:04:54.948 --> 06:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that the SEC had rules that
 
06:04:57.288 --> 06:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
applied to it and I'd like to point out
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
remind I guess everybody that that
 
06:04:59.760 --> 06:05:01.730 align:start position:0%
remind I guess everybody that that
um

06:05:01.730 --> 06:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:04.368 --> 06:05:04.378 align:start position:0%
um Miss Hatfield in her testimony uh
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony to us made the very
 
06:05:08.930 --> 06:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
point in writing that that
 
06:05:10.670 --> 06:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington just explained
 
06:05:10.680 --> 06:05:12.770 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington just explained
that

06:05:12.770 --> 06:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:15.890 --> 06:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
you know about the requirement of the
 
06:05:18.590 --> 06:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
SEC to operate in public and decide in
 
06:05:22.010 --> 06:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
public so that says to me that we we
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
need to do more work to Define I think
 
06:05:26.930 --> 06:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
06:05:30.650 --> 06:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
that is separate from the commission
 
06:05:34.430 --> 06:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
because the commission may you know
 
06:05:35.868 --> 06:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
Opera deliberate in private and
 
06:05:38.208 --> 06:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
obviously that's counter two and I want
 
06:05:40.010 --> 06:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
to say I appreciate your
 
06:05:40.020 --> 06:05:40.788 align:start position:0%
to say I appreciate your
um

06:05:40.788 --> 06:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:43.010 --> 06:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
your efforts here in the amendment to
 
06:05:46.610 --> 06:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know have public members be
 
06:05:49.010 --> 06:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
part of the deciding body
 
06:05:50.930 --> 06:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
so I think we've got some more work on
 
06:05:52.850 --> 06:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
the amendment to do to
 
06:05:55.368 --> 06:05:55.378 align:start position:0%
bring back something called a committee
 
06:05:59.510 --> 06:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee perhaps
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so that both of these things are
 
06:06:03.410 --> 06:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
addressed in the Quorum issue and the
 
06:06:05.448 --> 06:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
voting issue and the and the operating
 
06:06:07.010 --> 06:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
in public
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for your comment
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the rest of the
 
06:06:13.970 --> 06:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
amendment that I want to draw your
 
06:06:17.930 --> 06:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
attention to on page 15.
 
06:06:20.510 --> 06:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's new text about
 
06:06:22.850 --> 06:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
the what happens during the transition
 
06:06:25.250 --> 06:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
period between
 
06:06:28.368 --> 06:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
any applications that are being in any
 
06:06:30.890 --> 06:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
proceedings that are happening based on
 
06:06:33.650 --> 06:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
RSA 162h
 
06:06:36.770 --> 06:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.230 --> 06:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the changeover to proceedings to
 
06:06:39.240 --> 06:06:40.610 align:start position:0%
and the changeover to proceedings to
under

06:06:40.610 --> 06:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:06:42.970 --> 06:06:42.980 align:start position:0%
363 d
 
06:06:46.990 --> 06:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
363 D so this transition language
 
06:06:50.510 --> 06:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
explains what exactly what happens there
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then starting on line 36
 
06:06:57.170 --> 06:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
there is text that specifies that the
 
06:06:59.750 --> 06:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
rules that are already in place that
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
were written under RSA 162 h
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
shall apply
 
06:07:10.610 --> 06:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.288 --> 06:07:14.298 align:start position:0%
going forward until such rules are
 
06:07:19.070 --> 06:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
expired or they are amended or replaced
 
06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
via a new rule-making process
 
06:07:25.128 --> 06:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
and that rule making process would be
 
06:07:27.288 --> 06:07:27.298 align:start position:0%
subject to the
 
06:07:30.530 --> 06:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
gel car process The Joint legislative
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules
 
06:07:36.470 --> 06:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
so that any new rules made would have to
 
06:07:40.430 --> 06:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
be approved by the the gel car which is
 
06:07:40.440 --> 06:07:41.570 align:start position:0%
be approved by the the gel car which is
a

06:07:41.570 --> 06:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:07:45.170 --> 06:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
an arm of the legislature
 
06:07:48.410 --> 06:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
so those are the major changes that uh
 
06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
that have been made
 
06:07:52.190 --> 06:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:07:54.430 --> 06:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do now is discuss
 
06:07:57.170 --> 06:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
whether we could go forward with this
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
amendment or not
 
06:08:02.208 --> 06:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
and I would like to start
 
06:08:05.570 --> 06:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
by reminding all members
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
that right now the state of New
 
06:08:08.638 --> 06:08:09.590 align:start position:0%
that right now the state of New
Hampshire

06:08:09.590 --> 06:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:08:16.368 --> 06:08:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
it is so difficult to get a project
 
06:08:21.048 --> 06:08:21.058 align:start position:0%
passed in New Hampshire that
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
many developers will never try
 
06:08:26.570 --> 06:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
as we heard in testimony several times
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.010 --> 06:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
major project developers just don't come
 
06:08:37.070 --> 06:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
here because they don't depend they
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the citing process
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
is predictable enough
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
for to Warrant spending a substantial
 
06:08:47.930 --> 06:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
amount of capital
 
06:08:51.650 --> 06:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
to try to cite an energy project in this
 
06:08:51.660 --> 06:08:54.470 align:start position:0%
to try to cite an energy project in this
state

06:08:54.470 --> 06:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
so I think the real question before us
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
here is
 
06:09:00.770 --> 06:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
do we
 
06:09:03.470 --> 06:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
allow that situation to continue for an
 
06:09:05.570 --> 06:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
indefinite period of time
 
06:09:08.330 --> 06:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
while we quibble over a few small
 
06:09:08.340 --> 06:09:10.190 align:start position:0%
while we quibble over a few small
details

06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
details
 
06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
or do we move this legislation forward
 
06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
where many of those details can be
 
06:09:15.600 --> 06:09:17.690 align:start position:0%
where many of those details can be
resolved

06:09:17.690 --> 06:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
06:09:19.970 --> 06:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
06:09:22.850 --> 06:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
and through the administrative rules
 
06:09:24.530 --> 06:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
development process
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
I think that's the essential question we
 
06:09:29.330 --> 06:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
Face here today is it time to move this
 
06:09:34.670 --> 06:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.680 --> 06:09:36.170 align:start position:0%
 
continued

06:09:36.170 --> 06:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
continued
 
06:09:39.288 --> 06:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
tweaking and tinkering with
 
06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:45.770 --> 06:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
and possibly
 
06:09:48.890 --> 06:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
delay Future Energy projects even more
 
06:09:52.430 --> 06:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
than they might already be delayed
 
06:09:55.610 --> 06:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
we know we have offshore wind that wants
 
06:09:58.128 --> 06:09:58.138 align:start position:0%
to be developed
 
06:10:00.650 --> 06:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
off our Coastline we know there's going
 
06:10:01.970 --> 06:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
to be citing
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
projects involved with that offshore
 
06:10:04.558 --> 06:10:06.048 align:start position:0%
projects involved with that offshore
wind

06:10:06.048 --> 06:10:06.058 align:start position:0%
wind
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
06:10:12.110 --> 06:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
the coal plant in Beau is being eyed as
 
06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
a site to
 
06:10:14.160 --> 06:10:15.770 align:start position:0%
a site to
create

06:10:15.770 --> 06:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
create
 
06:10:19.670 --> 06:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and then use that hydrogen you
 
06:10:22.610 --> 06:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
create hydrogen using solar panels and
 
06:10:25.368 --> 06:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
then use that hydrogen to generate
 
06:10:25.378 --> 06:10:28.490 align:start position:0%
then use that hydrogen to generate
electricity

06:10:28.490 --> 06:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:31.490 --> 06:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
do we want to delay that project from
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
happening by dragging our feet on making
 
06:10:37.970 --> 06:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
a change to the site evaluation process
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
I think those are the questions we need
 
06:10:40.970 --> 06:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
to wrestle with
 
06:10:43.610 --> 06:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to get everybody's
 
06:10:45.530 --> 06:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
perspective on that idea representative
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas has a perspective
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first I would like to
 
06:10:51.600 --> 06:10:52.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first I would like to
remind

06:10:52.810 --> 06:10:52.820 align:start position:0%
remind
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
the audience that
 
06:10:57.890 --> 06:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
Center Waters is very much in favor of
 
06:11:01.930 --> 06:11:01.940 align:start position:0%
this bill and would like it to see pass
 
06:11:05.150 --> 06:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
but hearing from what for judging from
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
what I've been I've been hearing here I
 
06:11:10.628 --> 06:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
have a question for the chair if
 
06:11:14.350 --> 06:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
these comments that were made today
 
06:11:19.368 --> 06:11:19.378 align:start position:0%
were is it possible to put them into one
 
06:11:21.170 --> 06:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
more last Amendment
 
06:11:24.128 --> 06:11:24.138 align:start position:0%
realizing that we have a deadline of
 
06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
Wednesday noon time
 
06:11:29.448 --> 06:11:29.458 align:start position:0%
is it possible to
 
06:11:32.570 --> 06:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
recess this exec meeting to Wednesday
 
06:11:35.830 --> 06:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
morning with a new Amendment from OLS
 
06:11:38.690 --> 06:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
and and with the understanding that if
 
06:11:40.430 --> 06:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
we get everything that was put in here
 
06:11:43.910 --> 06:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
today that we can all agree that we
 
06:11:47.150 --> 06:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
could pass that amendment is that a is
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
that a possibility
 
06:11:51.410 --> 06:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
yes that is a real possibility
 
06:11:53.150 --> 06:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
of course all members of the committee
 
06:11:54.650 --> 06:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
would have to agree to that they'd have
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
to agree to come back here on Wednesday
 
06:11:59.868 --> 06:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
and then we would have to put our heads
 
06:12:02.208 --> 06:12:02.218 align:start position:0%
together collectively to hammer out
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
exactly what words we're going to change
 
06:12:05.868 --> 06:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
and how we're going to change them
 
06:12:08.690 --> 06:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then go off to OLS to request a new
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it is possible and it is
 
06:12:11.760 --> 06:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it is possible and it is
doable

06:12:12.830 --> 06:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
doable
 
06:12:14.810 --> 06:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:12:18.288 --> 06:12:18.298 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair one of my
 
06:12:20.810 --> 06:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
big concerns with this bill is that it
 
06:12:24.890 --> 06:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
was originally filed on 110 23 no it was
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually originally filed September 10th
 
06:12:32.030 --> 06:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
23 the um and on January 10 23 the
 
06:12:34.850 --> 06:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was entered as no physical
 
06:12:34.860 --> 06:12:35.868 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was entered as no physical
note

06:12:35.868 --> 06:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
note
 
06:12:38.810 --> 06:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
the first amendment was filed on March 6
 
06:12:42.470 --> 06:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
2023 it contains no fiscal note this
 
06:12:45.410 --> 06:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
current amendment is filed on March 13th
 
06:12:48.410 --> 06:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
2023 it contains no fiscal note this
 
06:12:50.030 --> 06:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
morning when I ask you about fiscal
 
06:12:51.890 --> 06:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
notes you said to check with the clerk's
 
06:12:54.110 --> 06:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
office I've heard back from the clerk's
 
06:12:56.628 --> 06:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
office and no fiscal note has been filed
 
06:12:59.628 --> 06:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
for this bill so you are asking us to
 
06:13:02.390 --> 06:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
support a bill and we're flying blind as
 
06:13:05.208 --> 06:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
far as finances are concerned
 
06:13:06.708 --> 06:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment do you
 
06:13:09.708 --> 06:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
remember uh in the introduced version of
 
06:13:10.970 --> 06:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
the bill because I don't have it right
 
06:13:15.650 --> 06:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
in front of me what the uh language at
 
06:13:17.570 --> 06:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
the end of The Bill said about a fiscal
 
06:13:19.610 --> 06:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
note it's a department of energy and
 
06:13:21.410 --> 06:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
Justice and judicial branch have been
 
06:13:21.420 --> 06:13:22.910 align:start position:0%
Justice and judicial branch have been
contacted

06:13:22.910 --> 06:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
contacted
 
06:13:24.830 --> 06:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
is that what you're talking about yes
 
06:13:27.530 --> 06:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
would you like to see oh I no I don't
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
need to see it I just wanted to know
 
06:13:31.430 --> 06:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
what departments were responsible for
 
06:13:33.048 --> 06:13:33.058 align:start position:0%
right so we have not heard from the
 
06:13:35.030 --> 06:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and Justice energy
 
06:13:37.368 --> 06:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
and Justice or energy Justice and
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
06:13:40.850 --> 06:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
well fortunately we have the department
 
06:13:43.010 --> 06:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
of energy here with us today
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps they'd like to tell us what the
 
06:13:47.868 --> 06:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
status of any fiscal note for this bill
 
06:13:54.250 --> 06:13:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.628 --> 06:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:13:57.830 --> 06:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record Chris
 
06:13:59.150 --> 06:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
sounds Deputy Commissioner of the New
 
06:14:01.128 --> 06:14:01.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy
 
06:14:01.138 --> 06:14:02.448 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy
um

06:14:02.448 --> 06:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
given the uh fluid nature of the
 
06:14:07.730 --> 06:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
Amendments and the conversations related
 
06:14:10.250 --> 06:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
to this bill we just saw the copy of
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill today it would be
 
06:14:15.410 --> 06:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to make that estimation
 
06:14:18.410 --> 06:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
sitting here in the room although I am
 
06:14:20.690 --> 06:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
certain we could provide you with that
 
06:14:20.700 --> 06:14:22.250 align:start position:0%
certain we could provide you with that
information

06:14:22.250 --> 06:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:14:24.170 --> 06:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
you know by tomorrow morning if that was
 
06:14:27.048 --> 06:14:27.058 align:start position:0%
something that was was needed
 
06:14:31.490 --> 06:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.670 --> 06:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
would that satisfy you representative
 
06:14:36.948 --> 06:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
um I can't vote on any kind of a bill
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
unless I see the financial impact so yes
 
06:14:41.390 --> 06:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
it would if that that would be helpful
 
06:14:43.490 --> 06:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and what about the judicial
 
06:14:47.270 --> 06:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
branch are you going to contact them
 
06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
who I actually I'm asking the chair I
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
thought that was his responsibility but
 
06:14:52.610 --> 06:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
if you want to take that question go
 
06:14:52.620 --> 06:14:53.288 align:start position:0%
if you want to take that question go
ahead

06:14:53.288 --> 06:14:53.298 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
06:14:56.690 --> 06:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
no I would I would just say uh you know
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know the extent to which they're
 
06:15:01.368 --> 06:15:01.378 align:start position:0%
they they as an agency would need to
 
06:15:02.330 --> 06:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
weigh in
 
06:15:02.340 --> 06:15:06.048 align:start position:0%
weigh in
um

06:15:06.048 --> 06:15:06.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:07.970 --> 06:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
I think the Attorney General would have
 
06:15:09.948 --> 06:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on this would he not or
 
06:15:11.570 --> 06:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
would I was just referring to the
 
06:15:14.090 --> 06:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
judicial branch there okay
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
I believe the legislative budget office
 
06:15:19.690 --> 06:15:19.700 align:start position:0%
is the entity that
 
06:15:22.610 --> 06:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
contacts other departments to get
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
information about a fiscal note
 
06:15:27.530 --> 06:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
so maybe the legislative budget office
 
06:15:29.510 --> 06:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
is the one who thought that the
 
06:15:31.070 --> 06:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice might need to be
 
06:15:34.730 --> 06:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
if the truck's Department of Justice
 
06:15:38.030 --> 06:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's the Attorney General's office but
 
06:15:40.490 --> 06:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch has was contacted
 
06:15:40.500 --> 06:15:41.570 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch has was contacted
and

06:15:41.570 --> 06:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:43.490 --> 06:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
they would probably say indeterminable
 
06:15:45.288 --> 06:15:45.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure
 
06:15:45.298 --> 06:15:46.128 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure
uh

06:15:46.128 --> 06:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:15:48.230 --> 06:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
how much impact it has on the judicial
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:53.150 --> 06:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Oregon remember
 
06:15:55.910 --> 06:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
you have to be recognized to speak
 
06:15:58.850 --> 06:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh represent Mr shulock so if I may the
 
06:16:02.510 --> 06:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty in preparing a fiscal note is
 
06:16:06.910 --> 06:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
in part because the workload of the SEC
 
06:16:10.850 --> 06:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
is entirely unpredictable right and so
 
06:16:13.128 --> 06:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
when you look at the fee structure that
 
06:16:14.448 --> 06:16:14.458 align:start position:0%
you have here
 
06:16:15.830 --> 06:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know what you're going to charge
 
06:16:17.090 --> 06:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
people but you don't know how many
 
06:16:18.708 --> 06:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
people are going to show up
 
06:16:22.010 --> 06:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
right meanwhile one of the goals of of
 
06:16:25.368 --> 06:16:25.378 align:start position:0%
the study committees and I think of this
 
06:16:28.490 --> 06:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
bill is to make sure that the SEC is not
 
06:16:32.230 --> 06:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
just a pop-up agency that materializes
 
06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
only when there's something to decide
 
06:16:36.890 --> 06:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
and then goes away it's to give it
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
stability and to make sure that there
 
06:16:41.530 --> 06:16:41.540 align:start position:0%
are professional staff
 
06:16:44.110 --> 06:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
at all times
 
06:16:46.788 --> 06:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
who can constantly educate themselves
 
06:16:49.430 --> 06:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
and and come up to speed so that when a
 
06:16:51.650 --> 06:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
project does appear they're ready to go
 
06:16:56.270 --> 06:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
no so I think when you look at the way
 
06:16:58.128 --> 06:16:58.138 align:start position:0%
that this bill is set up
 
06:17:00.288 --> 06:17:00.298 align:start position:0%
the way that it's set up is to have
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
those stable positions hired and paid
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
for out of the utility assessment
 
06:17:11.090 --> 06:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
right and we have those employees or we
 
06:17:13.310 --> 06:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
we at least have the positions for the
 
06:17:15.770 --> 06:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
employees necessary to do that right
 
06:17:19.730 --> 06:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
plus there is the the current uh
 
06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
administrator who nobody intends to get
 
06:17:23.868 --> 06:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
rid of he would just go to the puc and
 
06:17:27.170 --> 06:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
be a POC employee doing that work right
 
06:17:31.548 --> 06:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
so you know we can look at the
 
06:17:35.330 --> 06:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
the the grade levels and the salaries of
 
06:17:37.610 --> 06:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
the people who will be working on it but
 
06:17:40.250 --> 06:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
what we're not going to know uh going
 
06:17:42.530 --> 06:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
forward is how much of their time
 
06:17:44.448 --> 06:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
exactly they're going to be spending on
 
06:17:46.490 --> 06:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
SEC work and how much of their time
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
exactly they're going to be spending
 
06:17:49.970 --> 06:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
doing utility assessment work the
 
06:17:52.368 --> 06:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
regular regulation regulation of Public
 
06:17:52.378 --> 06:17:53.570 align:start position:0%
regular regulation regulation of Public
Utilities

06:17:53.570 --> 06:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
Utilities
 
06:17:56.390 --> 06:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
right so anything we do is going to be a
 
06:18:00.410 --> 06:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
guess based upon probably uh
 
06:18:04.010 --> 06:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
five positions I I understand that and
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation however
 
06:18:08.990 --> 06:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that kind of your um your
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make your best guess I
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
mean we've had this bill since
 
06:18:15.230 --> 06:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
um last year November uh September of
 
06:18:16.368 --> 06:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:18:20.030 --> 06:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and we again we're Flying Blind we have
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
no idea we have no best guess we have no
 
06:18:23.930 --> 06:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
guests we have nothing so the the
 
06:18:27.110 --> 06:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
original Bill did not provide any
 
06:18:30.110 --> 06:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
support at all for for the SEC it didn't
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
mention who the employees would be or
 
06:18:35.570 --> 06:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
how they would be paid we're we are
 
06:18:37.730 --> 06:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
actually doing our very best to make it
 
06:18:40.128 --> 06:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
fluid and to make sure that there is
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
funding available and people available
 
06:18:45.650 --> 06:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
to do this but it's it's just a rolling
 
06:18:48.548 --> 06:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
Target at this point
 
06:18:51.890 --> 06:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that information
 
06:18:54.110 --> 06:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lucius partial is
 
06:18:54.120 --> 06:19:03.010 align:start position:0%
representative Lucius partial is
recognized

06:19:03.010 --> 06:19:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.690 --> 06:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly is recognized sorry
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just had a question about
 
06:19:08.510 --> 06:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
what you mentioned on part 15. I didn't
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
know the the RSA 162h carryover
 
06:19:14.750 --> 06:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
um wording I didn't know if that was
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
meant to bring over the five public
 
06:19:19.010 --> 06:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
members who are currently serving on the
 
06:19:20.750 --> 06:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee or if they
 
06:19:22.490 --> 06:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
would be wiped clean and have to
 
06:19:22.500 --> 06:19:23.570 align:start position:0%
would be wiped clean and have to
reappoint

06:19:23.570 --> 06:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
reappoint
 
06:19:25.730 --> 06:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
because of the language in the other
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
section says that they have to be
 
06:19:30.110 --> 06:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
appointed in staggered terms for their
 
06:19:32.750 --> 06:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
initial term and I wasn't sure if that
 
06:19:34.850 --> 06:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
would you know and then they have to do
 
06:19:36.410 --> 06:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
training so I wasn't sure if that would
 
06:19:38.750 --> 06:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
preclude the public members from serving
 
06:19:41.270 --> 06:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
on the initial meetings if the if
 
06:19:42.410 --> 06:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're taking over the responsibility
 
06:19:44.090 --> 06:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
site evaluation can you committee
 
06:19:45.590 --> 06:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
immediately I just didn't know if that
 
06:19:47.750 --> 06:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
language meant that or if I'm
 
06:19:53.150 --> 06:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:55.070 --> 06:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
not sure I fully understand your
 
06:19:55.080 --> 06:19:56.030 align:start position:0%
not sure I fully understand your
question

06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:19:59.090 --> 06:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
are you asking if
 
06:20:02.390 --> 06:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
the pool of five public members which
 
06:20:04.250 --> 06:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
presumably would be
 
06:20:04.260 --> 06:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
presumably would be
appointed

06:20:06.470 --> 06:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
06:20:09.590 --> 06:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
after this legislation takes effect
 
06:20:10.970 --> 06:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
after it's
 
06:20:13.730 --> 06:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
effective date are you asking if they
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
would be appointed quickly enough to
 
06:20:20.448 --> 06:20:20.458 align:start position:0%
make it onto any application proceeding
 
06:20:23.448 --> 06:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
that's that might come down the pike
 
06:20:25.250 --> 06:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes partial so it's I guess it's two
 
06:20:26.750 --> 06:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
parts so it's a first part we have five
 
06:20:28.250 --> 06:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
public members of the site evaluation
 
06:20:30.110 --> 06:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee currently who are selecting a
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
similar two-person process to to vote
 
06:20:34.610 --> 06:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
with those five members immediately
 
06:20:36.410 --> 06:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
become the five members on this new
 
06:20:38.448 --> 06:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
commission and I understand because of
 
06:20:40.730 --> 06:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
the 162h carryover language or is it
 
06:20:42.530 --> 06:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
they have to be pointed and we have to
 
06:20:45.288 --> 06:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
appoint starting with two initially
 
06:20:48.470 --> 06:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
well this uh language doesn't say one
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
way or the other whether they would they
 
06:20:54.410 --> 06:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
would come over from the 165 162h
 
06:20:57.410 --> 06:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
process but it would be a logical place
 
06:21:00.170 --> 06:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
to start to uh
 
06:21:02.750 --> 06:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
make those five members then the five
 
06:21:09.250 --> 06:21:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:11.270 --> 06:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
06:21:14.270 --> 06:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um a couple of comments actually
 
06:21:16.010 --> 06:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
um first something was just mentioned
 
06:21:17.330 --> 06:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised some of the people in the
 
06:21:18.708 --> 06:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
back in the room didn't jump up and down
 
06:21:20.510 --> 06:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
when they heard this but what was just
 
06:21:22.610 --> 06:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
stated is that the employees that are
 
06:21:25.010 --> 06:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
going to be working on the for the
 
06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
Department of energy doing site
 
06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee work are going to
 
06:21:30.708 --> 06:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
be funded out of the assessment or maybe
 
06:21:32.390 --> 06:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
not Department of energy the puc are
 
06:21:33.650 --> 06:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
going to be the assessment on utilities
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
and I don't think because a lot of these
 
06:21:37.310 --> 06:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
projects have nothing to do with
 
06:21:39.530 --> 06:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
utilities I mean like for example
 
06:21:42.650 --> 06:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
propane storage in Newington we
 
06:21:44.628 --> 06:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have the rate payers be paying
 
06:21:46.250 --> 06:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
for anybody doing that maybe I
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood that part the second thing
 
06:21:50.590 --> 06:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring up again is I'm just
 
06:21:53.570 --> 06:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear we need public members on
 
06:21:56.510 --> 06:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
this we don't do it for anything else
 
06:21:58.190 --> 06:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
somebody I used the example I gave
 
06:22:00.770 --> 06:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
before the Tuscan Village down in Salem
 
06:22:03.110 --> 06:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's like thousands of acres and all
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of apartments and COA and uh
 
06:22:07.788 --> 06:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know this is restaurants
 
06:22:09.350 --> 06:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
theaters movie theaters the shopping
 
06:22:11.270 --> 06:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
centers everything you can think of and
 
06:22:12.890 --> 06:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
yet there's a whole mess of boards and
 
06:22:14.570 --> 06:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
agencies will be involved in permitting
 
06:22:16.490 --> 06:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
that none of which have public members
 
06:22:18.110 --> 06:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
on them they have elected or appointed
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
members and since we're going to have a
 
06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
public Council here
 
06:22:24.110 --> 06:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
um or which seems like it's in the
 
06:22:25.548 --> 06:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
statute I don't see why we have to have
 
06:22:27.410 --> 06:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
public members I think it just kind of
 
06:22:29.090 --> 06:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
bogs it down we don't do it for anything
 
06:22:31.310 --> 06:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
else that I'm aware of will we appoint
 
06:22:33.470 --> 06:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
public members that are voting members
 
06:22:36.048 --> 06:22:36.058 align:start position:0%
and issue certificates that come out of
 
06:22:37.610 --> 06:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
06:22:37.620 --> 06:22:39.708 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
so

06:22:39.708 --> 06:22:39.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:41.690 --> 06:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
utility assessment one I think David's
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to address it sounds like
 
06:22:47.030 --> 06:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
so I want to read you what it says in
 
06:22:50.448 --> 06:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
section D4 on page three
 
06:22:52.490 --> 06:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
says the commission shall assign one of
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
its own employees the responsibilities
 
06:22:57.230 --> 06:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
of site evaluation administrator in
 
06:22:59.750 --> 06:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
addition to that employee's regulatory
 
06:22:59.760 --> 06:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
addition to that employee's regulatory
responsibilities

06:23:01.490 --> 06:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
06:23:03.350 --> 06:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
the commission and the department May
 
06:23:05.090 --> 06:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
assign work to one or more of their
 
06:23:07.010 --> 06:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
employees to fulfill the requirements of
 
06:23:08.330 --> 06:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
06:23:11.208 --> 06:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
the cost of which shall be charged to
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
the energy facility citing fund so I
 
06:23:17.628 --> 06:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
think what Mr shulock was saying is that
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
there will be Department employees in
 
06:23:22.670 --> 06:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
the department of energy who when they
 
06:23:25.250 --> 06:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
are not working on energy sighting
 
06:23:25.260 --> 06:23:26.570 align:start position:0%
are not working on energy sighting
projects

06:23:26.570 --> 06:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
projects
 
06:23:29.448 --> 06:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
we'll get there
 
06:23:34.128 --> 06:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
their paycheck from utility assessments
 
06:23:37.850 --> 06:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
funds that the the department gets for a
 
06:23:40.788 --> 06:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
utility assessment work is that correct
 
06:23:42.590 --> 06:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
so the way that it would be set up is
 
06:23:45.410 --> 06:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
that all of these employees their basic
 
06:23:47.150 --> 06:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
employment would be as Department
 
06:23:49.510 --> 06:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
employees or puc employees
 
06:23:49.520 --> 06:23:51.190 align:start position:0%
employees or puc employees
and

06:23:51.190 --> 06:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:55.310 --> 06:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
we had to make sure I mean when
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
that there would be sufficient
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory work for them to do to
 
06:24:02.990 --> 06:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
justify the positions right that's part
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the reason why it would take so long
 
06:24:06.490 --> 06:24:06.500 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:24:10.190 --> 06:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note because we have to to
 
06:24:13.128 --> 06:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
assure that these employees will be
 
06:24:15.890 --> 06:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
doing legitimate work right regulatory
 
06:24:17.868 --> 06:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
work under that regulatory assessment
 
06:24:20.868 --> 06:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
right whenever and then whenever they do
 
06:24:23.390 --> 06:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
citing work they would simply build that
 
06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
work their time all their overhead to
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
the SEC fund right and it would be paid
 
06:24:31.190 --> 06:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
out of that fund it's an accounting
 
06:24:34.850 --> 06:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
measure to make sure that would be doing
 
06:24:38.030 --> 06:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
time sheets essentially to make sure
 
06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
that the proper funds are used for the
 
06:24:42.730 --> 06:24:42.740 align:start position:0%
work that's done
 
06:24:44.570 --> 06:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington does that
 
06:24:45.948 --> 06:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
06:24:47.810 --> 06:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
well to some extent but it brings up
 
06:24:49.250 --> 06:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
another one it sounds like we have
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
employees that are going to be there
 
06:24:53.570 --> 06:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
doing something that they really don't
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
have to do because when a site
 
06:24:57.530 --> 06:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
evaluation application is received
 
06:24:59.330 --> 06:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
they'll stop doing whatever it is they
 
06:25:01.490 --> 06:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
were doing and work on that for the next
 
06:25:04.368 --> 06:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
six months or something so why do we
 
06:25:05.868 --> 06:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
need them then when they're going to go
 
06:25:07.970 --> 06:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
back and if no site evaluation work
 
06:25:09.650 --> 06:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
comes then these people are going to be
 
06:25:11.090 --> 06:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
doing work that's not really necessary
 
06:25:12.890 --> 06:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
because if we can pull them off it for
 
06:25:15.288 --> 06:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
six months I mean is it really uh
 
06:25:17.090 --> 06:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
necessary I just that seems like a
 
06:25:19.190 --> 06:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
strange way to go about looking at I
 
06:25:20.150 --> 06:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a better way but
 
06:25:22.850 --> 06:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
it just strikes me as uh that if they're
 
06:25:25.430 --> 06:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing a regulatory function and
 
06:25:26.750 --> 06:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
then we're going to say okay stop doing
 
06:25:28.610 --> 06:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
your regular job for the next six months
 
06:25:31.610 --> 06:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
go do this makes me wonder about how
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
important their first regular job was if
 
06:25:35.810 --> 06:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
they can put it just turn it off for six
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:42.350 --> 06:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of the work to go around
 
06:25:44.270 --> 06:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot that we can do I think one
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the complaints that we've we've heard
 
06:25:49.610 --> 06:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
certainly in the in the audience is that
 
06:25:50.990 --> 06:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
people don't think that the Public
 
06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is getting to its
 
06:25:54.288 --> 06:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
work quickly enough
 
06:25:56.090 --> 06:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's resolved by having additional
 
06:25:58.910 --> 06:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
employees to help do that work same at
 
06:26:00.530 --> 06:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:26:00.540 --> 06:26:02.770 align:start position:0%
the department
um

06:26:02.770 --> 06:26:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:05.868 --> 06:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
at least one of these employees will be
 
06:26:08.750 --> 06:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
assigned in our Safety Division which
 
06:26:10.730 --> 06:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
has to increase its number of
 
06:26:13.010 --> 06:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
inspections over the course of the Year
 
06:26:15.170 --> 06:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
our federal funding depends upon that
 
06:26:16.970 --> 06:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
and so we've looked at all those issues
 
06:26:19.368 --> 06:26:19.378 align:start position:0%
to to try and make sure that these
 
06:26:21.048 --> 06:26:21.058 align:start position:0%
people will be gainfully employed I mean
 
06:26:24.730 --> 06:26:24.740 align:start position:0%
legitimately employed doing utility work
 
06:26:28.868 --> 06:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
and would just bill time to to the SEC
 
06:26:31.750 --> 06:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
when necessary and and
 
06:26:34.128 --> 06:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
we'll just move people around and make
 
06:26:35.930 --> 06:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
sure the work gets done
 
06:26:37.310 --> 06:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:26:39.948 --> 06:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh do you have any estimate
 
06:26:41.690 --> 06:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
you have a working estimate of something
 
06:26:43.548 --> 06:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
you want to look forward and say we we
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
expect we're going to plan on in 2025 we
 
06:26:49.010 --> 06:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
will have two applications for the SEC
 
06:26:51.948 --> 06:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
or three or none or I mean how do you
 
06:26:55.070 --> 06:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
so the the number of applications is a
 
06:27:00.770 --> 06:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
real uh
 
06:27:02.448 --> 06:27:02.458 align:start position:0%
we don't know what they're going to be
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
06:27:11.208 --> 06:27:11.218 align:start position:0%
for a comment uh thank you chair Bose
 
06:27:13.070 --> 06:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a question
 
06:27:15.048 --> 06:27:15.058 align:start position:0%
um you had originally said your deadline
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
is end of day Wednesday if we were to
 
06:27:19.010 --> 06:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
spend some more time working on and
 
06:27:21.048 --> 06:27:21.058 align:start position:0%
refining and making this something that
 
06:27:23.330 --> 06:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
we could realistically vote on I think
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
it might be noon on Wednesday noon on
 
06:27:27.410 --> 06:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is the deadline okay so I
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
understand we're going to have a
 
06:27:30.470 --> 06:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
snowstorm tomorrow
 
06:27:34.910 --> 06:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh this this committee has put
 
06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
some significant effort into last minute
 
06:27:39.230 --> 06:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
review but I think it needs a little bit
 
06:27:40.910 --> 06:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
more last minute review I don't think
 
06:27:43.850 --> 06:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
today's quick reading and quick
 
06:27:46.250 --> 06:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
discussion is enough I think oftentimes
 
06:27:47.750 --> 06:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
it takes a little bit of the marinating
 
06:27:49.970 --> 06:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
process to really come up with aha
 
06:27:52.788 --> 06:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
moments and so I
 
06:27:54.288 --> 06:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak for the other
 
06:27:56.090 --> 06:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
members of my caucus but I would say
 
06:27:58.250 --> 06:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
that I think it's it is realistic to
 
06:28:00.470 --> 06:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
have another conversation as a committee
 
06:28:03.288 --> 06:28:03.298 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a break for OLS to make some
 
06:28:05.628 --> 06:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
revisions and then a vote I don't think
 
06:28:07.548 --> 06:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
that that is realistic today but it
 
06:28:08.810 --> 06:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
looks like it would have to be Wednesday
 
06:28:10.730 --> 06:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
morning if we were serious about coming
 
06:28:12.170 --> 06:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
up with something so I just want to put
 
06:28:13.788 --> 06:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
that out there
 
06:28:15.650 --> 06:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
you are correct
 
06:28:18.890 --> 06:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
the forecast though um representative
 
06:28:21.170 --> 06:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a comment thank you the
 
06:28:25.010 --> 06:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
forecast goes into Wednesday for uh
 
06:28:29.150 --> 06:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:31.250 --> 06:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay further comments representative
 
06:28:31.260 --> 06:28:32.448 align:start position:0%
okay further comments representative
Grecian

06:28:32.448 --> 06:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
Grecian
 
06:28:33.890 --> 06:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
06:28:35.810 --> 06:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I agree with my colleague from
 
06:28:38.090 --> 06:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
Concord and also just want to highlight
 
06:28:40.610 --> 06:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
that given that this is clearly a very
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
sensitive issue for the public I think
 
06:28:45.288 --> 06:28:45.298 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we make a
 
06:28:47.208 --> 06:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to get a full public
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on as close to the final version
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
of of the bill as possible as we pass
 
06:28:53.990 --> 06:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
out just so that
 
06:28:56.150 --> 06:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
um the public has faith in the process
 
06:28:58.610 --> 06:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't feel that they're being
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
unfairly railroaded as we heard that
 
06:29:03.890 --> 06:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
sentiment expressed quite a bit today
 
06:29:03.900 --> 06:29:05.030 align:start position:0%
sentiment expressed quite a bit today
okay

06:29:05.030 --> 06:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:29:07.010 --> 06:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
let's see a show of hands of people who
 
06:29:09.590 --> 06:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
would like to work on this
 
06:29:09.600 --> 06:29:11.090 align:start position:0%
would like to work on this
Amendment

06:29:11.090 --> 06:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:29:12.770 --> 06:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
and try to get it
 
06:29:15.048 --> 06:29:15.058 align:start position:0%
get something ready
 
06:29:17.628 --> 06:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
for late Wednesday morning that we could
 
06:29:30.288 --> 06:29:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:31.910 --> 06:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay 11.
 
06:29:34.548 --> 06:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
so how many people I guess that means
 
06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
nine people would not be interested in
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:44.930 --> 06:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:44.940 --> 06:29:46.368 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:29:46.368 --> 06:29:46.378 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:29:49.150 --> 06:29:49.160 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:29:51.470 --> 06:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams and I will try
 
06:29:53.448 --> 06:29:53.458 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way to
 
06:29:55.788 --> 06:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
make some additional changes to this
 
06:29:57.948 --> 06:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
amendment and bring something forward on
 
06:29:57.958 --> 06:29:59.030 align:start position:0%
amendment and bring something forward on
Wednesday

06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
06:30:01.128 --> 06:30:01.138 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas will work
 
06:30:03.410 --> 06:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
with our committee administrator to try
 
06:30:05.090 --> 06:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
to come up with a room we could meet in
 
06:30:06.590 --> 06:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
because apparently this room is not
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
available on Wednesday
 
06:30:10.010 --> 06:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee I think will be
 
06:30:10.970 --> 06:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
in here
 
06:30:13.548 --> 06:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
and but hopefully we can find a room
 
06:30:15.530 --> 06:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
because I don't think fish and game is
 
06:30:18.410 --> 06:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
meeting anymore correct
 
06:30:20.510 --> 06:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
06:30:25.070 --> 06:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
so representative Bernardi has a comment
 
06:30:27.948 --> 06:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
because tomorrow is being canceled it's
 
06:30:30.288 --> 06:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
my understanding all the Committees that
 
06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
are meeting tomorrow will be looking for
 
06:30:36.650 --> 06:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
space on Wednesday as well it's going to
 
06:30:42.410 --> 06:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:42.420 --> 06:30:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:30:43.730 --> 06:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:30:46.490 --> 06:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
well I guess representative Doug Thomas
 
06:30:53.628 --> 06:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:55.490 --> 06:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
we are not going to vote on this bill
 
06:30:57.590 --> 06:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
today we are going to
 
06:30:57.600 --> 06:30:59.448 align:start position:0%
today we are going to
um

06:30:59.448 --> 06:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:02.930 --> 06:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
take a extended break from our committee
 
06:31:06.110 --> 06:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
work today and try to reassemble on
 
06:31:08.930 --> 06:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning at 9 00 A.M
 
06:31:11.930 --> 06:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
God willing weather permitting
 
06:31:13.930 --> 06:31:13.940 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
see if we can come up with something
 
06:31:18.590 --> 06:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we can all Mr move forward to the
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Mr representative Corman thank
 
06:31:21.000 --> 06:31:21.770 align:start position:0%
Senate Mr representative Corman thank
you

06:31:21.770 --> 06:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
um before we break I just want to return
 
06:31:25.310 --> 06:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
to the question or the point I brought
 
06:31:26.570 --> 06:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
up before about
 
06:31:29.150 --> 06:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
um the the vote in its final form being
 
06:31:32.868 --> 06:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
made by the three puc Commissioners and
 
06:31:35.208 --> 06:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
the public members whether we call that
 
06:31:38.750 --> 06:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
a committee or the the commission and
 
06:31:41.110 --> 06:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
public members combined
 
06:31:44.390 --> 06:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we add text saying
 
06:31:46.910 --> 06:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
that all five members must be present
 
06:31:53.690 --> 06:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:59.930 --> 06:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:03.850 --> 06:32:03.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:06.170 --> 06:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a comment
 
06:32:08.090 --> 06:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
on that comment I say this from
 
06:32:09.830 --> 06:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
experience having served on eight or
 
06:32:12.170 --> 06:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
nine site evaluation committees that's
 
06:32:14.270 --> 06:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
doomed to failure because trying to get
 
06:32:17.030 --> 06:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
five people all scheduled the same time
 
06:32:18.350 --> 06:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
when you're doing this we literally
 
06:32:20.390 --> 06:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
would sit around in a room for 15 to 20
 
06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
minutes with little phones going back
 
06:32:23.750 --> 06:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and forth just trying to get time when
 
06:32:26.208 --> 06:32:26.218 align:start position:0%
everybody could show up so requiring
 
06:32:28.610 --> 06:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
five members to be there at all times I
 
06:32:30.350 --> 06:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
think would make sure you didn't have a
 
06:32:32.810 --> 06:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
lot of meetings because remember the puc
 
06:32:35.208 --> 06:32:35.218 align:start position:0%
still has other work to do I know the
 
06:32:35.218 --> 06:32:36.070 align:start position:0%
still has other work to do I know the
two

06:32:36.070 --> 06:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:32:39.288 --> 06:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
public members may not but they may also
 
06:32:41.628 --> 06:32:41.638 align:start position:0%
be they may have another job that they
 
06:32:43.788 --> 06:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
go to or or whatever so I just think
 
06:32:45.170 --> 06:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
five is going to be really difficult to
 
06:32:48.288 --> 06:32:48.298 align:start position:0%
get right so um if I may respond yes you
 
06:32:49.910 --> 06:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
may respond so point taken
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I'm suggesting
 
06:32:53.208 --> 06:32:53.218 align:start position:0%
just for for when they're actually
 
06:32:54.890 --> 06:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
making a decision that they all should
 
06:32:56.390 --> 06:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
be they're not necessarily at every
 
06:32:58.190 --> 06:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
meeting and every hearing but at the
 
06:32:59.990 --> 06:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
time they're actually making a decision
 
06:33:04.010 --> 06:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
I I think all five should be there
 
06:33:06.670 --> 06:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
it's an idea with considering
 
06:33:09.530 --> 06:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
06:33:11.208 --> 06:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
may I suggest
 
06:33:12.770 --> 06:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
consider permitting remote meetings
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
especially as some of these decisions
 
06:33:16.970 --> 06:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
are only 15 minutes that might make it a
 
06:33:18.170 --> 06:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
lot easier to get all five people
 
06:33:20.410 --> 06:33:20.420 align:start position:0%
together at once
 
06:33:22.670 --> 06:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:33:25.670 --> 06:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
comment uh thank you just um something
 
06:33:27.470 --> 06:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
for the people who might be working on
 
06:33:29.990 --> 06:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment to consider on page four
 
06:33:33.410 --> 06:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
line 32 it says no public member nor any
 
06:33:35.150 --> 06:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
member of his or her family shall
 
06:33:37.850 --> 06:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
receive income from energy facilities
 
06:33:39.770 --> 06:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
within the jurisdiction of the committee
 
06:33:42.170 --> 06:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
are the puc members held to the same
 
06:33:42.180 --> 06:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
are the puc members held to the same
standard

06:33:50.390 --> 06:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:53.330 --> 06:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
so that's that's accepted language I
 
06:33:56.930 --> 06:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
mean but why why are we well okay
 
06:33:56.940 --> 06:33:58.368 align:start position:0%
mean but why why are we well okay
okay

06:33:58.368 --> 06:33:58.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:34:00.830 --> 06:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:02.448 --> 06:34:02.458 align:start position:0%
it's all resolved I'm sorry I was
 
06:34:04.128 --> 06:34:04.138 align:start position:0%
distracted by another conversation did
 
06:34:06.110 --> 06:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
you get your question answered I did
 
06:34:07.548 --> 06:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
um Meredith Hatfield did you have a
 
06:34:13.070 --> 06:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:15.288 --> 06:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
you have another question
 
06:34:15.298 --> 06:34:17.030 align:start position:0%
you have another question
okay

06:34:17.030 --> 06:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:34:20.690 --> 06:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so very much Mr chairman
 
06:34:22.610 --> 06:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
um on page 10
 
06:34:25.070 --> 06:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
um line five
 
06:34:27.890 --> 06:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
um this is where the doe will appoint
 
06:34:30.410 --> 06:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
the two members of the public
 
06:34:31.910 --> 06:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so if you did add members of the
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
public that's how they would be
 
06:34:33.120 --> 06:34:34.190 align:start position:0%
public that's how they would be
appointed

06:34:34.190 --> 06:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
06:34:34.200 --> 06:34:35.868 align:start position:0%
appointed
however

06:34:35.868 --> 06:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:34:37.970 --> 06:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
um right before that on line four it
 
06:34:40.128 --> 06:34:40.138 align:start position:0%
says the department shall be a party by
 
06:34:42.770 --> 06:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
right and so I think I don't think a
 
06:34:44.930 --> 06:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
party can
 
06:34:44.940 --> 06:34:45.590 align:start position:0%
party can
um

06:34:45.590 --> 06:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
appoint the judges on the case
 
06:34:54.350 --> 06:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
and so online page four line 28 you
 
06:34:54.360 --> 06:34:55.448 align:start position:0%
and so online page four line 28 you
address

06:34:55.448 --> 06:34:55.458 align:start position:0%
address
 
06:34:57.530 --> 06:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
how to
 
06:35:00.890 --> 06:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
um replace members of the public
 
06:35:05.570 --> 06:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
um with a random draw so I would that's
 
06:35:07.310 --> 06:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that it's a
 
06:35:09.530 --> 06:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
random draw but it's done by the by the
 
06:35:12.530 --> 06:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
commission or the new committee
 
06:35:15.410 --> 06:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:17.810 --> 06:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
um that's on page four
 
06:35:20.330 --> 06:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
um at line 30 so this this I think
 
06:35:22.610 --> 06:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
contemplates replacing a public member
 
06:35:24.650 --> 06:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
when that's necessary
 
06:35:26.570 --> 06:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so it talks about random draw from
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
the pool of public members
 
06:35:31.788 --> 06:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
um and it strikes me that a the
 
06:35:34.430 --> 06:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
department shouldn't be naming the
 
06:35:35.868 --> 06:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
public members because they are a party
 
06:35:38.690 --> 06:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
to the proceeding and then B that you
 
06:35:40.128 --> 06:35:40.138 align:start position:0%
already do have that random draw
 
06:35:40.138 --> 06:35:41.448 align:start position:0%
already do have that random draw
language

06:35:41.448 --> 06:35:41.458 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:35:43.490 --> 06:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so that might be a good way to to
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
have the commission or the new body that
 
06:35:47.930 --> 06:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
you might create choose the public
 
06:35:49.368 --> 06:35:49.378 align:start position:0%
member so I just wanted to mention that
 
06:35:51.170 --> 06:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
for if you are going to be working on an
 
06:35:51.180 --> 06:35:53.448 align:start position:0%
for if you are going to be working on an
amendment

06:35:53.448 --> 06:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:00.770 --> 06:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
where was that second set of language I
 
06:36:04.970 --> 06:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
was uh my apologies but I uh your name
 
06:36:07.010 --> 06:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly representative
 
06:36:09.288 --> 06:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
Kelly you have a question
 
06:36:11.150 --> 06:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
yes where was the random trial language
 
06:36:14.690 --> 06:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
I was looking for 162h has
 
06:36:18.910 --> 06:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:22.730 --> 06:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
okay has some public about the the
 
06:36:24.948 --> 06:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
public process of drawing members and I
 
06:36:26.270 --> 06:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know if it would just be easy to
 
06:36:30.650 --> 06:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
copy that over from 162h the existing
 
06:36:33.230 --> 06:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
RSA about the site evaluation committee
 
06:36:45.590 --> 06:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:56.270 --> 06:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:58.910 --> 06:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay before I call on anybody else for
 
06:37:00.770 --> 06:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
questions I need to
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
brief the committee on a conversation I
 
06:37:06.470 --> 06:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:08.390 --> 06:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
because we're fast approaching the
 
06:37:10.970 --> 06:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
deadline the clerk says that we have to
 
06:37:13.970 --> 06:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
finish this bill today
 
06:37:17.150 --> 06:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
we do not have the option of trying to
 
06:37:19.788 --> 06:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
do more work on it tomorrow and
 
06:37:19.798 --> 06:37:21.530 align:start position:0%
do more work on it tomorrow and
Wednesday

06:37:21.530 --> 06:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
06:37:24.530 --> 06:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
we have to finish it today
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
so that gives us two options it's now 20
 
06:37:30.590 --> 06:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:33.948 --> 06:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
we can notify OLS that we need a
 
06:37:36.230 --> 06:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney to stay late
 
06:37:39.230 --> 06:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
and we can sit here and try to come up
 
06:37:41.930 --> 06:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
with new language and get it over to
 
06:37:41.940 --> 06:37:43.128 align:start position:0%
with new language and get it over to
them

06:37:43.128 --> 06:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:37:44.690 --> 06:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
so that they can come up with a new
 
06:37:46.250 --> 06:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
version of the amendment
 
06:37:48.470 --> 06:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
and then we could vote on it
 
06:37:52.010 --> 06:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
when that new version comes back
 
06:37:54.470 --> 06:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
it might keep us here till five six
 
06:37:56.810 --> 06:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
maybe even seven o'clock
 
06:37:59.270 --> 06:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
to get to that point
 
06:38:04.190 --> 06:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
so uh that really is our only option at
 
06:38:06.110 --> 06:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
this point in time
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
so do we have any appetite to do that
 
06:38:11.208 --> 06:38:11.218 align:start position:0%
could I see a show of hands of people
 
06:38:14.270 --> 06:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
who are willing to stay
 
06:38:14.280 --> 06:38:16.250 align:start position:0%
who are willing to stay
um

06:38:16.250 --> 06:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
before I asked for that show of hands
 
06:38:19.730 --> 06:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
let me just brief representative
 
06:38:23.750 --> 06:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
McWilliams on the situation I just spoke
 
06:38:26.810 --> 06:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
with the house Clerk and he tells me
 
06:38:29.030 --> 06:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we have to finish this bill today
 
06:38:31.490 --> 06:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
we do not have the option of working on
 
06:38:33.830 --> 06:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
it tomorrow and Wednesday
 
06:38:38.448 --> 06:38:38.458 align:start position:0%
and so our only option is to notify OLS
 
06:38:40.490 --> 06:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
today that we will need a drafting
 
06:38:42.530 --> 06:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
attorney to stay late
 
06:38:44.628 --> 06:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
try to come up with any changes we want
 
06:38:47.270 --> 06:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
to make and get them over to OLS
 
06:38:50.390 --> 06:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
get a Amendment back here stay here as
 
06:38:52.190 --> 06:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
long as we have to so that we can vote
 
06:38:54.288 --> 06:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
06:38:54.298 --> 06:38:55.788 align:start position:0%
on this bill
so

06:38:55.788 --> 06:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:55.798 --> 06:38:57.288 align:start position:0%
so
uh

06:38:57.288 --> 06:38:57.298 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:38:59.030 --> 06:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get a show of hands of
 
06:39:02.330 --> 06:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
people who are all right representative
 
06:39:05.448 --> 06:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh thank you Mr chair I just want
 
06:39:07.910 --> 06:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
to make one one comment uh
 
06:39:10.548 --> 06:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
I would be very much in favor of doing
 
06:39:12.590 --> 06:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
that if I thought that it would produce
 
06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
a result but one of the things I'm I'm
 
06:39:18.350 --> 06:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
questioning is even if we did that and
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
came up with good language we're not
 
06:39:24.110 --> 06:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:26.868 --> 06:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's that's my concern and if that and
 
06:39:28.910 --> 06:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
if that's a concern of the others hear
 
06:39:31.010 --> 06:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
it that in which case that they would
 
06:39:33.410 --> 06:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
not want to vote on it then then I we'd
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
be wasting our time
 
06:39:37.548 --> 06:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right that's although I would
 
06:39:42.350 --> 06:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
gladly stay here longer if we could
 
06:39:44.690 --> 06:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
produce a vote
 
06:39:44.700 --> 06:39:45.770 align:start position:0%
produce a vote
okay

06:39:45.770 --> 06:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
so let's have a show of hands raise your
 
06:39:49.548 --> 06:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
hand if you're willing to stay late
 
06:39:52.970 --> 06:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
tonight and work on a revised amendment
 
06:39:55.368 --> 06:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
that we could vote on before we left
 
06:39:58.910 --> 06:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
Concord this evening
 
06:40:00.948 --> 06:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
show of hands
 
06:40:00.958 --> 06:40:09.048 align:start position:0%
show of hands
one

06:40:09.048 --> 06:40:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:13.070 --> 06:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay we have nine members voting uh to
 
06:40:15.048 --> 06:40:15.058 align:start position:0%
stay and work on this
 
06:40:17.868 --> 06:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
that would imply that 11 members are not
 
06:40:20.410 --> 06:40:20.420 align:start position:0%
willing to stay and work on this
 
06:40:23.390 --> 06:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
comment um representative Harrington I
 
06:40:23.400 --> 06:40:24.410 align:start position:0%
comment um representative Harrington I
think

06:40:24.410 --> 06:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:40:26.090 --> 06:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
um you know we have two ways of looking
 
06:40:29.330 --> 06:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
at it we can get it we can get a rush uh
 
06:40:31.788 --> 06:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment out which we know won't cover
 
06:40:33.230 --> 06:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
everything that we think needs to be
 
06:40:35.330 --> 06:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
covered and put that out and then go
 
06:40:36.650 --> 06:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and tell them we're
 
06:40:39.288 --> 06:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
going to uh try to work with them to fix
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
it which is not actually the preferred
 
06:40:43.730 --> 06:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
way we like to do business but we could
 
06:40:45.650 --> 06:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
also just put out what we have and put
 
06:40:46.850 --> 06:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
it over to the Senate and say we're
 
06:40:47.930 --> 06:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
going to go over there and work with
 
06:40:49.610 --> 06:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
them on it to try to fix it because I
 
06:40:50.990 --> 06:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
think the bait one of the beefiest thing
 
06:40:52.430 --> 06:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
is this the word commission versus
 
06:40:54.770 --> 06:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee it's all over the thing I've
 
06:40:57.288 --> 06:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
been looking through it and it implies
 
06:40:58.970 --> 06:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
that the commission is somehow separate
 
06:41:00.650 --> 06:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the two public members
 
06:41:02.090 --> 06:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be public members it
 
06:41:03.890 --> 06:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
should be committee which is made up of
 
06:41:06.288 --> 06:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and the public members
 
06:41:07.310 --> 06:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and there's probably some other
 
06:41:09.530 --> 06:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
things in here as well I'm just not I
 
06:41:11.150 --> 06:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's worth the time and
 
06:41:13.250 --> 06:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
effort to put over something that we
 
06:41:14.448 --> 06:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
rushed through in the next couple of
 
06:41:16.128 --> 06:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
hours that we know is probably not going
 
06:41:18.410 --> 06:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
to be the whole fix anyways and if we're
 
06:41:19.910 --> 06:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to tell the senate if we're
 
06:41:22.368 --> 06:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
sending you something with needs work
 
06:41:24.110 --> 06:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
well we tell them something that needs a
 
06:41:25.250 --> 06:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
little bit more work I mean that's the
 
06:41:26.150 --> 06:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
only difference we're talking about
 
06:41:27.590 --> 06:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get it right in the
 
06:41:30.230 --> 06:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:33.650 --> 06:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna with uh withdraw my
 
06:41:33.660 --> 06:41:34.970 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna with uh withdraw my
Amendment

06:41:34.970 --> 06:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:41:37.490 --> 06:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
and my motion to
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and make a new Amendment
 
06:41:44.628 --> 06:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
a new motion and that motion is retained
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:52.788 --> 06:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded to retain House Bill
 
06:41:52.798 --> 06:41:54.230 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded to retain House Bill
609

06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
609
 
06:41:57.288 --> 06:41:57.298 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
06:41:59.330 --> 06:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah we've been looking with this for
 
06:42:02.270 --> 06:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
a long time and I know I hate to say
 
06:42:04.250 --> 06:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
well we'll put it up one more time but I
 
06:42:06.350 --> 06:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
think in this case since a there isn't
 
06:42:08.090 --> 06:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
anything specifically on the docket
 
06:42:11.690 --> 06:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
right now that's pending uh and B we
 
06:42:13.548 --> 06:42:13.558 align:start position:0%
need to get this right and if that means
 
06:42:15.350 --> 06:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
waiting a few more months before it to
 
06:42:17.270 --> 06:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
happen or I guess we've more than that
 
06:42:18.890 --> 06:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
six months whatever
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
um it's probably worth the effort to do
 
06:42:21.530 --> 06:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
it right
 
06:42:23.810 --> 06:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I think this committee probably has
 
06:42:26.090 --> 06:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
more expertise than probably the people
 
06:42:27.770 --> 06:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and certainly has more
 
06:42:29.390 --> 06:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
time to deal with the bill that's just
 
06:42:30.890 --> 06:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
complicated because let's face it
 
06:42:32.930 --> 06:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's only 24 senators and we've got
 
06:42:34.610 --> 06:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
almost that many people right here so
 
06:42:37.448 --> 06:42:37.458 align:start position:0%
and that's not so you know
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
06:42:41.570 --> 06:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I wholeheartedly believe
 
06:42:43.070 --> 06:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
with the comments of Representative
 
06:42:46.610 --> 06:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh to which uh my only other
 
06:42:48.590 --> 06:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
two comments would be so I would hope
 
06:42:50.990 --> 06:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
you'd also have time to have some
 
06:42:53.690 --> 06:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
additional public input on something
 
06:42:55.490 --> 06:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's approaching a finished version of
 
06:42:57.890 --> 06:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
the bill and the others I'm looking
 
06:43:00.650 --> 06:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
forward to in a a discussion on whether
 
06:43:03.230 --> 06:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
how the public involvement uh on this
 
06:43:07.730 --> 06:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:10.250 --> 06:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Brown has accomplished
 
06:43:11.930 --> 06:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:43:15.948 --> 06:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
um I agree mainly from what I heard this
 
06:43:15.958 --> 06:43:16.788 align:start position:0%
um I agree mainly from what I heard this
morning

06:43:16.788 --> 06:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
morning
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
there were so many people in the back of
 
06:43:20.990 --> 06:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
the room that said we really would like
 
06:43:23.690 --> 06:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
to see this amendment and think that we
 
06:43:26.510 --> 06:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
could at least have considered it and so
 
06:43:30.590 --> 06:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:35.390 --> 06:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:37.610 --> 06:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
06:43:39.650 --> 06:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of retain house
 
06:43:41.628 --> 06:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
bill 609.

do we want to work on this bill with a
 
06:44:36.890 --> 06:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or do we want to work on it
 
06:44:39.470 --> 06:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
with the full committee
 
06:44:42.530 --> 06:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:45.230 --> 06:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams how many
 
06:44:47.330 --> 06:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
members would a subcommittee be
 
06:44:50.150 --> 06:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
typically you do five or seven
 
06:44:50.160 --> 06:44:53.150 align:start position:0%
typically you do five or seven
okay

06:44:53.150 --> 06:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:55.190 --> 06:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Christian
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
the full committee would be appropriate
 
06:44:56.878 --> 06:44:59.930 align:start position:0%
the full committee would be appropriate
personal

06:44:59.930 --> 06:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:02.628 --> 06:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman I agree with
 
06:45:07.788 --> 06:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
representative creation
 
06:45:10.548 --> 06:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
06:45:12.470 --> 06:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
chair um this is one of the bills that
 
06:45:14.750 --> 06:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
we've received the most input from uh
 
06:45:16.730 --> 06:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
from the public and so I would go with
 
06:45:21.170 --> 06:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:23.930 --> 06:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay I think that seems to be the
 
06:45:27.170 --> 06:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
consensus then that this will be a full
 
06:45:27.180 --> 06:45:29.230 align:start position:0%
consensus then that this will be a full
committee

06:45:29.230 --> 06:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:45:33.650 --> 06:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility come October or September
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%

and I will be in charge of organiz
 
06:45:40.490 --> 06:45:40.500 align:start position:0%

come back here and we'll hammer out this
 
06:45:49.610 --> 06:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
language until we get it right
 
06:45:52.070 --> 06:45:52.080 align:start position:0%

06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is it um can we ask
 
06:46:34.850 --> 06:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there might be some work done
 
06:46:37.610 --> 06:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh unofficially over the summer on
 
06:46:40.128 --> 06:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
getting some new words on this but can
 
06:46:42.670 --> 06:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
we ask that for whenever that first
 
06:46:44.750 --> 06:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting is or full work
 
06:46:47.628 --> 06:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
session is is it possible to get some
 
06:46:51.830 --> 06:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note submitted at least then uh
 
06:46:58.430 --> 06:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:01.310 --> 06:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
Mr elves thank you Mr chairman
 
06:47:03.770 --> 06:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
um we could provide that information we
 
06:47:05.570 --> 06:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
would just need to know what information
 
06:47:08.330 --> 06:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
you would like you know so what is are
 
06:47:10.788 --> 06:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
we basing it off of the bill as it is
 
06:47:13.128 --> 06:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
today with this amendment
 
06:47:16.010 --> 06:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
and then sort of there are questions on
 
06:47:17.868 --> 06:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
you know what you would want to know but
 
06:47:19.788 --> 06:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
yes we can provide whatever you need
 
06:47:19.798 --> 06:47:23.090 align:start position:0%
yes we can provide whatever you need
as

06:47:23.090 --> 06:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:26.330 --> 06:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
as Mr Spock said or was said
 
06:47:30.948 --> 06:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
his best guess is what is what I would
 
06:47:34.070 --> 06:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
put my life on so whatever your best
 
06:47:37.128 --> 06:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
guess is at that time I think it's
 
06:47:38.570 --> 06:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
something Captain Kirk said that
 
06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually uh bone said that but anyway uh
 
06:47:43.730 --> 06:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
I would I would say what your whatever
 
06:47:45.288 --> 06:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
your best kiss would be given the
 
06:47:48.350 --> 06:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
information you know as a up that point
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
would be a starting point and obviously
 
06:47:53.090 --> 06:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
as the uh work of that subcommer or the
 
06:47:54.948 --> 06:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
committee evolves we would be happy to
 
06:47:57.650 --> 06:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
update and provide further information
 
06:48:00.590 --> 06:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
as necessary
 
06:48:03.170 --> 06:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
just for clarity we're not doing a
 
06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill we're doing a
 
06:48:07.250 --> 06:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
full committee work session probably
 
06:48:12.170 --> 06:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:14.510 --> 06:48:14.520 align:start position:0%

06:48:45.650 --> 06:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams this concludes
 
06:48:47.448 --> 06:48:47.458 align:start position:0%

06:48:54.048 --> 06:48:54.058 align:start position:0%
just concluded so well done
 
06:48:54.058 --> 06:48:57.368 align:start position:0%
just concluded so well done
absolutely

06:48:57.368 --> 06:48:57.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:59.810 --> 06:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has an
 
06:49:02.930 --> 06:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
announcement yes since we no longer have
 
06:49:05.628 --> 06:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh bills to act on until at least
 
06:49:09.948 --> 06:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
crossover I am open to any suggestion if
 
06:49:12.650 --> 06:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
we would like to come here on a regular
 
06:49:15.948 --> 06:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
day say Monday possibly Tuesday and
 
06:49:19.070 --> 06:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
either do a presentation on an item that
 
06:49:22.730 --> 06:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
is of um uh pertinence to this uh
 
06:49:26.090 --> 06:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
committee or weather permitting maybe
 
06:49:29.390 --> 06:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
there could be a short uh road trip to
 
06:49:31.510 --> 06:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
some facility
 
06:49:34.070 --> 06:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
Perhaps Perhaps a resources control
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
center that's not a far drive from here
 
06:49:38.990 --> 06:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
but uh if you'd like to give me some of
 
06:49:41.150 --> 06:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
your ideas I know one idea that was
 
06:49:43.128 --> 06:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
presented by representative munz was to
 
06:49:47.090 --> 06:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
have a presentation on AI here I I'm not
 
06:49:49.090 --> 06:49:49.100 align:start position:0%
quite sure
 
06:49:51.468 --> 06:49:51.478 align:start position:0%
when they could get the person here or
 
06:49:53.270 --> 06:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
or if the other committee would like to
 
06:49:55.490 --> 06:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
hear that but certainly a trip to say
 
06:49:58.788 --> 06:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
the eversources control center is always
 
06:50:01.968 --> 06:50:01.978 align:start position:0%
of interest because of what they do and
 
06:50:04.730 --> 06:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
if anybody else has a suggestion I'll
 
06:50:07.128 --> 06:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
take it get some ideas perhaps by the
 
06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
end of this week and we can start things
 
06:50:08.878 --> 06:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
end of this week and we can start things
going

06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:14.448 --> 06:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
06:50:16.430 --> 06:50:16.440 align:start position:0%

06:50:20.590 --> 06:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
