also uh they state as we heard in
 
00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
also uh they state as we heard in
testimony

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
from a few different people that the
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
department had just culminated a
 
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
department had just culminated a
multi-year

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
multi-year
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
nash stream forest management plan
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
and this opening up more trails
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
was not part of that discussion in fact
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
they specifically rejected
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
the in the management plan rejected that
 
00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.830 align:start position:0%
the in the management plan rejected that
uh

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
process

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
comments from the committee anything to
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
add anything to say
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
a move
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
are you taking motions
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
um i've raised my hand
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
oh okay i see uh representative renzolo
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
has raised his hand and representative
 
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
has raised his hand and representative
spang

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
spang
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
we are just to answer your question um
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
this is a work session so we're not
 
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
this is a work session so we're not
really

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
i mean we can i think we should have a
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
little more discussion before we do a
 
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.390 align:start position:0%
little more discussion before we do a
motion

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative renzolo yes if you
 
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.150 align:start position:0%
yes representative renzolo yes if you
recall

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill also had
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh as part of the uh the hearing
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
there was a a amendment
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
introduced to it concerning hoyt pond in
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
concord which is
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know very different from the bill
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
itself and in fact the
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
amendment at hoyt pond had more
 
00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:32.949 align:start position:0%
amendment at hoyt pond had more
discussion

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
and more public input than the actual
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
original text of the bill
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the the issue
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill is with that and that
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment even though we did not
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
pass that amendment because we didn't i
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't think we ever came to a vote on it
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
that this whole the whole issue
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
together uh this should be taken this
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
this discussion should also include
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
that amendment and my feeling personally
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
is that we should make just no
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
and if someone wants to bring something
 
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.829 align:start position:0%
and if someone wants to bring something
back

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
just let it happen uh but
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't take a position on it
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
because we really haven't uh
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
haven't come to a conclusion on uh
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh on on the on the uh
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
on any on on much of anything as far as
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we're ever going to
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
get to duke to be able to do that
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the time allotted so just let it
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
let it go on to uh next year if somebody
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
wants to bring it back
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
fine if not fine too
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative ghouls
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
oh you have to unmute yourself
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i understand what andy is
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
saying and uh
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
it seems as though there are like two
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
bills in this bill
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh both hoytmash and uh where i have
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
visited as a matter of fact
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
and then uh the nash stream forest and
 
00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.110 align:start position:0%
and then uh the nash stream forest and
uh

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
as you just mentioned the management
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
plan uh
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh does not permit it and then h.b 660
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
enacted last year requires in dnci to
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
prepare master plan for ohrb
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
trails and cross county that was some of
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
our testimony that we received
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
so it seems as though there's work i
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
guess you'd have to say that has to be
 
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.350 align:start position:0%
guess you'd have to say that has to be
done

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
or that uh these uh
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
studies are involved with am i correct
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
in saying that
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
well the the um regarding the amendment
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was brought in about the
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
hoyt pond uh weight road pond
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
the committee did not adopt that
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment but one of the reasons we did
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
vote to interim study
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
is because of that issue and we hoped
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
to like have a field trip and go out
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
there and work on it and call in
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and because of the
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic we pretty much were not able to
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
do any of that
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
so we haven't learned anything new since
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
in my in my mind i hoped to get down
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
there this summer
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
and take a look at it and and look at
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
the wildlife and look at the situation
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
there but
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to so i mean the
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's you know but the but the nash
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
stream one yeah there's work already
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
being done on all of those issues
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
and it seems like that that part of the
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
bill is definitely
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
which is the only bill we have before us
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't prevent us from making
 
00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't prevent us from making
comments

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative spang thank you and then
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative noel and representative
 
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.230 align:start position:0%
representative noel and representative
cohen

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
cohen
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i may not be seeing your hands in
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
a timely fashion
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is a uh just a
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh of logistics or whether
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of how we
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
talk about this i there was a nice word
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
for that and it's not coming to me
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
but um i i'm confused about the status
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um i think
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative renzullo said it was not
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
it was not formally introduced
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
which is different from our saying that
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
it was not adopted
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
if it was not formally introduced then
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's not really part of this bill
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is under those
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we should
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
not address it since it's not part of
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we should encourage anyone who wants
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
to pick up on that
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
issue to bring in a bill next year
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
that deals with this as a legitimate
 
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
that deals with this as a legitimate
bill

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
um representative renzolo
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative i mean noelle
 
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.550 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative i mean noelle
and

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
cohen with their hands up and then i'll
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
get to you but joel did you have
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
something to say
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
just on this one point about it being uh
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not the amendment was
 
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
whether or not the amendment was
formally

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
formally
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
introduced um i believe the committee
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually had a
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
a separate public hearing on the
 
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
a separate public hearing on the
amendment

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
after the original public hearing on the
 
00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:37.990 align:start position:0%
after the original public hearing on the
bill

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
so in that sense it was certainly
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
formally before the committee
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative noel
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair uh
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
thinking looking at the information that
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
we we have on the
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
nash stream portion of hp 1316
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
the nash stream management plan a is a
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
body a multi-member
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
body who's tasked with uh responsibility
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
of evaluating the use of that
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
that property and i know that the local
 
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
that property and i know that the local
club

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
club
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
followed their their procedures in
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
making an application
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
to make a bypass route to get the ohrv
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
traffic off the roads and it was a
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
pretty thorough
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
piece of work in their submission
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
said the nash stream management
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
group considered the use
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
of the nastream property
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
not an appropriate use by ohrvs of the
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
nat stream property not an appropriate
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
use and decided
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
not to allow the modification the trail
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
modification requested
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that's appropriate because
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is the structure that was
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
established when nash stream
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
was put in place uh i believe this
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill comes at
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
the whole issue from the legislative
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
point of view and
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
and by fiat is trying to determine that
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
a no hrd trail can be placed in
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
nash stream which i don't think is a
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
good precedent
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh it is actually the
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
same issue we're considering with the
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
hoyt road marsh
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
where the the senate
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
finance committee preemptively
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
deemed that motorcycles would not be
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
allowed on the marsh
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
by legislative fiat no public hearing
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
was held
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
it was just determined arbitrarily
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
so i am i'm predisposed to
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
to not uh allowing
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
ohrv trails on ride the wilds or not
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative cohen and
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
then representative renzolo
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chairperson
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes i've i've
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
gone through all the information that
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
we've been presented
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and although we're not voting at this
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
and although we're not voting at this
time

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
as a workshop i would say that i see
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
that the amendment
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
if we were voting on that and the um
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
original bill on that stream
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
are both attacks on our environment and
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
as a steward
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
of the environment the people of new
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire i can't support either of
 
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire i can't support either of
those

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
and if there was a motion to not
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
pass these bills whatever that motion
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
would be i would
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
definitely absolutely support let it not
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
passing me not recommending these bills
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
revised for the next year by somebody
 
00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:49.110 align:start position:0%
revised for the next year by somebody
else

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
um i just before we before we get to
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative renzolo
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
um joel uh wendy thomas has written that
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
she can't find the link and asks you to
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
send it
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
if you haven't done that already okay
 
00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
if you haven't done that already okay
representative

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
yes got me now can you hear me now
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh i think
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
with the it has been brought out that we
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
did have a here
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing on this in fact if
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken maybe i
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
got my times my dates mixed up wasn't
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
this part of the joint hearing that we
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay but but at any at any rate
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
the issue around the hoyt pond
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
and how that whole business was uh
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
went down and how that that change in
 
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
went down and how that that change in
use

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
occurred has real
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
merit and
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
that was part of the the that was of
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
was an important part of the discussion
 
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
was an important part of the discussion
and

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
if we if we vote just to not
 
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.909 align:start position:0%
if we if we vote just to not
recommend

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
or or to vote but basically vote against
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh the passage of the bill or
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
not in favor of the bill rather
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's it is it puts
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is also a vote again a vote for
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
the way that change and use occurred
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i propose what i'm proposing is that
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
we just simply have no recommendation
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then if someone wants to bring bring
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
up the
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
white pond issue that's
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
they can do it without it being uh
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
pre-prejudiced by this by the uh the
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
vote of this committee
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
the the choices we have
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
are we recommend this for future
 
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
are we recommend this for future
legislation

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i use the term loosely we recommend
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
this issue for future legislation or we
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
do not recommend this for future
 
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
do not recommend this for future
legislation

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
those are the two choices you can't say
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're not making any recommendation
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
you have to do one or the other and
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
one of the possible ones would be to not
 
00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:26.710 align:start position:0%
one of the possible ones would be to not
recommend

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation on the bill as
 
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
future legislation on the bill as
introduced

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
however the committee did hear testimony
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
on an amendment which was brought in
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh and if we were not able to study it
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
and if someone wishes to bring
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
a bill in related to that
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you'd write it even but
 
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you'd write it even but
um

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know to say the bill is introduced
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
we do not recommend
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
however we should address i think
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
because one of the reasons we voted to
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
interim study the bill
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
was to review this issue
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the ice racing so i
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
think somehow that needs to be
 
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.430 align:start position:0%
think somehow that needs to be
incorporated

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
incorporated
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
with our we don't recommend for the bill
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
but there are other issues that should
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
possibly be discussed
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to word it but i mean
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
does that sound correct to you
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative renzo
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
it sounds correct but you know the
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
the you know it's all it's all about our
 
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
the you know it's all it's all about our
wording

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah what is it depends how it's
 
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:39.909 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah what is it depends how it's
worded

00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
worded
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
i mean uh i don't want to
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
prejudice somebody's of somebody's
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh project pre-prejudice this bill
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh leased the part around point pond if
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
it right
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
because the whole business didn't the
 
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.149 align:start position:0%
because the whole business didn't the
whole

00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
adjudication of that did not go through
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
the proper channels
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
i mean it was done by it was it was
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
stuck onto
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
hb2 and it was we never even knew about
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
it and neither did the people
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
so it was it was an affront to the way
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
we do that we do business in the
 
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
we do that we do business in the
legislature

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
and if someone wants to bring that up
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to prejudice that
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.950 align:start position:0%
at all
okay

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
sorry let's get this down i couldn't
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
agree more
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
with with representative renzolo
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
um it really infuriates me
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
that um that this sleight of hand was
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
carried on
 
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.050 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
with it
[Music]

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a sneak attack
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
on the the residents of that area
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
and also the users that's not to say
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
that i think that
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
racing motorcycles on hoyt pond
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh is something that if it were a
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
decision that were being made
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
afresh that i would think
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
that it was a good idea
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that from an ecological
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
i feel that it is particularly damaging
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be having uses on ice we certainly
 
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.390 align:start position:0%
to be having uses on ice we certainly
allow

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles on ice we allow uh
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
huge car races on winnipesaukee
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
so in my mind and from an environmental
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
i don't have any big problems with it i
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of public recreation and we
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
keep coming up against this
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
motorized recreation and the
 
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
motorized recreation and the
neighborhoods

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that there are
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be resolved but
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
certainly more equitably if this were
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
an issue that was being tacked on
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
and by finance for something that we
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
were absolutely against
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
say opening up nash stream
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think that we would be we would be up
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
in arms
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
that said um
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
i do agree with representative ren zullo
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
that it would be great if we could put
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
something in our report
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
that indicated that we weren't thrilled
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
with this way of doing things that we
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
maybe we could put it tactfully and i'm
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
sure there are other people who are
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
better at tack than i am
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
but it would um say something like
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
because the issue was because of the way
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
this was enacted
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
we feel that it was never uh
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
it was never vetted the way it needed to
 
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
it was never vetted the way it needed to
be

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
and um we would not you know
 
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
and um we would not you know
[Music]

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that if it continues to
 
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.110 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that if it continues to
be

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
a problematic issue that um
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation be brought forward to enable
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
um this to be looked at more fully the
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
other question is
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
does fish and game need to have
 
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.909 align:start position:0%
does fish and game need to have
legislation

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
and um that's another you know i don't
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
know whether where they're standing
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
on this whether they'd be inclined to do
 
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.350 align:start position:0%
on this whether they'd be inclined to do
it

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
without legislation um
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be really great to make the
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
the senate have a task force on it
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
but uh you know either at any rate my
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
point is we should have
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
a little something in there that says
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
we think that the this was not done
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
and an open process that needs to still
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
happen on the
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the things you've brought up
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
judith um
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
are related to things we would have
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
done in an interim study yes if we had
 
00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:33.669 align:start position:0%
done in an interim study yes if we had
the

00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
if we had the space and time and
 
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.710 align:start position:0%
if we had the space and time and
everything

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
um representative grassy if you're
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh if if we do choose to
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
are we also voting on the amendment at
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
the vote is whether to recommend for
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
future legislation on the original bill
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
or not recommend legislation on the
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
included in the report
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
could be would be which is kind of what
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
i was getting at with a straw vote
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
um something about the
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the amendment which did have
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
a public hearing but we never
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
that make sense that makes sense yeah
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
that makes sense thank you
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
so representative smith yes i'm sorry
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
i i kind of missed i was doing something
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
else are you talking about doing a straw
 
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.149 align:start position:0%
else are you talking about doing a straw
poll

00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
poll
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that or yeah i'm just a little
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
worried about
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of i guess it wasn't
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
consider to vote or not um or if you
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
just um
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh because then it's supposed to be a
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
roll call um
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
so it's fine to take a a vote on it um
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little worried about people
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you can kind of come to consensus or
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
you could kind of ask people
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
does that make sense sort of and maybe
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
yeah but i think that's what i'll do
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
anything that kind of getting close to a
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
vote um you need to be careful about
 
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
vote um you need to be careful about
yeah

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative maze and then
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative hobson
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
and representative mays you have to yeah
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
i i think if we were going to be looking
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
at a not recommended refugee legislation
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
um i could be comfortable with that
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
because hoyt pond is not going to go
 
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.190 align:start position:0%
because hoyt pond is not going to go
away

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
that legislative there is going to be
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to come back
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
next term on that that particular issue
 
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
next term on that that particular issue
uh

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh if if only
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
by the by the folks that don't want it
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to get some
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
counteraction on the folks that really
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
are passionate about
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
using that that facility for that so
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh if we're looking at a general kind of
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh feeling i would be comfortable in
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
going with our
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
are not recommended not recommending for
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
future legislation because we're pretty
 
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:39.350 align:start position:0%
future legislation because we're pretty
much

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable what the nash stream folks
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
have done up there
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
and and their commission in looking for
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
the welfare of their area
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
so i think we're good on what we've
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
talked about in the committee
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
okay and just to clarify um the law now
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
states that you cannot
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
be on your motorcycle on the ice
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
in concord on hoyt road pond
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
um let's see representative hobson
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i just wanted
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
to say that i echo
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
the um statements of representative
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
spang and
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative ron zulo um
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a confusing issue to me
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
because i haven't seen the actual spot
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so a field trip for sure would be
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh would clear it up for me because i'm
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
a visual person but
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah i so i'll just leave it at that
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
i could go on but
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah i mean the
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
um if the if we are all on the committee
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
um starting in january
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
we could do a winter field trip and see
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
what it looks like in the winter without
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
the ice skating but just to see what it
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
is and then
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
um and you know and because i'm sure
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
legislation introduced about this issue
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
and we just need to i think in our
 
00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
and we just need to i think in our
report

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that we understand this is an
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
issue that needs further study
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
but the major but the main part of the
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill we don't recommend so it's
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a challenging thing we have
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who would like to speak
 
00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.149 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who would like to speak
and

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
say they agree or don't agree or
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
whatever and then we can end the work
 
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.190 align:start position:0%
whatever and then we can end the work
sessions

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
so representative horgan are you feeling
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
i love your northern lights behind you
 
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
i love your northern lights behind you
um

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
are you okay with what has been
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
discussed uh
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
by representative renzolo and
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative spang
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
i am my recommendation would be uh for
 
00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.029 align:start position:0%
i am my recommendation would be uh for
not

00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
future legislation okay
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'm here and what do you think are you
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%

discussed

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
discussed

everything has been discussed i agree
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
with and um
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think this thing should go any
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
further than it already has
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh it needs a lot more work and as
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
one person said it's going to keep
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
coming back and back and back so
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
um i'm in complete compliance with
 
00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:33.909 align:start position:0%
um i'm in complete compliance with
everyone

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
president spang and uh president renzo
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
different nothing's changed in my mind
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the last four minutes no
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i agree uh with um what
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
representative spanning representative
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
zulu said i think we need to um you know
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
let this one run its course now
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
and and and let it go for what happens
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
down the line
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay and representative yvonne thomas
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have to unmute yeah i did uh no i
 
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.509 align:start position:0%
you have to unmute yeah i did uh no i
agree

agree
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think that this was like a backdoor
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.909 align:start position:0%
it really should come up before the
committee

yes i agree with renzo representative
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
ren solo et cetera
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay and representative feeney
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes i agree also because of the
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
amendment and how it was before
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay and representative harm
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes i'm in agreement with uh
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative ren zulu and
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative spang
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
for all the comments that were
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
previously made okay and representative
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
wrong i see you have your hand up
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i also wanted to state my agreement
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
with the consensus
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee i think the issues
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
raised in this bill can be best
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
addressed through different bills that
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
are are more specific to the issue
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill should just
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
should just go away and i don't
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
recommend this
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
this specific bill moving forward you
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
mean the ride the wilds part
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and representative wendy
 
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and representative wendy
thomas

00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes well i'm a little late to this party
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
but um based on the discussion that i've
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
heard and the discussions that we've had
 
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.190 align:start position:0%
heard and the discussions that we've had
previously

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'm in full agreement okay and i think
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative hobson you already made
 
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
representative hobson you already made
your

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
point but okay
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
did i miss anybody representative mays i
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
think you had already spoken
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative spang has her hand up
 
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.630 align:start position:0%
representative spang has her hand up
again

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
yep done mute sorry
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
um the whole thing where we're talking
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
about how we think it ought to be
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
that it ought to be looked at further
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
which seems to fly in the face of our
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
we don't recommend it for further
 
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.470 align:start position:0%
we don't recommend it for further
legislation

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
the only the only bill we're really
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
voting on is is the ride the wilds part
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
the nash stream
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
the other is
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
not in the bill so you can't really
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
right but we're talking about what we
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
might want to put in our
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
blurb yeah thinking that um
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not i i would feel comfortable about
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
saying not being comfortable with
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
future legislation until we
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
have given fish and game the opportunity
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
to look into this um on in their own
 
00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:26.630 align:start position:0%
to look into this um on in their own
terms

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
so i would say we don't need future
 
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.470 align:start position:0%
so i would say we don't need future
legislation

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
unless fish and game said that they're
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
not able to deal with it on their own
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it has to be done in
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislation because
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
legislation is what outlawed the
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
motorcycle riding on the pond
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
right so it's in statute
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
so i mean at the very least the study
 
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:51.990 align:start position:0%
so i mean at the very least the study
committee

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
on ice racing on ponds in new hampshire
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know but or else to you know but
 
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.470 align:start position:0%
you know but or else to you know but
that's

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
we don't need to get into the
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of what a piece of
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
legislation would look like
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
i in my opinion my thought is we just
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to recognize
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we understand this is an important
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
issue to some people
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that more work needs to be done on
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
we don't even have an amendment it's
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of a nebulous
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
thing there okay thank you
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
does that make sense yeah yes chris
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion on this uh
 
00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:30.230 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion on this uh
bill

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
if not i'll close the work session on
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
and move on to
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.950 align:start position:0%
and move on to
[Music]

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1426 is requiring an
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
off-highway recreational vehicle club to
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
have certain tests performed on a rail
 
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.390 align:start position:0%
have certain tests performed on a rail
trail

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
trail
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
and open for discussions i would like to
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative thomas yes thank you
 
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.230 align:start position:0%
yes representative thomas yes thank you
um

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
so when this bill was originally uh put
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
in it was
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
specifically because of the ohrv
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
traffic causing a lot of dust um and a
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
lot of noise
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh which impacted a butters health
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
um but then it was raised that um
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's other other people use rail
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
trails that
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
that um like electric bikes and and
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
horses and that kind of stuff that
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
raised dust
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so this bill although it's well
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
intentioned i don't think it should go
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere and i think another bill should
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
be resubmitted
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
next year or the following year to
 
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
next year or the following year to
establish

00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
establish
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
best practices for rail trails similar
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
to what they have in massachusetts which
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
is what
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
i sort of based this on okay so
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
it is my it is my my uh opinion that
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh this bill shouldn't go anywhere okay
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
sorry uh i don't know about this message
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
use this law that
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative thomas was talking about
 
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.349 align:start position:0%
representative thomas was talking about
but

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh i just want a clarification about
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
these tests would be performed on only
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
on rail trails
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
if ohrvs wanted to be on a rail trail
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct that was the original
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
intent oh i'm sorry go ahead
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative gould
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
when a bill is interim study the bill is
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
effectively dead
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
and so we would either recommend
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
no further legislation on the issue of
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
testing of rail trails for fugitive dust
 
00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:03.990 align:start position:0%
testing of rail trails for fugitive dust
or

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
other problems or not recommend
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
for future legislation on the issue the
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill could look like anything
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
if there is bill a bill introduced yes
 
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
if there is bill a bill introduced yes
okay

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
but this uh is just for rail trails now
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
that i would be voting on
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
correct yeah the bill well the bill the
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
original bill was to require
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
ohrv clubs to pay for testing
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
and we learned early on that because
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
first of all ohrv clubs are not the only
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
people using the trails the rail trails
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the state and do we would we if we
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
were going to test for toxic substances
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
would we want to test just new trails or
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
trails that are you know it just seemed
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
like there was a lot more to
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
unravel in this which is why we interim
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
studied it
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
um so probably uh it should have for the
 
00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:05.430 align:start position:0%
um so probably uh it should have for the
study

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
inside well i don't know we'll have to
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
um representative spang and then
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative wendy thomas again
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
there seems to have been a
 
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.190 align:start position:0%
there seems to have been a
misunderstanding

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
that came out of ols has an
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunate habit of making up
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
misleading titles for bills
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can be very destructive
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
um i think uh for example this one
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
it does the title says that the club
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
has to pay for it the bill says
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
that it has to be paid for by the
 
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
that it has to be paid for by the
municipality

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
person or organization seeking the
 
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.230 align:start position:0%
person or organization seeking the
conversion

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say just ohrv
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
clubs it could be a municipality
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
so if our decision is being made because
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that we should have
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't have the clubs pay for
 
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't have the clubs pay for
it

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
then it's we're doing a disservice to
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
um yes and so i just wanted to make a
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
clarification what i referred to as the
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
best practices for rail trails from
 
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.589 align:start position:0%
best practices for rail trails from
massachusetts

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
that is not a bill that is that is a
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
document that
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
is followed for rail trail management in
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts and i think that that's
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
kind of what we
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
what i was looking for in this bill and
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
that i wanted
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
um rail trails to be tested for toxic
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
substances i wanted um to make sure that
 
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.510 align:start position:0%
substances i wanted um to make sure that
if

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
rail trails are opened up to people that
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
they follow certain guidelines
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
um regarding fugitive dust and um
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh impact to local uh vegetation
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
and and that kind of i mean so
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think that that this bill has evolved
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
into something
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
that is that is more sort of more of a
 
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.750 align:start position:0%
that is that is more sort of more of a
management

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
plan for the use of rail trails in new
 
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.109 align:start position:0%
plan for the use of rail trails in new
hampshire

00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
and i see judith has a question yeah i
 
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:40.870 align:start position:0%
and i see judith has a question yeah i
still

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
still
uh

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
so what's the difference between uh
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
so you don't feel that we're ready
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
to actually enact um this
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
this requirement right you feel that it
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
is something that should be subject to
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
to study or uh
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
what's the difference be between what
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
have submitted and what you are really
 
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.750 align:start position:0%
have submitted and what you are really
after

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
so so don't get into the nitty-gritty of
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
the bill that we already decided wasn't
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
fit to pass
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
just as exactly right i just wanted to
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
know what's happening to the issue
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
well that's what we're here to discuss
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
what what her thinking was when she
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
decided that where she thinks this
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
should go
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
and why well
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's okay well representative thomas i
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
see you have your hand up so
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah just to further this discussion um
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
originally my thinking was that the ohrv
 
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.069 align:start position:0%
originally my thinking was that the ohrv
club

00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
club
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be required to pay for this
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
because they're doing the most damage
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
but i don't it was brought to my
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
attention that
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
other other um communities use the rail
 
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.270 align:start position:0%
other other um communities use the rail
trails

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
trails
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that it's it's it could be perceived
 
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:19.750 align:start position:0%
and that it's it's it could be perceived
as

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
unfair that they that they have to pay
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm all for you know in some kind of
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
a committee or commission
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
making them pay for partial payment on
 
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
making them pay for partial payment on
this

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
because i do think that they they put in
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary load on these rail
 
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.270 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary load on these rail
trails

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
trails
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
but but if i'm talking about all rail
 
00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:42.630 align:start position:0%
but but if i'm talking about all rail
trails

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
trails
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
um then it's then it's not fair to sort
 
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
um then it's then it's not fair to sort
of

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
put the burden on one club
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
so that's where i think some sort of a
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
rail trail committee or commission
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
is is going to be needed to to establish
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
best practices
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
around new hampshire and and maybe
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
they'll decide that you know up north
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of usage of the rail
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
trails maybe
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
maybe ohrvs you know should be required
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
some of the cost
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think one of the things as well
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
is that we want to take a look at what
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is doing as far as
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
protection of the trails
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
as well i think that's something that
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has mentioned a
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
couple of times
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
um this is certainly something that's
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
important the
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
ohrvs probably do the most as far as
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
disrupting these beds and causing the
 
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.550 align:start position:0%
disrupting these beds and causing the
the

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
dust which has uh quite a bit of
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
hazardous material as we found out in
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
one of our hearings
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
in it um but let's take a look at what
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
some of the other states are doing
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
before we rush into this and i think
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's why this probably needs a little
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
more work
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
at least it needs some investigation of
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
what's been created out there to
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
protect and develop these trails in
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
other states and then maybe we can bring
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
another bill back in at a later date
 
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.790 align:start position:0%
another bill back in at a later date
okay

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
i see no other hands raised does anyone
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
else have anything to
 
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:16.090 align:start position:0%
add to this anyone who hasn't spoken
 
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.630 align:start position:0%
add to this anyone who hasn't spoken

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
so um i i
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
this morning i was reading the interim
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
study report that was published in the
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
calendar when we voted to interim study
 
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.589 align:start position:0%
calendar when we voted to interim study
this

00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
rather than just saying this does not
 
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:37.990 align:start position:0%
rather than just saying this does not
need

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
future legislation i came up with
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
something to the
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
re recommending future legislation to
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
form a study committee to us
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
to learn which tests would be need to be
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
conducted to determine the extent of the
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
presence of hazardous materials what
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of remediation would be expected
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of such remediation
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
additionally the committee with advice
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
from experts could determine best
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
management practices for opening new
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
rail trails for recreational use
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
so that kind of takes out the who's
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
paying for it and it just
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
puts it into a study committee that's
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
kind of what i came up with
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um i'll definitely take some comments i
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
see representative renzola with his
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh i like that
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
i mean uh it takes the
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're if if there's there's
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a it's an issue
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
but it's a complicated issue and
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
rather than spend all of the time
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh once the if when a bill comes forward
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
to spend all of this time
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
of going through all of the
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
ramifications and all of the nuances
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
of this issue if you put it into a study
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
and who has have people spend the time
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
to actually work out all of the all of
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
the problems and all of the issues
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
and then come back with a recommendation
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i especially if if this covet
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
thing goes into
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
into january we're not going to be able
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
to do much on
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
on any on anything in the way of
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
extended work sessions or things like
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
that so i think
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing is probably a
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea unless
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'm missing something okay
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
so if there's nothing else to say
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
then i'll nothing else to say i'll close
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay we've closed the work session on
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1426.
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
now we're going into uncharted territory
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
um i'll open the executive session
 
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.790 align:start position:0%
um i'll open the executive session
on

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:30.580 align:start position:0%
house bill 1316
 
00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.829 align:start position:0%
house bill 1316
[Music]

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the ohrv trails known as
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking for a motion and
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative rum has her hand raised
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
yes i move that we not recommend
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
a second second i didn't see who
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
seconded that
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
can you raise your hand whoever made the
 
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.190 align:start position:0%
can you raise your hand whoever made the
second

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative bushway makes the second
 
00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:17.670 align:start position:0%
representative bushway makes the second
okay

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
and now representative when i'm now
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking for discussion
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
yes and um i actually also agree that we
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
should not
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
go forward with this um and there are a
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
few reasons one
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
is that towns right now are taking
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
action because of covid
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
um you you might have read that they've
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
they've banned um
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
some ohrv traffic on roads because of
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh young drivers um they're currently
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
up north in the middle of lawsuits about
 
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.390 align:start position:0%
up north in the middle of lawsuits about
this

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
um and because of the the covet epidemic
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
um or pandemic i should call it um
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's been limited
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
use uh throughout the summer so
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't necessarily think it's a bad
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
idea however i think we need to wait
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
until the dust settles to see what comes
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
out of all of these actions
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
before we um even think about proposing
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
any kind of solutions
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative renzullo
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh i did not hear anything in the motion
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
to around mentioning the hoyt road
 
00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:42.150 align:start position:0%
to around mentioning the hoyt road
issue

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
if that's if if it's not in a motion in
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
some manner
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that issue be uh
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the in what is written about this in
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
report then i cannot spoil the motion
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay um i don't believe
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
that we can actually address it in the
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
motion because
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment was not adopted and is not
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
part of the bill
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like uh it was no motion was
 
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.190 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like uh it was no motion was
made

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
to ought to pass as amendment as amended
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is not part of it i think we
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
need to make a
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
so-called gentleman's or general
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
person's agreement that we're going to
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
include that and that
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
that needs to be i believe that
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that needs to be included in in my mind
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
it needs to be included in the report
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it can be
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
in the motion and joel uh perhaps you
 
00:53:50.079 --> 00:53:50.710 align:start position:0%
in the motion and joel uh perhaps you
can

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
clarify for us what the what the rules
 
00:53:54.839 --> 00:53:56.630 align:start position:0%
clarify for us what the what the rules
are

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
right i mean i guess the formal motion
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
is the the simple one
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended for
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and um so i i think along with that
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
though can
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
go in understanding um by the
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
by the person who made the motion and
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
and through discussion that that will be
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
um included in the report
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so i think that would be part of the
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
you could have that discussion right now
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
um and and people could say yes i would
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
like to have i think that should
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
definitely be um in the the actual
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
um paragraph or whatever that's written
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
up uh addressing the hoyt
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
road um situation so in terms of whether
 
00:54:39.599 --> 00:54:39.910 align:start position:0%
road um situation so in terms of whether
it's

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
part of the formal motion that's a fine
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
point i think
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
um um but i think uh resident run could
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
express that she feels that that should
 
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:50.630 align:start position:0%
express that she feels that that should
be

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative ensulo did you want
 
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.270 align:start position:0%
okay representative ensulo did you want
to

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
did you have any further questions on
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that i mean
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the record i would like to have
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
someone say
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
and part of that motion is that that
 
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.549 align:start position:0%
and part of that motion is that that
beings

00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
beings
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
that there be inclusion that the hoyt
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
road issue
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh is not uh
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
this that this recommendation does not
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
pray is not the prejudice the white road
 
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.710 align:start position:0%
pray is not the prejudice the white road
issue

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
or does not have the uh
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
does not affect the hoyt road issue it
 
00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:32.230 align:start position:0%
does not affect the hoyt road issue it
anyway

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
as there are still there are still
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
issues to be
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be discussed and to be terror
 
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.750 align:start position:0%
to be discussed and to be terror
clarified

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
and cared and care of relative to the
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
hoyt road issue
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i believe that we did a
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
i asked everybody on the committee
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
during the work session
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
if they supported that you know that
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
that we would include the white
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
road marsh the interim study report
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
remember what was in the work session is
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
in the work session
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
oh no no i know that this is another
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
meeting yeah oh i know it is
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative rome
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh representative cohen and
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
then representative thomas
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
um represent ron zulo there are there
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
are two things we can do right now
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
one is a motion not to recommend for
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
future legislation and or
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislation
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
those are the only two things we can do
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
however the committee report which i
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
drafted as a result of our work session
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
let me read that to you and see if that
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
captures your concerns
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative smith provided an
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
overview of the state
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
process for opening trails members of
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
the committee shared their views
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
the point that hoyt hoyt road pond
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
motorcycle racing was not vetted through
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
the committee process with public
 
00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.470 align:start position:0%
the committee process with public
hearing

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
rather through hb2 was shared as a
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
serious concern
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
the bill requires further study on the
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
issues raised
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
the committee expressed agreement that
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
this bill should not move forward but
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
raised should be studied further does
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
that capture
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
your concerns i'll agree with that
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay maybe youtube maybe you too can
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
can final you know i mean definitely
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
i would share say you know
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
the inputs so we make sure we get it
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
right okay okay
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
so that both sides of the aisle agree
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay andy i'll
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'll type this up i'll send it to you
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative smith and to you
 
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.190 align:start position:0%
representative smith and to you
representative

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
renzolo um you know once we finalize
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
that this will go to
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk on the 16th okay
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh representative cohen
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
yes so i understand i think i agree with
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i think with representative renzullo
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
but as far as the vote we're doing right
 
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.589 align:start position:0%
but as far as the vote we're doing right
now

00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
so if we vote i want to put the um
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
mass stream issue as no
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
so if we vote the way it is that happens
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
right if it doesn't address
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
even though i'm against hoyt pawn
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't address it is that correct
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
we are addressing no further action on
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
nash stream which is what the bill is
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to make a comment
 
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.829 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to make a comment
on

00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment which we had a public
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on but did not
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
add to the bill will that comment
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
be in the committee report oh yeah yeah
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
your report on the bill that we're
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
voting on
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
which both pardon
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
will that with what you just said be on
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
report on the workshop or the committee
 
00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:56.390 align:start position:0%
report on the workshop or the committee
report

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
on the vote we're about to take there is
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
no committee report on the work session
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
it would be the final report from the
 
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.390 align:start position:0%
it would be the final report from the
committee

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's fine i understand it's kind of
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
like the committee agrees
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
that nash stream should not be open to
 
00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:11.829 align:start position:0%
that nash stream should not be open to
further

00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
ohrv use but this amendment which was
 
00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:15.349 align:start position:0%
ohrv use but this amendment which was
introduced

00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
we feel like we needed to do more work
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
on it but we couldn't
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and when we interim study the bill
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know it effectively killed the whole
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment for the season
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
but more work is required on it but it's
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
not part of the bill
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's just it's convoluted but
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out a way to write it so
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
that the point gets across
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
so when someone goes to introduce
 
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.390 align:start position:0%
so when someone goes to introduce
legislation

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
in november about hoy road marsh they
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
will be able to look at this and say
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay the committee was going to do
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
more work on this
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
okay i understand i can support the uh
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
motion hoover makes it to not take any
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
action you know
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
this bill dies and i can support the
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee write-up that you're proposing
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
will happen around us i'll be fine with
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative i did want
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
we did have a public hearing on the
 
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.829 align:start position:0%

if the clerk is ready we have house bill
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
1426 related to
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
requiring off-highway recreational
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle clubs to have certain tests
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
performed on a rail trail
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
i move that we not recommend
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill hb 1426 for further
 
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.190 align:start position:0%
this bill hb 1426 for further
legislation

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
i think the discussion we had in work
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
session captures the issues around this
 
01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:38.309 align:start position:0%
session captures the issues around this
bill

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
i believe were we not look i'm sorry
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative mays i said were we not
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
looking to possibly recommend
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
the the issued to study commission
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
to create a study commission to take a
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
further look at this yes we were
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
which would mean we would want to uh
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
have this be recommended for future
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
legislation then that legislation would
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
um so wrong
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay um my question
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
is is the two motions that we have
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
when it says future legislation is that
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
specific to the language of
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
um hb 1426 or is it just
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
concepts that come up during the
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
discussion of that bill
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
1426 is dead it will not be regenerated
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
in its present form well it could be
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
someone could introduce is
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
exactly the same but i think we're
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
voting on the issue
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
we the the motion would be the issue
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
needs more study
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
i mean the issue recommending future
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
legislation could be recommending a
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
it could be recommending you know who
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
pays for it differently
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
it could be you know a study you know
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation could be a
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
number of things
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay um but not recommending to me
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
says this issue is not worth looking at
 
01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.109 align:start position:0%
says this issue is not worth looking at
again

01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay um i do support
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
um anyone that comes forward in the next
 
01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:26.069 align:start position:0%
um anyone that comes forward in the next
term

01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
with a bill to form a study commission
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%

uh so i i i support this uh
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's certainly needed and and we'll go
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
um would anyone
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
i mean basically this is the executive
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
session so we really need to clarify
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
what we are voting on and what we want
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.839 --> 01:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
renzullo

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
renzullo
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
um let me make certain i can hear you
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay again we need to have
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
as part of we need to have in in the i
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's in the motion
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
or as part of this discussion
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
an agreement that what we're really
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
is for a study commission or study
 
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.669 align:start position:0%
is for a study commission or study
committee

01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
and not go beyond beyond that we know
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there's an issue
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
we're here but we need we we
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
don't we think it has to be studied
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
outside of the committee process
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay any other uh
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative harb and then
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i agree with uh
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative renzullo i thought it
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate and i'd have to ask
 
01:09:32.719 --> 01:09:33.990 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate and i'd have to ask
joel

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
joel
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
if at the end of the motion we tack on
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
a study commission or committee
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
instead of leaving it just general new
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislation i don't know if we can
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
add that at the end of the motion so
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's pretty specific
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
to whit t-o-w-i-t colon
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
a study commission or committee
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'd recommend that we add that if if
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's possible to do
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i mean basically we are
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
making this motion
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then we are putting in a committee
 
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
and then we are putting in a committee
report

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
and the committee report would explain
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
hope to achieve with our motion
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
um joel correct me if i'm wrong i mean i
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't think we can add anything else to
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
the motion itself
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
um just like before when i spoke to this
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
fine point i mean i think the formal
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
motion is
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended for
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
future legislation i think
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
through um discussion as we did before
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
on the prior bill we
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
became very clear to the um the
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee members um and
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
what the agreement was in terms of what
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
that report will include
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh and in this case it would be in terms
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
of a study
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee um so um it's in in terms of
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you can kind of add that as a kind of
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
a parenthetical
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
to the motion i mean i imagine you could
 
01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
to the motion i mean i imagine you could
um

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
but um it just uh depends on how the the
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
chair wants to proceed well if we can
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
add it to the motion
 
01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
add it to the motion
um

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me i would just say it
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
was just it would
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
it could just be a just a it wouldn't be
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
the actual report
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
i would say it would just be maybe if it
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
would make
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
members feel better about it it could
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
just be a short little sentence added to
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
it that
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
it shall the the um uh the
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation for future legislation
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
is for the purposes of creating a study
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative brown yeah my
 
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
representative brown yeah my
understanding

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
from discussions with the house clerk
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
um the the two motions that are possible
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
for us to recommend or not recommend are
 
01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.149 align:start position:0%
for us to recommend or not recommend are
pretty

01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
um that that's going to be pretty firm i
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
think any recommendations
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
we make that are specific to a study
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee commission
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
only can be included in the committee
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
report the executive committee report
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
so i i would not advise to alter
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
the standard wording for the motions
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
that we have available to us
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i would agree in terms of the form
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's filled out there's only
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
emotions and so the you know the in when
 
01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
emotions and so the you know the in when
it

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
shows up as published in the house
 
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
shows up as published in the house
calendar

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's it's going to say that the
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
committee recommends or not recommends
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then after that will be the the um
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
the report
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
right and so that's where it would be
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
i am latia i see representative thomas
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
has her hands up and representative harb
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
has his hand up also
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay um in this recommendation for a
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
study committee or commission
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
can we drill down a little bit and say
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it is to establish best
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
practices for rail trail management in
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
that would be in the report okay all
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
right i'm happy with that thank you
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative harm yes i would uh
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
go along with supporting the motion as
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
long as
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
it was agreed that in the report we
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
would mention
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
the interim study and then the what uh
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative thomas just mentioned
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay so what i had written actually a
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
lot of it is cribbed from the
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
original interim study is recommend for
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
future you know legislation
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
to form a legislative study committee be
 
01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.709 align:start position:0%
to form a legislative study committee be
a

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
a legislative study committee be
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
established to learn
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
which tests would be needed to which
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
need to be conducted to determine the
 
01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.750 align:start position:0%
need to be conducted to determine the
extent

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
of presence of hazardous materials
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
what kinds of remediation would be
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
expected and the cost of such
 
01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
expected and the cost of such
remediation

01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
additionally this committee with advice
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
from experts could determine best
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
practice management practices
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
for opening new rail trails for
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
and that can be tweaked too if that
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover everything
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
but that would be my initial interim
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
study report
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
comments thank you for doing that report
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative actually i'm reading just
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
check that off

and also to you chairman vice chairman
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
mays for
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
your support i think sometimes the vice
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
chair is often the unsung hero
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
but i know it was scheduling you guys
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
faced a lot of challenges so thank you
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
i've been accused of a lot of things but
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
never an unsung hero
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%

and just to reiterate that this
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee has always been
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
policy over politics and i think that's
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
why we've been very successful
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
and we have the relationship we do with
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee so thank
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
