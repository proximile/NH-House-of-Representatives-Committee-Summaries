Senator Susi we haven't seen you yet but
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen a little of your cohorts a
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
already

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.629 align:start position:0%
already
and

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay so this one yeah so I know Concur
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
and request Comm conference because
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
here there was money involved right
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we didn't cons I I
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
remember there was um it put the China
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
Bild into it which Bill we doing now oh
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
do you really you want to hear why we
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the China bill or
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
did you get enough of it when at the
 
00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:11.149 align:start position:0%
did you get enough of it when at the
public

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
hearing okay so repres representa spear
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
you really want me to go into this uh
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're batting a thousand
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
going my background is electronic
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
warfare I've worked in electronic
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
warfare for 15
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
anything in the case of one of the
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
problems when the title of the bill
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
which is started me right off if you
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
wanted if you wanted to say 10 miles
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
around a military base I thought it was
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
cute wasn't going to do anything but if
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
you wanted it you could have it except
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
that the federal government came out
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
with a regulation that said if you're
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
within a 100 miles of a military base
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
and if you are from a Chinese company
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
from the mainland China then you have to
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
ask for permission and then if they
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the permission you could
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you got the permission then they
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
should be allowed but our bill would say
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
no you still couldn't be allowed so now
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're into a lawsuit
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
situation that was one thing but if you
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
wanted military uh bases we have two uh
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
we have the a National Guard and we have
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
the Communication Center over in uh
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
where was the Communication Center the
 
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
Satellite Communication in New
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
Boston problem with that is 10 miles
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
won't stop any interference with any
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
transmission along that line along along
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
the satellite line you'd have to be at
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
least 100 miles away to be able to stop
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
that companies that work in these kind
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
of Industries are required to protect
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
themselves and they do you if you
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
remember when ba systems put their
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
facade on the
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
front they uh that was a security
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
measure to stop uh to sto uh rece being
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
able to receive by planting a truck out
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot uh Doppler
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
information off the windows okay so
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
electronic warfare isn't going to really
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
get affected by this bill it's not going
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
to stop anything because you can drive a
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
truck right up to next to something and
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
take whatever you
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
want what I'm afraid well we have s s
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
senta I guess that's the name of the
 
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.870 align:start position:0%
senta I guess that's the name of the
company

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
in uh and
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hill that is the agricultural companies
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
told us agricultural said please don't
 
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
do anything to stop them they rely on
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
them then we have the logging industry
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
came in and said the Chinese people are
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
one of their biggest customers mainland
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
China is one of their biggest customers
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
and that this bill would stop them from
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
being able to lease property for where
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
they put their logs before they shipped
 
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.389 align:start position:0%
they put their logs before they shipped
them

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
overseas then we heard from at least I
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
did there are Chinese students here if
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
they live within 10 miles if they rented
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
an apartment within 10 miles of a
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
McDonald's or an overhead power line an
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
overhead power line they would not be
 
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to do
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you say in here that in the bill
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
that they can't rent property for any
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
reason at all whether it's a nonprofit
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's anything and I'm afraid
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
that based on the fact that as a result
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
of the Gaza Israel Gaza
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
War incidences anti- anti-semitic
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
attacks have gone up 140% in this state
 
00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.269 align:start position:0%
attacks have gone up 140% in this state
alone

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
as a result of covid Asian people of all
 
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
different countries have been attacked
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
all over the country we have hate groups
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
in this state uh we have the uh I don't
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
even want to list them because I don't
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
want to give them that much credit that
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
are going after people this is putting a
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
Target on the back of as every
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
Asian-American that lives in this state
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
that says this state is taking exception
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
to you for reasons we have never been we
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
have never had a problem never had a
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
problem and we've worked well with these
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
people over the years and now you want
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
to ban everything and if it was just a
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
military basis that'd be one thing but
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's everything every single industry
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
power line restaurant
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything I I think you went a little
 
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.230 align:start position:0%
everything I I think you went a little
too

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
far well I will say first of all this
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with hate groups has
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the uh Gaza or Israel
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
and I did talk to the AG's office office
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
the AG's office is actually the one that
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
helped me write this because he was on
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
the AG um did an AMX brief on the
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
Florida bill which is very similar to
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
this this does not include leases and I
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
did forward you an email from yes I did
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
I forwarded the whole committee an email
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
from the AG's office saying this does
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
not include leases it does not include
 
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
personal individuals purchasing property
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
CCP so when you have one of our biggest
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
land in this
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
state to
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
me if you're not looking at the security
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
aspects of how many um Chinese Nationals
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
have been coming over the
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
border which is uh possible terrorism
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
then I don't know how to explain um your
 
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.389 align:start position:0%
then I don't know how to explain um your
rationale

00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
frankly we have we
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
have Congress has actually started
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
putting together
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislation against the CCP and
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing lands so why should we wait
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
until Congress decides to act and start
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
doing something on our own and protect
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves I I just like to interject for
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
the Public's benefit that the original
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
Bill uh wasn't about the CCP it was
 
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
Bill uh wasn't about the CCP it was
about

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh Brewing right and uh so there's
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's actually three bills that we
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
discussing all as a packet right so one
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
and there's also uh
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
influenza no that umle not in the yeah
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's in the title it's not in the bill
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
it's not in the bill okay so Brewing was
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
scratched out on one of my piece of
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
paper I'd just like to off offer that my
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
wife is from Hong Kong she's Chinese
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
Heritage and I share the concern that
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
this might uh you know put a negative
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
light on American citizens who happen to
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
be of Chinese descent I I also
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this is potentially a
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
real issue uh and uh I think Congress
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
would need to act um at a federal level
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
to really solve this problem so those
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
are my thoughts if we wait for Congress
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
to do this we could be waiting a while
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
they have they've had it the past couple
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
of years they've just introduced a new
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
bill it's
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan just like the letter from
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen to Meritt Garland asking
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
them to look into the CCP owned
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
properties up in Maine who are marketing
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
Black Market marijuana
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to limit the bill
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
to military bases but I I don't know how
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to work or to land being
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
used for marijuana I wouldn't have any
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
problems but you're limiting it to
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
everything you're
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
right um if if I could just it's not my
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee it's his okay can I yes oh
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
thank you um the Florida law there
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
already is already being challenged on
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
the basis that um it's discriminatory
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
and it may be a violation of the federal
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
government Supremacy in um deciding
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
foreign uh Affairs and they've done an
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
amicus brief the the New Hampshire
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general has done an amicus
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
brief in favor of it and we have other
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
we have numerous other states nor North
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
Dakota has put put a ban in um don't
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
they have like nuclear nuclear weapons
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
in parked in North Dakota it's within 10
 
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.509 align:start position:0%
in parked in North Dakota it's within 10
miles

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
miles
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
but that's nuclear weapons we don't have
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
anything like actually that's not
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear weapons the one in North Dakota
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
is the major Communication Center for um
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
but you're telling me there's no icbms
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
in North Dakota I have no idea yeah they
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
do but the the base that they're talking
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
about excuse me but the base that
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking about is one of the
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
major Communications for the Air
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
Force historically this committee
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
Commerce has Whenever there is a open
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
court case or or something in question
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
we we generally wait until that has been
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
settled before we pass legislation so we
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
would say to you is that let the the
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
Florida case play itself out and let's
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
see what happens um as far as I know
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
that the People's Republic of China has
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
not purchased anything in New Hampshire
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
as yet actually that's not necessarily
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
true oh really what they bu when I was
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
talking to the AG's office they actually
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
had a school that they were looking to
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
try and purchase Oh the airplane School
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
the uh what's the what's the school it
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
was a flight school that no well it was
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
a school that they were going to use to
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
teach the um Chinese children and it was
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
going to so that they could say they
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
were taught they no they were taught in
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when actually they were
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
doing Zoom calls so that that was
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
actually turned down but they did try
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
and purchase it they did try so but it
 
00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.270 align:start position:0%
and purchase it they did try so but it
didn't

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
didn't
happen

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes so uh it's my understanding that uh
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
the company Volvo is owned by I think
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's Gile is the Chinese parent of Volvo
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
so does that are we would we be banning
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
Volvo dealerships from the state and and
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
second question the bill is very
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
complicated it has lots of uh items that
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
are pointed out why not just make it a
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
blanket ban from for the whole state and
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
just keep it simple if that's your
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
intention so those two questions please
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
that was written by the AG's office and
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
I trust what he what they put
 
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.870 align:start position:0%
I trust what he what they put
together

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
about you have to understand what I said
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the committee is when if it's a
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
majority owned by the
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
CCP that that entity is actually owned
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
by the CCP and they are required by
 
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.789 align:start position:0%
by the CCP and they are required by
their

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
law to do whatever the CCP requires of
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
them so I don't know how much ownership
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
they have in it if it's more than
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
51% that's considered a CCP organization
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they are required by China law to
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
follow everything that China wants
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
so yep keep going um so the the the last
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
line says any person who fails to comply
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
with this section shall be guilty of a
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor are we potentially making
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
our constituents criminals if they sell
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
their house or their building to a CCP
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
owned company wouldn't they be
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for the misdem metor
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
violation well I'm not sure any of our
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
residents would want to sell to The
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
Entity of CCP but this does not include
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
according to the AG's office if Joe Blow
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
on Main Street Street and Hamstead
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell their house as we had
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
brought up in the um in the committee if
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to set let's say it was a um
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
parent Chinese parent who had a child
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to exit Philips exitor and they
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to purchase there's no ban on
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to there would be
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
no problem with unless that the parents
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
are employed by the
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
CCP it's an individual purchase how do
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
you separate individual purposes if you
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
just said that it's obligated of every
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
Chinese citizen to be uh uh controlled
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
by the CCP it says any company or
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
development owned or controlled by a
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
company that is owned in whole or in
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
part by or is a subsidy subsidiary of a
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
company owned by the People's Republic
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
of China they are not owned by um the
 
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.870 align:start position:0%
of China they are not owned by um the
sub

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
sub
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
CCP the sentence further goes on to say
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
or whose principal place of business is
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
located within the people's uh Republic
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
of China may not have anything to do
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
with the CCP it may be just whatever but
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
what it says is the Communist Party
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
whatever or principal place of business
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
is located within the People's Republic
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
of China shall not own lease possess or
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
exercise and again if you look at the
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
very first part of that it says any
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
company or development owns by the CCP
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
or whose principal place of business is
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
located I don't see a comma or an
 
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
exclamation a person who purchase a home
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
their business we don't know where their
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
business is could be anywhere exactly so
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
if a p if an individual themselves wants
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
to purchase a home there's no the AG has
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
no says there's no stopping them from
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
doing that I I have a comment on that if
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
I could if you look at what's gone on in
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
Florida and this points back to what
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon was saying the
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of this is that
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
people and there was example of this in
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
the New York Times a young woman uh from
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
China her parents uh were helping her to
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
buy a condo she was turned down because
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
of the fear from the Realtors and and
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
people selling that they could be in
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
trouble from the bill so I think that's
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
an unintended uh consequence that came
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
up a lot in our hearing from from uh we
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
heard from somebody on our group who who
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
was a realy firm um very concerned about
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
that and again the AG said there there
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
should be no concern about that well
 
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's happening in Florida that's that's
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
this current AG never know the next AG
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
could we like stop up to the original
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill and just talk about the
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
merits of passing that uh on its own yes
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're in support of the underlying Bill
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
great if we don't have an agreement on
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
China Bill's dead okay that's that
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
Bill's dead and and here's the reason
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
here's suggest is that since you're the
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
ones that are raising all the concerns
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the language that Senator bzel had
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office right
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
correct that you identify those concerns
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
work with the Attorney General's office
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
and get back to us if the answer is no
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
then the answer is no okay so here
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
here's where I'm at with this and that
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
is we already had a house
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
bill that was the same subject
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
matter and the Commerce
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
bill here comes this Bill
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
unanimously kill the bill as the
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
chairman I can only say is it would be
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly irresponsible for me to
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly come come up with something to
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
make it work when my committee has said
 
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
make it work when my committee has said
un

00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
un
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
unequivocally that we don't want to pass
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
legislation because ofous
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
arguments oh exactly
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's all a species argument you know why
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
I don't like this bill because it's
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
totally xenophobic to me okay and I
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
always thought Zen it was only China
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
then I realized said no the word was
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for anything foreign okay
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
I learned that in college but no I the
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
idea that we are going to pick out one
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
country and say I mean frankly I'm more
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
worried about Russians than I am about
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
Chinese but I understand that today
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
today it's China but
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't want to say to any New
 
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.549 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't want to say to any New
Hampshire

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
citizen that you can't go into some deal
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
you can't do it you got to spend extra
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
money you got to do something to try to
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
find out whether the sale is legitimate
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
whether this is no it's it's just insane
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's ridiculous I personal opinion I
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
am ridiculous and I think this bill I
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
think this bill is ridiculous is that on
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
the mic is that on YouTube yes I I think
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of of this kind of legislation
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous and there's way not
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
interested in protecting our our
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
residents I believe our residents are
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
are very capable of protecting
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and they will not sell to the
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
People's Republic of China period I
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
remember that when po okay well right
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
hold me to
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
it hold me to it but I just don't I
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
think yes I think the bill is ridiculous
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
I thought I thought it was ridiculous on
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
the house side and fortunately my
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee agreed that they they all unan
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
to the people in North Dakota who are
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
now living next to that facility no that
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
facility was Ked out the facility was
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
kicked out it was by the federal
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
government and our law would have been
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
in conflict with that because they said
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
they can't be within a 100 miles of it
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
and you're saying only 10
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
miles so the fact is already we're we're
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
in a conflict no they weren't kicked out
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
they couldn't sell the property the
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
Chinese could not they realized that
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to be able to um uh
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
work it so they tried to sell it well
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
yeah because it couldn't be
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
there is South Carolina is it the one
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
isn't that South Carolina where they
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
sold something to China that was a big
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
issue did dakot I don't know no no it
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
was South Carolina didn't they that big
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
development there this is what they used
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
against Nikki Haley that that she was
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay about some sale so was that c was
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
CCC ownership I don't know so n would if
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
they had that law would that deal nut
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
gun through when they thought it was
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
state I'm sure they don't feel that way
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
now that the uh balloon went over their
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
territory this law is not going to stop
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
the balloons you know
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
that I like the balloons that are going
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
North Korea sending over South Korea so
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
at any rate yes I I it would be very
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but I can already see the
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
headline today is that uh the the Senate
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
kills a perfectly good important liquor
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill that's housekeeping he got a lots
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
of good stuff in it let alone dealing
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
with with uh hooka bars and killed it
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
because you you were going to fall on
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
your swords over this Chinese bill that
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
I do think is ridiculous and I hope they
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
put it in the newspaper I thought it was
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
ridiculous if you want to fight the
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
narratives we'll win hands down every
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
day on
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
restricting the Communist Party of China
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
in owning real estate in New Hampshire
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
good luck with that okay if if the bill
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
just did that in a very narrow sense
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
exactly the words you said it would be
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
okay that's not what this does and I
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
just told you if you have concerns with
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
the bill then come back to us with
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
amendments that might fix those concerns
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
the problem I have is how do I prove
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
that it was a
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
cccp entity how do I know that I mean
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that you if you're going
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
to you know right now H these Hollywood
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
start when they buy property they have
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
they have a front that does it they
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
don't you don't even know who the real
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
owner is how are we ever going to know
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
whether the CCC unless they actually
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
came out and said so if you want the
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
limit the bill that says is that the
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
cccp owns is asking to buy a piece of
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
land in the state of New Hampshire if
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
that if you want to narrow it down to is
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
government would they actually be stupid
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
so if you asking that is that what you
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
want the amendment sh I'll strip it all
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
out I don't want all that crap all I'll
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
just simply say is the cccp is not
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to buy anything in New Hampshire
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
is that that work for
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
you one of the problems we have is they
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
are also one of our largest trading
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
partners it's and they're trying to
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
normalize relationships right now we're
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
stepping in the world of foreign policy
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
here that we just don't seem to have
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
any strong basis for getting involved in
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're not foreign policy experts we're
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
not any of that stuff I we're just
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
overreaching and we're putting citizens
 
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.909 align:start position:0%
overreaching and we're putting citizens
at

00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
risk so let me ask you Mr President you
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
you would if we had the bill one L
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
sentence the cccp is barred from buying
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
anything in New Hampshire we take that
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
I don't think it works but we'll at
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
least listen you basically said no I I
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
I'm saying no I'm I'm bring it up again
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
changes okay I have a I have a hard not
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
here so we have we're putting a a a a a
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
Target on the back of every Asian person
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
in this state by saying that they are a
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
target of this bill just as it has
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
worked in so many other situations I I'm
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
that so I guess
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's we would hope that you guys would
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
Reed to the to the house uh version of
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
the bill and that I hear
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
you this might not be the only one today
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
but we're not ready to to pass this
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
legislation and like I say is if we find
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
that the Florida one is upheld and
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's language that does gets upheld
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
in the courts then then I would probably
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
feel differently about it but that would
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
year right well if if we all agree but
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
we already have we have one hard no
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
here I'm a hard no too I'm a hard we're
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
three hard nuts we're three hard nuts
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
we're three hard we just not not not
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
this year someday in the future once we
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
find out that Chinese are really out to
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:26.909 align:start position:0%
 
England

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
so you want to schedule another meeting
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
to take a vote or handle this or how
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
would you want to how how would you like
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.230 align:start position:0%
 
forward

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
Entertain Entertain any positive
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you might have on
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
Section 10 and 11 of the bill absent
 
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
Section 10 and 11 of the bill absent
that

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
um and and we'd be happy to come back in
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
a couple of days absent that I don't
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
how about we set up a study committee to
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh figure out what would be the
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate language to have in our
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
statute I don't think that would satisfy
 
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.029 align:start position:0%
statute I don't think that would satisfy
the

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
committees

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
conversation I I think part of the
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
problem I'm having is I don't know what
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
the problem is we're trying to solve it
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
it sounds like well just kick them all
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
out are we worried about Espionage are
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
we worried about pot you know buying up
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
land to sell IL Black Market pot are we
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
worried about kids beating up on uh
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
American buildings which they already do
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
are we talking about students uh that
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
whose parents work for some company in
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the in China not being allowed to
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
live anywhere's near a McDonald's what
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know what what what is the what is
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
the problem specific problem that we're
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
trying to address here not some general
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
thing but a really pointed idea of what
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
is I think we are concerned about the
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
National Security
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
implications of the Communist Party of
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
China owning property within a close
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
proximity of a military base that is the
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
bottom line concern okay if you do that
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
and you broaden it out to 100 miles so
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
it don't conflict with the federal
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
government I don't think I'd have a
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
problem with it if you said just those
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
words I wouldn't have a problem with it
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
well what I'm suggesting is since you're
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
the ones that have raised the problem
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
come back with a proposal that we can
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
think about work with the Attorney
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
General's office and we'd be happy to
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
entertain it you want to write something
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
up I would write it up 100 miles within
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
a military base the problem is is that
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
two of the biggest military braces that
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
were near don't even belong in the state
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
well we have one but we don't know what
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
it is secret secret lost no the uh
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth naal Shipyard is technically
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
in Maine but it's in Maine and then and
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
hansom of course is in Massachusetts
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
Hans I was talking about the space force
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's the communications you got to be
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
far away that's that spread Spectrum
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be that vulnerable you
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
have to also understand that the
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
National Guard is not considered um
 
00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
National Guard is not considered um
military

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
military
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
base that's why we had to add the
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
National Guard in there because it's not
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
included in the military
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
base you want to throw in the National
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
Guard and it would be very interesting
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
to see if the CCP could buy land around
 
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.030 align:start position:0%
to see if the CCP could buy land around
there

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's well no you've got three or four
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
different National Guard uh facilities
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
around the country and if you're going
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
to do 100 miles around you've pretty
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
much covered the whole
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
state fine you want you want to protect
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
against military
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh organizations but it has to be the
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
same way the feds do they can't conflict
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
with FEDS they ask for permission if
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
they get the permission because the the
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
business is a gol business because
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's what somebody wants to invest
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
in something different yeah what happens
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
they want to buy a golf course and they
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
do you're G to be worried about that the
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
course okay it's too bad um I feel sorry
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
