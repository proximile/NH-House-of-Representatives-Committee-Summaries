00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
I am here today to talk to you about
 
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 218 establishing an early
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
educator professional development Grant
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
218 aims to address the retention of our
 
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.510 align:start position:0%
218 aims to address the retention of our
teachers

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
as we all know teachers are integral
 
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
part of every child's life which is why
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
we should enable our state with every
 
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
tool possible to ensure our children
 
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
have the best and brightest teaching
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
them in the classroom this bill
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
establishes an early educator
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
professional Grant this grant aims to
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
increase teacher retention increase
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
teacher support efforts and increase the
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
likelihood of success for New
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Educators by incentivizing
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
teachers to stay in this field
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is based on another
 
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the commission to
 
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
study our teacher shortage so this is
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a new idea
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
we know the first couple of years of a
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
new Educator's career are crucial to
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
Foster their drive to make teaching a
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
lifelong career too often lately we are
 
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
seeing teachers enter the field and
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
leave it a year or two later which is
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
why we need to provide school districts
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
with the resources to support and Mentor
 
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
new teachers I hope you will join me in
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
supporting 218 and help our teachers
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
find a home in New Hampshire teaching
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
where they feel supported and valued and
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
with that I will take any questions
 
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator are there
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
any questions of Senator Fenton yes
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
represent luno and then represent Myler
 
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
not represent Miler thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you senator for bringing this
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
before us today as you know
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
we've had this uh teacher shortage uh uh
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
work group uh working on this and I
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
think your bill basically speaks to a
 
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
major piece of this as it relates to
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
retention and I appreciate you bringing
 
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 align:start position:0%
this forward to us thank you very much
 
00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I um it's really about
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
teachers who went to the field and we're
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
seeing them leave a year or maybe two
 
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
years later and this will really help
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
support them in that field and hopefully
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
retain them representative luno
 
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
you very much senator for for bringing
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
this forward so um I do notice that that
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a fiscal note on this bill
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
but it says uh they were unable to
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
provide as introduced at the at the time
 
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
in your estimate what would the fiscal
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
cost be of that's a great question I
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
think there's people behind me that
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
could probably answer it a little better
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
than me okay well just as a follow-up on
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
on that so so it does talk about
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
um a grant
 
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
um uh being a half million dollar an
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
annual appropriation five hundred
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
um uh is that how does that compare with
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
with a bill that's being heard in Senate
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
education right now in terms of use of
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
State uh State dollars and the impact uh
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
it could have on families and Workforce
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I will
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
compare it to another bill
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
um however this bill really is one of
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
the main pillars to help our Educators
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
and retain them I think that's what
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
really comes I know I keep saying that
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
word retain but that's really what it
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
keeps coming back to is that
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
um we're losing teachers whether that's
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
be to a different industry or another
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
state that pays more I think when a
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
teacher feels valued in their District
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
or in their school and their support and
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
um that truly goes a long way in keeping
 
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:21.860 align:start position:0%
that individual in that school
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
I do have one question for you Senator
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
yes sir um
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
within the bill itself it's this is a
 
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
grant for five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh when I looked at the fiscal note and
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
with doe there's apparently they're
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
looking for like a 0.3 full-time
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
equivalent when I try to do some rough
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
modern mathematics came out with about
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars uh is it
 
00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:47.459 align:start position:0%
possible that that 25 Grand could come
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
out of the five hundred thousand yeah
 
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you Mr chair for the
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
question absolutely and also we're
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
talking about point three if I
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly 0.3 working you
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
know how how much uh work is that
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
individual going to do uh there's
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that dictates to higher
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
individual to run this program or
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
um 0.3 is pretty small number uh so I
 
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
think it's easy enough to
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
um maybe spread the job between two
 
00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:19.339 align:start position:0%
people maybe 0.5 and you know
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions from the
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative cascaden thank
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you on behalf of
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
teachers senator
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
questions one is what is your intent of
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
early educator are you talking about
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
preschool K and how how high up the
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
grades and my second question is on line
 
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.949 align:start position:0%
grades and my second question is on line
six

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
um whether you would consider uh
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
changing the word and to or
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
and that would make
 
00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.829 align:start position:0%
and that would make
um

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
that would provide options
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I've found that implementing mentors
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
um can be very valuable
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
so if they could Orient support or
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
Mentor Educators and what what is the
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
intent of early educator absolutely
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the questions the
 
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
intent of early is early in their career
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
not in terms of
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the age group they're teaching we're
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
talking about an individual that has
 
00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:19.459 align:start position:0%
been in the uh a teacher that's been
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
within the first three years of the
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
career in education line set okay thank

I'll leave that up to you find
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
individuals here in the house education
 
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
committee I think you all know what
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
you're doing so
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
point to that
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.430 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative dry
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
um I was looking at the comments from
 
00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:56.339 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing and uh was talking
 
00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:57.470 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing and uh was talking
about

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
um virtual mentoring for Rural Educators
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
in a program from that was that still
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if that individual is
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
here who testified on that subject um
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
the way I understood it was that the
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
state outsources a rural educator
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
program to
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
do something like Colorado that has a
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
very large fiscal note that we're doing
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
and this could somewhat take place of
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
that or maybe spend less money going out
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
of state and actually spending more
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
money locally
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
if that answer your question yeah I was
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there was a quote here
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
about maybe spending it locally and
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
wonder if they've been progress on that
 
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.130 align:start position:0%
wonder if they've been progress on that
issue

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes there'll be progress
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
any further questions of the senator
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you guys have
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
a good day
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a cool heart coming with you
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman member it's a house
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
education committee for the record my
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Tuttle I'm president for
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
Nea New Hampshire representing 17 000
 
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
Educators across the state with me I
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
have Irv Richardson who is our
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
coordinator for public education and
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
school support and so we're going to
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
testify together if that's okay
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
as you're aware Senator defense said
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
we're facing a crisis in education this
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
isn't anything new we have you know an
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
educator shortage the committee that was
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
set up did come out with some ideas and
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
I believe this was one of them
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
we do want to say though we don't really
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
think we have an educator shortage for
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
the most part
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
um we we don't have a shortage of
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
potential Educators but we do have a
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
shortage of Educators coming into the
 
00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
profession so the people are there but
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
we need to come up with ways to attract
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
them and to retain them and this can go
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
back as far as high school getting that
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
pipeline from high school into the
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
profession into the pre-service programs
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
that we have in colleges and then also
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
into you know keeping them in New
 
00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
into you know keeping them in New
Hampshire

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so I feel the line of sight
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
um so the talents out there but you know
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
not having support for this Talent is
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a hindrance to attracting
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
entertaining that Talent historically I
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
think we've said this before and I'm
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
sure you've heard if Educators or
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
teachers are going to leave the
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
profession they're going to leave within
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
the first five years this bill would
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
allow that mentoring to really help and
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
booster it so that they're not leaving
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
within the first five they feel
 
00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:20.090 align:start position:0%
within the first five they feel
supported

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you know as the professionals that
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
they are they would help require local
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
professional development master plans to
 
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:27.620 align:start position:0%
articulate professional learning goals
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
and have that mentoring Early Education
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
leaders this legislation would also
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
provide matching grants to local school
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
districts that use their local funds to
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
help fulfill these sort of plans this is
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
kind of a multi-pronged effort to
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
attract and retain those teachers I like
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
to think of it as a three-legged soul
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
and so when I was teaching and I had
 
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
open house in the classroom I would talk
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
to the parents about education really is
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
a three-legged stool right it took
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
myself as a teacher it took the students
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it took the parents to all work
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
together to make sure that education was
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
the best it could be and so
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
we were all part of that that stool this
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
is part of that the Senate has acted on
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
two legs of the stool already so we had
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 140 which is the student
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
teaching stipend that went through the
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
Senate education and we're working with
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
them still on the possibility of a loan
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
repayment program that is going to be
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
one way to help reduce barriers of
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
people coming into profession so this we
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
see is that third leg of the stool if we
 
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
can't support the teachers and the
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
Educators coming into the profession
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to fill the
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
positions that we still have open across
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
the state and there's many positions
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
still open across the state so at this
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
point I'm going to turn it over to Irv
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
Richardson like I said our coordinator
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
of public education School support he's
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
going to share some more expertise on
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the importance of supporting mentoring
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
programs for early Educators thank you
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Megan
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Ladd and honorable
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
members of the House Education committee
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Megan cedis Irv Richardson
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing Nea as the
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
coordinator of public education School
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
support I also speak from my experience
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
as a teacher and school principal
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of SB 218
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
which establishes an early educator
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
professional development Grant
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would require that as part of
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
their District professional development
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
plans districts would be required to one
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
articulate what are the professional
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
learning goals and descriptions of the
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
activities that districts will use to
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
orient support and Mentor Educators who
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
are one or more of the following and I
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
think this is important within the first
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
three years of the profession Megan
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that ingersoll's
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
research shows that people leave within
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
the first half that all Educators leave
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
within the first five years
 
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
it's also people who are in there
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
working in a new school or District so I
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
know people who've had experience
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
teaching in one District go to another
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
District they also need support although
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
it's a different kind of support
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
and then people within districts are
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
switching roles those people would also
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
get support and I'd like to point out
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill appropriately uses the
 
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:08.780 align:start position:0%
word educator New Hampshire regulation
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
50102s defines Educators as
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%

Educators educational interpreters and
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
School nurses this means that when
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
passed this bill would help to ensure
 
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
that in addition to supporting new
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
teachers which is incredibly important
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
districts would also be designing and
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
providing support to new administrators
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
Specialists para educators
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
interpreters and School nurses and I
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
know at least three former
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
administrators in the room and I know
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
when I started I felt prepared when we
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
graduated from Southern Maine but I
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
could have used some additional support
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
in those first few years
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
so this would allow districts to access
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
funds to support the professional
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
development activities in which the
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
district's new Educators would be
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
engaged and I think this is actually as
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
it should be because when it comes to
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
working with our students there are no
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
unimportant jobs and that Educators
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
assuming these roles need and deserve
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
support as they learn their new
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and refine their
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
professional skills
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
as Megan alluded to concerns about
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
educated Recruitment and Retention are
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
not new
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
long before the current shortage of
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
Educators research informed us that up
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
to half of all new teachers were leaving
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
the profession the first five years this
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
turnover costs districts as they have to
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
spend time and resources recruiting new
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
teachers and supporting new teachers it
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
also costs the students because of new
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
teachers coming in who don't know the
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
routines and don't know the school
 
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.630 align:start position:0%
routines and don't know the school
culture

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
culture
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
research has shown that strong and
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
effective support and mentoring programs
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
have the following benefits
 
00:18:56.169 --> 00:18:56.179 align:start position:0%
one it helps in recruiting new Educators
 
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
schools and districts with mentoring
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
programs are more likely to attract new
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
Educators because these Educators know
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
they will be joining an organization
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
that offers them support and
 
00:19:06.419 --> 00:19:07.610 align:start position:0%
that offers them support and
encouragement

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
encouragement
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
it advances the professional learning of
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
new Educators by working with an
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
experienced high quality Mentor in the
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
school or District new Educators
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
increase their professional skills more
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
quickly than by using trial and error in
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
isolation experienced Educators serving
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
as coaches and mentors can increase new
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
Educators learning this is particularly
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
important with some of the site-based
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
plans which people don't go through
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
preparation but they go on site and have
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
only a mentor to help them develop their
 
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.110 align:start position:0%
only a mentor to help them develop their
skills

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
skills
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
it reduces educator attrition Educators
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
who feel supported engaged in their
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
schools professional culture and who are
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
making a positive difference in their
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
students lives are more likely to stay
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
in the profession
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
this bill shows the legislators
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
intentions to support the new Educators
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
and finally it increases staff
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
collaboration and reduces isolation with
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
orientation and mentoring Educators
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
develop social capital and create a
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
sense of collective efficacy in a
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
positive School culture there's research
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
that shows that student achievement is
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
higher in schools with greater social
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
capital and educator collaboration
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
once this bill becomes law there are
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire ready to
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
support schools and districts as they
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
work to orient support and Mentor new

Haverhill on June 26th if anyone would
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
like to attend Haverhill New Hampshire
 
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.330 align:start position:0%
like to attend Haverhill New Hampshire
yes

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think Massachusetts would
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
be good with us going over the border to
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
provide training although it could
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
happen so District support for new
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
educators will be partially supported
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
through the funds of this bill
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
and was brought up earlier These funds
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
can supplement a District's use of Title
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
II funds currently the New Hampshire
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Education does contract
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
with a group in Fort Collins Colorado
 
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
for about 469 thousand dollars to
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
provide mentoring for Rural teachers and
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's great but
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
it would not that work does not provide
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
support to the other Educators that
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
would be covered with this bill
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
as president Tuttle indicated in her
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
testimony this legislation would provide
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
additional support to New Hampshire
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
Educators in a time when we are
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
experiencing shortages and a great need
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
for additional highly qualified
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
Educators I urge this committee to find
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
that SB 218 ought to pass thank you and
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much any
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative thank you Mr
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
could you review for the committee what
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
is the content of your Mentor training
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
there are several different components
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
to the mentor training the first one
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
really is looking at a way of being and
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that our goal for the new
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
Mentor isn't to create a clone of myself
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
but to support you and your learning as
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
an individual educator
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
then we get into how do we give and
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
accept feedback so we often I was taught
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
as an administrator to spend a lot of
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
time here's how you give feedback we've
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
learned that it's also important to help
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
the new educator understand how do I
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
receive accept and use feedback then we
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
get into an instructional conversation
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
so how can I sit down and help you plan
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
a better lesson how can I help you
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
reflect upon your lesson and how can we
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
work together on improving the school
 
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.730 align:start position:0%
work together on improving the school
culture

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:00.740 align:start position:0%
culture
 
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so you also mentioned the issue of
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
the five-year
 
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.370 align:start position:0%
the five-year
window

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
is is it your feeling that many leave
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
the profession because of the isolation
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
in their own classroom without the kind
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
of administrative or peer support
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the research would indicate
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
I think there are different reasons why
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
people leave but
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
Dan lordy talked about we used to work
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
in individual one-room School houses and
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
then now it was like an egg crate where
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
we put all the individual legs but we
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
really don't interact and support each
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
other as much as we could so it's not
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
every educator that's leading because of
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
isolation but it is a strong factor in
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
why some people even thank you
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry and then
 
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry and then
representative

00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there any priority
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
as to how this would be awarded among
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
that I don't know of a priority it would
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
be those when they
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
amended their professional development
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
plans to include this would include what
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
funds would match their Title II funds
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
so I know of no
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to serve this group first
 
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.649 align:start position:0%
we're going to serve this group first
okay

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:19.490 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
so there's there's no
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
um like Financial priorities or rural
 
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539 align:start position:0%
priorities or anything like that no
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as I know yes thank you
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me better exactly
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
what this money specifically is being
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
used for is it to pay the mentors extra
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
or what is it I'm not sure I understand
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
it could be one of several things it
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
could be to pay a mentor for a new
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
educator or it could be that someone
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
needs a class in classroom management or
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
they need to attend workshops so we're
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
leaving that up to the local districts
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
to determine okay we Megan is a new
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
principal or a new teacher or a new
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional what does she need for
 
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional what does she need for
support

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then we could use these funds to
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
provide her with that support if it's a
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
mentor great if it's a workshop great
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
thank you support representative Heath
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
I just have to say thank you
 
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
I just have to say thank you
um

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
many years ago when I was an assistant
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent we ran a mentoring
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
program in the sau19 and the results
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
were so
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
fabulous not only did the collegiality
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
amongst in between teachers
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
administrators and parents but the
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
children benefited completely children
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
had higher assessment scores they did
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
better in classrooms everybody was
 
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.990 align:start position:0%
better in classrooms everybody was
happier

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
happier
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
um do you anticipate those kinds of
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
findings if we have this Grant and quite
 
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.769 align:start position:0%
findings if we have this Grant and quite
frankly

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
um as a person on division two in
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
finance I look forward to working with
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
you on this so hopefully this passes
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
this body
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question coming I I do
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate those results coming out of
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
this when I first started teaching in
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
Keene years ago I I had a mentor as a
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
new teacher but then when I moved
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
districts and was teaching in Pembroke I
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
was you know 10 years into my teaching
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
profession but I had a mentor more for
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
the culture of the school and both of
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
those instances made an enormous
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
difference and how I felt as a teacher
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
and just everything you would just
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
mention so I do think those results will
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
come out of this
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and Herb what I
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
would do if Megan want to get a degree
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
in principleship or Administration
 
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:51.380 align:start position:0%
Center of Southern Maine
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
Charlie Smith yeah that's right I
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
remember thank you
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Sue Hannah and I
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
live in Derry I am an educator in the
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
Manchester school district and I am the
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
President of the Manchester Education
 
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.890 align:start position:0%
President of the Manchester Education
Association

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
I wanted to speak about this bill today
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
because I think it's extremely important
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
if I'm not one of the few then I'm
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably the only person in the state
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
who actually has a job that addresses
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
this I am not a mentor for the
 
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District we don't have
 
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.130 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District we don't have
any

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
when I first started teaching in
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester in 2005 we did have a mentor
 
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.909 align:start position:0%
Manchester in 2005 we did have a mentor
program

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
it was fantastic it helped me feel at
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
home immediately it helped me to
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
understand the evaluation process it
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
helps me to
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
know that I had someone who had my back
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
and if I had any questions about what I
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
was doing I knew that I had a person
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
that I could ask
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester lost that program in the
 
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
2011-12 school year when there was a lot
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
of financial Devastation going on there
 
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:15.649 align:start position:0%
of financial Devastation going on there
um

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
right now what I do is I work for the
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District on
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
professional development and
 
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.909 align:start position:0%
professional development and
credentialing

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
I work with the new teachers who are
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
coming in Manchester had over 100 new
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
teachers come in this year
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
about 50 of them
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
are not credentialed
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm working on with them
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
plus I'm working with another at least
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
70 people who are searching for a
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
different credential so it's a lot of
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
work and it's a lot of time having
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
mentors in the schools and in the school
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
district would be extremely important to
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
be able to help these people understand
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
the Myriad of paperwork that you need to
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
go through in order to get a credential
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
if you're not going through the
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
traditional route of college
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
um but it's also really important for
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
the district to be able to address all
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
the competencies that the Department of
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
Education is looking for in an educator
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that the district would be looking
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
for in an educator
 
00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:24.620 align:start position:0%
our school district in particular is is
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
working so hard
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
to do these things but without mentors
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
these people are not
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
able to be supported in the way that
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
they need to be and so I know we will be
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
losing some of these brand new Educators
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
who are really excited about coming in
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
and working with students
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
and improving the school district
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
but because of the the lack of mentors
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
we are not able to completely support
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
them you know there are 1100 School
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
Educators in our district there's a lot
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
that needs to go on
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so from the largest District in the
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
state it's really important to have a
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
program like this
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
even if it's one person at the
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
elementary level and one person at the
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
secondary level it's better than nothing
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
because we have someone we know we can
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
rely on to go out and help people in
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
their day-to-day and not feel like as Dr
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
Richardson said that they're in an egg
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
crate and they can't go talk to each
 
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.130 align:start position:0%
crate and they can't go talk to each
other

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
when I had a mentor when I first started
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
I knew I had someone to talk to
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I knew that
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
I had people around me who were in the
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
same boat that I was and coming in at
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
the same time and we found a lot of
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
ask that you approve this bill and
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
support it it is really really important
 
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.930 align:start position:0%
support it it is really really important
to

00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
the retention of great educators
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
you don't know what you have until
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're probably three or four years in
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
as far as a new educator and what they
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
but if they're going to leave us in
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
those first three to five years we will
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
never know what we had and what our
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
children will miss out on
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.549 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for coming
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
in I'm assuming you're on school
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
vacation yes indeed
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
the concept of mentoring
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
I've always thought of that as something
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
that comes about naturally and Affinity
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
between people you know someone who's
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
new looking up seeking out somebody with
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
greater Authority and experience so I'm
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
curious it sounds to me like you're
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
creating a position of a mentor or are
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
you talking about training current
 
00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
Educators and how to be mentors
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes
 
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.570 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes
so

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:04.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
mentoring educators
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
being able to have some positions in the
 
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:12.380 align:start position:0%
school district where we have
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
experienced Educators who can work with
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
a group so we have a large group of
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
Educators in the room today if I were
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
going to work with all of them
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
teach them about what our evaluation
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
system is like teach them about those
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
first days of school and what to do or
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
maybe what not to do I would be able to
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
teach them about
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
the the policies and so on of the
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
district so mentors can take on a few
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
different roles in a school district
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
because mentoring on the large scale
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
which is what we're talking about here
 
00:32:58.570 --> 00:32:58.580 align:start position:0%
would be helping our newer Educators
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
providing workshops for them on maybe a
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
monthly basis to say okay it's time to
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
get ready for grades here's how you do
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
report cards here's how you use your
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
student information system
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
on a smaller basis we also have mentors
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
who are working with
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
individuals on their
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
credentialing plans and that is if I'm a
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
mentor I'm an educated experienced
 
00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:28.909 align:start position:0%
mentor I'm an educated experienced
educator

00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
educator
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
I have a certification of K-8 Elementary
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
Ed so if I'm working with another
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
educator who is getting that
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
certification I can mentor them I can
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
work with them on what they're doing in
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
their classroom have them observe me I
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
go observe them we work on their
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
paperwork to get credentialed and make
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
sure they're taking the proper either
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
classes or workshops or whatever it
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
might be to get them to that point of
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
being a credentialed educator so we have
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
a number of different opportunities for
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
what Mentor can be in this case we're
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
talking more on the broad perspective of
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
being able to work with many Educators
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
at once I
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
going through an orientation process
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
before the school year starts and being
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
able to provide
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
some support and some leadership that
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
our people especially those who
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
I have never done anything with teaching
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
thank you it seems to me
 
00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:37.490 align:start position:0%
thank you it seems to me
um

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
teachers would be natural mentors
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
because there we are kind of mentoring
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
in the classroom all day long so it it
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
and am I understanding correctly that
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
sounds like we would be teaching
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
educating teachers and how to reach
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
outside of their classroom and consider
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
mentoring and teaching their colleagues
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
in order to build a better school for
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
everybody involved correct so as an
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
experienced educator
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my last last year when I
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
was actually in the classroom
 
00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:12.290 align:start position:0%
was actually in the classroom
um

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
I worked with the educator next door who
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
was new to teaching she is on an
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
alternative certification plan
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
um she's teaching math and I'm teaching
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
literacy so completely different however
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm in her classroom all the time or
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
she's coming into mind to see what I do
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
we work together we created Escape rooms
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of things for all of our
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
students together and using both the
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
math and the literacy
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
but what I was doing was mentoring her
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
making sure that she had a good
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's expected in the
 
00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:49.730 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's expected in the
classroom

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
and yes as Educators we do that but
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
for where I am I can't really go beyond
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
I didn't have someone teaching a class
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
on the other side of me or I probably
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
would have helped them too but this is a
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
bigger perspective this is uh either at
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
the the school level or at the district
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
level where they're talking about things
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the educator needs to know and
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
understand things like policies and uh
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
the the ethics and conduct policies of
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
the doe we're talking a a broader
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
perspective of what's expected for
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
writing lesson plans for creating unit
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
plans for following the the curriculum
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
as it's been adopted and so
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
understanding those kinds of things it's
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
a lot for someone coming in especially
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
who's never been an educator to have a
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
giant program like amplify or I ready or
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
something like that plopped in front of
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
them and say go to it right if we don't
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
support them in that and we can do that
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
as mentors with multiple people so I as
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
a mentor maybe for literacy can take
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
anyone and everyone k through eight who
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be teaching the amplify
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
program and be able to train them all my
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
Educators right now in Manchester are
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
trained for that
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
but next year when we get new people
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
who's going to have time to train them
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
because it's a big program and the
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
educators are like okay I have to go do
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
this and pay attention to what I'm doing
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
with my class it's really hard to be
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
able to make sure the the person
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
down the hall is doing the same thing
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
because we're not right next to each
 
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:38.300 align:start position:0%
other right so that's what it's about
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you Mr
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.930 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
um so I've written a mentoring program
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
handbook and I got a little confused
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
with something that you said so I want
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
to see if we can clarify it
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
is it the intent and I you have such a
 
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
large District to add a full-time
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
benefited position as a mentor or from
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
my experiences it
 
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
my experiences it
um

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
a stipended position for a teacher who's
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
working in the field
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
and because mentoring requires time over
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
their required day that there would be a
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
stipend for them to provide that support
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
and mentoring so I'm not sure which
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
you're talking about thanks so I I I
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's defined
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily in this bill but I think
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
it's something that
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
um depending on what happens here and
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
how it goes forward maybe districts
 
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:37.820 align:start position:0%
would be able to develop either way
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
I have been in a district where we had
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
mentors for the whole District
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
and they that was their only job they
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
went from school to school and we have
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
21 schools in Manchester so they were
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
all over the place working with all
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
these new people making sure that they
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
were being taken care of appropriately
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
we also at the time had mentors in our
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
schools so each school had its own
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
Mentor who could talk about what's going
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
on in the school right what's expected
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
in the school so I think it really
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
depends on the district as far as how
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that would work if you have a district
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
that has three schools it's going to be
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
a lot different than
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester with 21.
 
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.910 align:start position:0%
Manchester with 21.
follow-up

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
um it would seem though that with the
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
amount of money we're talking about here
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
that it really applies more to a
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
stipended position
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
than a totally new position that
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
includes benefits but just right I I and
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
again I think it's because it's titled
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
to money entitled too tied yeah and all
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
of that it really depends on the
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
district because
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
because of the district sizes they're
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
going to get a different amount of Title
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
II money so some students could use it
 
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
as per school and some schools school
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
districts can use it as per District so
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
they could talk yeah because stipending
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
21 people might be just as much as
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative Tanner
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:09.980 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh I was sitting here trying to remember
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
way back when
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
um as a as a person coming out of a you
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
know a bachelor's degree in a master's
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
degree coming into a school district as
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
a what behind the ear teacher and
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
um the things that you've been saying
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
about the mentoring and about the
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
culture and the program I think are
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
important but you know uh they don't
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
teach you and and it's kind of like
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
being a parent there's no textbook that
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
tells you how to parent and how to react
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
to kids
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
um how to how to discipline kids how to
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
realize that there are all different
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
types of kids
 
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.430 align:start position:0%
types of kids
um

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
and how to handle situations when they
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
pop up that you least expect you know
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
um even in student teaching I remember
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
that you know how how difficult it was
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
would you go back to the dorm and talk
 
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.890 align:start position:0%
would you go back to the dorm and talk
about

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
the little boy that fell in the toilet
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
or something and you know how how that
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
just was such a you know big surprise
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
and how do you deal with it all of a
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
sudden and at least student teaching you
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
had a you had a master teacher that was
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
there to help you through it right
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
when you go out on your own you don't
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you could kind
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
of talk a little bit about that side of
 
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
mentoring about how important it is to
 
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.430 align:start position:0%
mentoring about how important it is to
have

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
an experienced teacher uh to get you
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
through those rough spots the first
 
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:44.579 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that question I
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
the having an experienced educator
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
working with someone who's Brand New
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
is incredibly important because as you
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
said there's a lot of things that aren't
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be in a textbook or
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
something that you learn in a college
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
classroom and so everybody's learning it
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
even those people who didn't get a
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
degree in teaching and I think that
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's really important to understand
 
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
that's really important to understand
educators

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
educators
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
are lifelong Learners and we've we
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
always do rely on each other for a lot
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
of things
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
having an experienced educator when
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
again when I came to Manchester I
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
already had 11 years experience at
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Valley
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
so coming in I knew what I was doing for
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
teaching but I didn't know about
 
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:35.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester I didn't know about the the
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
culture of the city I did not know about
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
the culture of the building I was in
 
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
the culture of the building I was in
having

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
an experienced educator
 
00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:48.140 align:start position:0%
who knew Manchester for me who could say
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
these are the things that you need to do
 
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:53.180 align:start position:0%
or not do
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
knowing that I could call him at any
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
time and say this happened right
 
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.250 align:start position:0%
time and say this happened right
um

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
did I do the right thing
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
to be able to be coached to say
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes you did the right thing but let's
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
talk about it right how else could you
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
have what else could you have done if
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
this situation presented itself again
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
how how might you react differently
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
I I think it's very important and you
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
know the process
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
that we see in business of onboarding
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
and bringing people into work in a place
 
00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
you get trained
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
my daughter right now is a traveling
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
nurse in Washington state she has had
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
before she even got there
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
she had at least a month's worth of
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
training online
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
had a training yesterday not even in the
 
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
hospital she's going to be in and is
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
doing a couple more days of training
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
before she sees a patient
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
um we don't have those kinds of things
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
we don't even have that kind of time
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
in education so to be able to have
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who is
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
specifically trained to make sure that
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
as people are coming in and are starting
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
a school year are completing first
 
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.670 align:start position:0%
a school year are completing first
semester

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
semester
 
00:44:22.089 --> 00:44:22.099 align:start position:0%
are working on creating assessments
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
working on how can I
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
add to this curriculum how can I
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
do something exciting for my students
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
how can I differentiate my instruction
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
all of that really needs to have a
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
mentor for these Educators who are
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
coming in because they either don't know
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
enough about teaching or they don't know
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
anything about teaching and and are
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
quite often stuck with well what do I do
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
right now because I don't know how to do
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
this for Behavior or I don't know how to
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
do this for for what this is expecting
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
there are so many changes that go
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
through uh in from the doe down to the
 
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
districts and and how we're doing things
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
and how we're improving our education
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
for the Educators in particular I think
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's really important to know that
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
having someone to guide you through it
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
just like a trainer in business just
 
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
like your professor in a college
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
classroom you need to have somebody who
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
is there to be able to help you
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
especially to reflect on what you've
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
been doing just an evaluation from your
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
your principal or your administrator is
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
not enough it doesn't come sometimes in
 
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.210 align:start position:0%
not enough it doesn't come sometimes in
time

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
change how an educator would react in a
 
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.670 align:start position:0%
change how an educator would react in a
situation

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
if if the
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation is like in November right we
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't know if something happens in
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
September or October that person needs
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
to have somebody to go to to be able to
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
talk it out to reflect on it and figure
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
out how to be a better educator or that
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
what they did was great and let's move
 
00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
what they did was great and let's move
on

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
 
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from the
committee

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%

I'm going to close this hearing on 218.
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
and with that uh we are going to go into
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
caucuses and we'll be caucusing for a
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
brief time here uh we do caucus in this
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
room so folks that means everybody has
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.579 --> 00:46:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
no it's awesome I'm glad we had a
 
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:20.410 align:start position:0%
no it's awesome I'm glad we had a
problem

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
we're going to be uh coxing for about 15
 
00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:30.530 align:start position:0%
we're going to be uh coxing for about 15
minutes

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:36.650 align:start position:0%
minutes
too

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
1.3 million dollars that's it holy cow
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
so the 1.3 million dollars they would
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to completely expend their their
 
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.060 align:start position:0%
own applications
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
would have to be completely spent at
 
00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:04.930 align:start position:0%
would have to be completely spent at
first

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
so they would have to completely spend
 
00:48:08.040 --> 01:23:39.050 align:start position:0%
so they would have to completely spend
yeah

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:57.729 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:23:57.729 --> 01:23:57.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
we have several bills here on the docket
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
for today we're going to go ahead with
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
our executive session uh uh 266 as I
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned prior to uh
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that came in dealing with
 
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:17.540 align:start position:0%
improvement in our Assessment program
 
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
and it's a bill it's just totally
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
rewriting 193 e
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
two three whole nine yards it's dealing
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
with adequacy and uh we're working with
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
doe on it
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to be exact today uh
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
much more work has to be done on this
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
particular Bill we've had I don't know
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
how many work sessions which been full
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
day work sessions on this bill
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it's like 40 pages in length
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
and so with that we're going to jump
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
over 266 and not have well I'm going to
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
open it up and then we'll recess this to
 
01:24:55.729 --> 01:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
another time because there's several
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
things I want to share right now so
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up SB 266 relative
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
to the Statewide education Improvement
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
Assessment program
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
so what I have here I spent the weekend
 
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
trying to filter through some of the
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had representative
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
cascaden it was not easy
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna pass one of these out to
 
01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
I also of course talked with Caitlin
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
over at Doe and and Dr Green and there's
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
the reason why this bill is put forward
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
is that we are putting forward in Fall
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
the Essa Grant application to the
 
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
federal government and there's some
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
things within these chapters of law
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
which need to be changed tweaked in
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
order to facilitate the application
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
which will be forwarded however in doing
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
so 266 changed a whole lot the delivery
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education the criteria
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
Etc and we're not prepared to do that
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
and until we really have a understanding
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
what we're clearly doing with this
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
section of law
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm handing this out I'm not going to
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
go through it but you can see some areas
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
which are underlined
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
I only went through about page 30 of it
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
and then gave up
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
I want to hand it out to you so that you
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
can look at it as well we're going to
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
have to have another
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
work session on this one of the things
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
we can do with this bill we can retain
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
it and work on it or we can modify part
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
of it to support what we need to do with
 
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
our Federal Grant
 
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
and then deal with a new bill coming in
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have to do that in
 
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.770 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have to do that in
November

01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
see what you think we will set up in the
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
calendar another work session 4266.
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to recess this to a time to
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
be announced yes representative cascaden
 
01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
just a question my concern was the fact
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
that both the ibass and the pbas were
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
required now
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
um so I agree with you that I would want
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
more clarification on that piece because
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
at one point it was they had a choice
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
of D either one or the other yeah and
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
then when Pace was canceled now we've
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
got to do both the performance is a lot
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
of work in prepping that's right and
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
those come two components you just
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned aren't in this that's where I
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
stopped it's yeah it's complicated
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
thanks it's very complicated
 
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.390 align:start position:0%
thanks it's very complicated
yes

01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to ask for
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
clarification so are the underlined
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
Parts reflective of
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
the changes the committee was discussing
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
as we did and current law
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
say again please and current law thank
 
01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.490 align:start position:0%
say again please and current law thank
you

01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
there are a number of sections which
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
were just like all the indicators for
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
inadequate delivery of an adequate
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
education were left out
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
of 266.
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
and that that's that's a lot of
 
01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.169 align:start position:0%
and that that's that's a lot of
legislation

01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:28:13.129 --> 01:28:13.139 align:start position:0%
so that would be in the subsequent Pages
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
we got it uh side by side from Jennifer
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
4 would that that all noted
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
that information she had there is not
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
yet been placed into this
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a huge bill you know how
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
we've addressed adequacy in Prior years
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we've looked at several components
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
like the criteria the content of an
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
that took an act of Congress to get the
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
bill out of here and so changing the
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
whole adequacy law
 
01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
is huge and I right at this time I don't
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to do it
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's my my position
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
so we'll have a work session on that
 
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
we'll recess until a time to be
 
01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.209 align:start position:0%
we'll recess until a time to be
determined

01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
for today is 213 relative to education
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
institution policies on social media we
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
had a subcommittee on that and there's
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
not a clear recommendation that came out
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
so without that recommendation I'm not
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to take any action on this
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
until we can have a committee of a whole
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
and work on this bill and try to come
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
out with a recommendation that's going
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
to be something that we can
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
move or at least discuss here I'm seeing
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
some separate amendments coming out
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
right now there's a Waters Amendment
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's a McDonald Amendment there's a
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
belcher Amendment
 
01:29:42.179 --> 01:29:43.729 align:start position:0%
belcher Amendment
um

01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
and one of those amendments I saw the
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
first time this morning and I'm not
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
satisfied with that I want to see all
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
amendments coming out of the
 
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with everybody having an
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really discuss it and
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
so again I will recess this bill until a
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
time to be determined
 
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.010 align:start position:0%
time to be determined
218

01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is establishing An Early Education
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
professional development Grant which we
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier this morning
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
I am also going to recess this until
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
there's several suggestions for amending
 
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
language which I will discuss with the
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
committee one of our representative
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
cascad and you are missing change and or
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
at one point that might be a
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
consideration we want to look at
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
but without that Amendment if we put we
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
we don't have it in front of us so I
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
would like to I'm not saying this bill
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
is not worthy not at all but there may
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
be some areas which we have to look at
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting it ready for so this
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
too will be held next week because this
 
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
is an early bill
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
time to be announced so that takes us
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
down to 272 establishing a parent's Bill
 
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
of Rights and education we know how this
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
is going to end up so I've asked that
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
the emotion come forward and represent
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
cordial I'm looking for a motion from
 
01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.910 align:start position:0%
cordial I'm looking for a motion from
you

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
on SB 272 I move ought to pass
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion made by represent
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
cordiello and second by represent
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
Belcher on SB 272 establishing a parent
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
parents Bill of Rights and education
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
for Senate courtiello and we're going to
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
have one person voting for each side on
 
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
this bill as we've mentioned speaking
 
01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:40.820 align:start position:0%
speaking yes
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
one thing that was brought up at the
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
hearing I remember was um
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
a senator suggested and I I think this
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
is the case that when parents start
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
asking questions on the issues that are
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
really the primary
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
focus of this bill has been on a small
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
having to do with gender identity issues
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
when parents start asking these
 
01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
questions they already
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
probably have a feeling that the
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
suspicion that there's something to ask
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
about they're just not going to go
 
01:32:31.739 --> 01:32:32.510 align:start position:0%
about they're just not going to go
um

01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not calling out a
 
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
certain group of people I I believe
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
it is not I believe outing a particular
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
all this bill asks for is truthful
 
01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
all this bill asks for is truthful
answers

01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
answers
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
to parents questions and I believe that
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
facilitates a partnership or in an
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
earlier hearing if you are here
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
there was uh because Megan Tuttle on a
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
different Bill brought up a phrase I've
 
01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
heard before the three-legged stool
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
parents teachers students
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
I believe that this bill
 
01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
supports that idea
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
it it forms a partnership
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
based on truth what this bill
 
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
based on truth what this bill
prohibits

01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
is something that has been part of law
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
since the very beginning of us having
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
laws you shall not lie
 
01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:37.139 align:start position:0%
it also supports something else that is
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
a pillar of our society which is
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
parental rights parental authority over
 
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
one of the counter arguments that came
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
up again and again and there was as we
 
01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
all know on this committee a waterfall
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
an avalanche whatever metaphor you want
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
to use the number of emails we got on
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
this were over was overwhelming and one
 
01:33:59.930 --> 01:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the issues that was brought up was
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.129 --> 01:34:07.139 align:start position:0%
and that could happen yes but there are
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
already laws that would make an
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
withholding this information so there's
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
an exception
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
but another point I want to bring out is
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
that something that I don't think was
 
01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:24.500 align:start position:0%
maybe mentioned um
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's realize that also there can be
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
abuse by school personnel
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I could cite a number of articles I
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
read lately things that were sent in
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
those emails but I want to keep this as
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
brief as possible I may go over my usual
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
rule of talking for three minutes
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
because this is a very important bill
 
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
and very complex
 
01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
um actually it's not complex as I said
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
it is you shall not lie
 
01:34:45.719 --> 01:34:47.570 align:start position:0%
it is you shall not lie
um

01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
so we have to recognize also that school
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
Personnel abuse can be a potential issue
 
01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.050 align:start position:0%
Personnel abuse can be a potential issue
too

01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
as I said this bill upholds parental
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
Authority there has been a century I
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
won't go into detail here Supreme Court
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
precedence for over a century have
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
upheld parental rights
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
Meyer versus Nebraska peers Versus
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Society sisters Wisconsin versus Yoder I
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
could go on and on okay I have a lot
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason that the parental
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
Authority is upheld time and time again
 
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
I ran for this office
 
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
because I used to be a teacher and I
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
taught about dystopian literature
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I started to see that some of it
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
was starting to come true a bit and one
 
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
of the novels is brave new worlds that I
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
taught and it is a a novel about a
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
society in which there are no parents
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
and it is a societies that is based on
 
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
lies and I fear that not to be dramatic
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a step in that direction
 
01:35:58.139 --> 01:36:00.129 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a step in that direction
um

01:36:00.129 --> 01:36:00.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that was
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
particularly moving for me and I was the
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
clerk so I was like along with
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative dry who took over because
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of writing and I found some
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the most dramatic testimony to be
 
01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.010 align:start position:0%
of the most dramatic testimony to be
from

01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
people who used to live in communist
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
countries and in those countries
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
parental rights are not encouraged or
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
outlawed pretty much and
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
parental rights and these societies are
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
also based on withholding truth so just
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
I I know I'm I'm talking more than I
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
usually would but um this is very
 
01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.370 align:start position:0%
usually would but um this is very
important

01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
um as a teacher I used to really go to
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
the text
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
I think the uh you know it's a list of
 
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
of Rights it kind of brings all together
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
the different laws from all over our
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
statutes for parents but the ones that
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
are contentious are
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
um it's towards the end the ones you
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
know this is the part that that has been
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
very contentious
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
so parents have the right to inquire of
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
the school or School personnel
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
and to be truthfully and completely
 
01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.169 align:start position:0%
and to be truthfully and completely
informed

01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:18.179 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
about three different issues regarding
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
gender identity this phrase is repeated
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
three times so I'm going to repeat it
 
01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:25.970 align:start position:0%
three times so I'm going to repeat it
again

01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
the right to inquire not the right of
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
school officials to out students this is
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
the right of the parent to ask a
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
question the right to inquire of the
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
school or School personnel and be
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
truthfully and completely informed
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
three times that's repeated infringement
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
of the rights in this bill if you go a
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
little earlier
 
01:37:51.729 --> 01:37:51.739 align:start position:0%
there's a similar repetition
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
infringement for the purposes of this
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
chapter shall include
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
The Knowing withholding of truthful
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
information that's one phrase and then
 
01:38:04.729 --> 01:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
the next line The Knowing provision of
 
01:38:04.739 --> 01:38:06.110 align:start position:0%
the next line The Knowing provision of
misleading

01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
misleading
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
and then the the line right after that
 
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
is the denial of the existence of
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
information what do all these phrases
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
have in common
 
01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:24.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.649 --> 01:38:27.659 align:start position:0%
so I this bill
 
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and it must pass because
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
our society is based on these two these
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
pillars of Parental Authority
 
01:38:37.209 --> 01:38:37.219 align:start position:0%
and truth without them
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
not only will the three-legged stool
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
collapse but so will our society
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent Tanner
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you there's no heavily heavier
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
burden than a great potential here
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
um SB 272 we know is part of a national
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
political movement to disrupt dismantle
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
and defame teachers in our Public
 
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.229 align:start position:0%
and defame teachers in our Public
Schools

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
parents are being led into believing
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
that they are being lied to denied
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
rights and mistreated by teachers in our
 
01:39:10.739 --> 01:39:12.050 align:start position:0%
rights and mistreated by teachers in our
schools

01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
parents already have and will continue
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
and we all respect
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
their rights to direct the care and the
 
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
education of their minor children
 
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
and there's a technical advisory
 
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
document available on the New Hampshire
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Education website
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
speaking to student privacy and student
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
transparency laws
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
that outlines the roughly 20 to 30
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
rights parents currently have concerning
 
01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:42.659 align:start position:0%
privacy and school transparency
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
parents are also protected by a federal
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
FERPA laws as well as these state laws
 
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
and have many educational opportunities
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
schools and teachers accept their
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to educate students
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
to help them grow and learn
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
to keep them as safe as possible to
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
nourish self-esteem
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
to challenge all students to be better
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
than they think they can be and to
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
assist them in becoming good citizens
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
helping a student might mean providing
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
snacks or tissue to wipe a tear
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
or tending with a Band-Aid to a bumper
 
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.229 align:start position:0%
or tending with a Band-Aid to a bumper
bruise

01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
bruise
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
offering Consul consolation uh for the
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
loss of a pet or a loved one or to
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
literally put themselves in the line of
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
fire to save their students lives which
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
we see on a daily basis
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
teachers and counselors provide a
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
trusted adult to both parents and
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
students allowing them to vent
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
to grieve to celebrate successes to find
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
resources for problem solving to hear
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
words of encouragement
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
and to tell their students that they're
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
Pride proud of them
 
01:40:59.709 --> 01:40:59.719 align:start position:0%
SB 272
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
is a bill that cynically sows distrust
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
and Division and as a consequence hurts
 
01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
and Division and as a consequence hurts
children

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
especially children who are lgbtq nine
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
Bond nine binary or transgender
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
or their families
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that forces schools that
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
could be the safe place
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
for vulnerable kids into a perilous
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
place by requiring schools to notify
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
parents of their child's participation
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
in clubs activities or organizations
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
this means groups like gay straight
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
Alliance or alatine
 
01:41:43.129 --> 01:41:43.139 align:start position:0%
in which anonymity is important for
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
their participation and without that
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
those groups cannot function
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
SB 272 also requires teachers and
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
schools to report students who request
 
01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:56.699 align:start position:0%
to be known by a nickname or want to be
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
addressed by a transgender name or
 
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.290 align:start position:0%
addressed by a transgender name or
pronoun

01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
pronoun
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
at times this rush to inform will deny
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
the time for thoughtfulness and care
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
that is sometimes needed for a teen and
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
their family to approach this sensitive
 
01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:13.490 align:start position:0%
their family to approach this sensitive
issue

01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
many of us are facing challenging and
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking issues as part of our
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
daily lives
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
schools teachers and families need to
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
support each other and work together as
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
they help children navigate the
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
complexities of growing up
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
legislators should use child welfare and
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the child as the
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
focus of their efforts but SB 272 does
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
not support children and is not in the
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
best interest of children
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
rather this ultra-conservative National
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
agenda item is intended to incite fear
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
stoke the fires of division Among Us and
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
create an adversarial battle between our
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
Public Schools teachers and Families
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
this is not the New Hampshire way and we
 
01:43:02.450 --> 01:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
should not become part of an attempt to
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
marginalize vulnerable children who are
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
already struggling
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
I I oppose this bill and oppose the fact
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
that it singles out
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
um again vulnerable transgender uh lgbtq
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
