00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
glad everybody managed to find the room
 
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
after we were all
 
00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
misinformed and I'm opening the hearing
 
00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1188 and call
 
00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.990 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1188 and call
Representative

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
BR thank you chair Maguire House Bill
 
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
1188 was um is being presented to the
 
00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
committee as a means of removing some of
 
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
the barriers that lnas have when they're
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
entering the
 
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
workforce in the current statutes LNA is
 
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
included in those profession s that have
 
00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
aprns RNs and licensed practicing nurses
 
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
to have the ability to read and write
 
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
the English
 
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
language and although um these individ
 
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
these individuals who have a degree have
 
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
passed a test in English and have taken
 
00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 align:start position:0%
a have taken um the courses in English
 
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
they may not have what we will call the
 
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
ability to read and write in the English
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
language so we have taken them out of
 
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.190 align:start position:0%
language so we have taken them out of
this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
requirement and in section
 
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
two it uh does require them
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
to uh have a license and to have enough
 
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
of an English aptitude in English
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
language as defined in rules and to have
 
00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
a criminal background check and
 
00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
um essentially put guard veils on those
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are applying for that
 
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
license um the only thing that I noticed
 
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 align:start position:0%
um when when I looked at this last night
 
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
was that um it does submit an
 
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
application in fees established by the
 
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
board and that should be the office so
 
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
we need a small Amendment for that um
 
00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
other than that I hope that you'll
 
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
support the bill if you have any
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be glad
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
to representative leus yeah just uh
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
we've been in other uh subcommittees on
 
00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 align:start position:0%
other bills instead of by the board been
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
using the executive director because our
 
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is it should be a
 
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
person that's my suggestion for the
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
amendment well I'll take a look at that
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
levely amended amendment that I
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
presented to everyone on Friday and make
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh they all work together how's
 
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
that y thank
 
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you one other thing is just a
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
moment is that the licensing
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee worked on LNA requirements
 
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
and if they and they took that change
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
out of the bill so if there are any
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
other changes this would be the
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to incorporate them
 
00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
yep I'll speak with representative leus
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
about that okay yes one Amendment would
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
be easier all right represent Manti
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question to
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
part that what we worked on the
 
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee where the consistency of
 
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
the work office or executive director
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
and also how we combined
 
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
LNA under that clears up a lot more
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
confusion for me to look at it so that
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
would be fantastic thank you okay yep
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
Dutton hi my name is Carrie Dutton I'm
 
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
the owner and operator of LNA health
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
careers we're the largest LNA training
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire we a privately
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
run postsecondary trade school and we
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
graduate about 1,000 to 1200 lnas per
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
year and because of the current RSA we
 
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.309 align:start position:0%
year and because of the current RSA we
turn

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
turn
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
away on average 200 to maybe 400
 
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
individuals each year because they
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
cannot pass the standardized English
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
test and write an essay that would
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate their ability to read and
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
write in
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
English um these workers want to be
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers they're new Americans they're
 
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
not yet at the proficiency level but we
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
often lose these individuals after
 
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
sending them away to ESL classes and I
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
just think we would be better prepared
 
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
to care for our elderly in New Hampshire
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
and those who need care if we welcome
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
them into uh the workforce
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you represent M thank you madam
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
chair so these individuals they are
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
postsecondary um does that always J with
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
10 + 2 or is it 10 is the uh K through
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
10 some countries have that so do you
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
make that
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
distinction sorry we do not at the our
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
trade school level um but the high
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
schools the CTE programs are highly
 
00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
affected by this RSA they have programs
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
for new Americans and they can't welcome
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
them into the programs for LNA training
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
because of the English language
 
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
because of the English language
proficiency

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
proficiency
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
issue thank you I'm a bit
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
concerned what level of English would
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
these people have because I would hope
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to understand the nurses
 
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
or other people's uh
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
patients one thing about nursing in
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
medical terminology is it's a whole
 
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
different language than English itself
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
and so we would train the individuals to
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
do that and many times the few that do
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
make it back to us without going to
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
other entry-level jobs we're teaching
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
them although you learned English
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's this whole other language that
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're teaching you to enter the um
 
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.390 align:start position:0%
we're teaching you to enter the um
healthare

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
healthare
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce ah thank you that's good to
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
know any other questions representative
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well you
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
already touched on the issue that I
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh raise and that is uh the
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
the the I'm especially concerned about
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
the situation with
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
patients um who in many cases are going
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
to be elderly and and if if they are in
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
distress in any way especially and they
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
have somebody that that they communicate
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
their needs to who can't understand
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
English it's it's not only that they
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get their needs met
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
but they may have a a panic uh reaction
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh or um or something similar that will
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
make their situation worse than it was
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh when they needed something
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
besides understanding uh so um I I I
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
certainly can understand that it perhaps
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
you have an individual that's
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
hypothesized uh who speaks
 
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
Spanish uh and the patient speaks
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
Spanish well then they don't have to
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
Converse in English uh but if they speak
 
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
Spanish and the person is Vietnamese or
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
vice versa uh that's even worse uh so uh
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
how can changing the statute help I
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
understand that there are certain
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
technical terms but my understanding is
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
that lnas are largely doing non-medical
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
stuff uh as a matter of fact I think
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
they're not competent in many cases to
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
do medical things although they may
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
they're doing absolutely valid um and
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
important necessary functions such as
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
cleaning up messy situations not a
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
pleasant situation but it's got to be
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
done and and it needs to be done uh um
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
so again a foreign language can be very
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
helpful if you've got the patient
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
speaking that language so uh but but
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
English I I I think is absolutely
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
essential so how can dispensing with a
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
requirement for English skills uh
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
Advance our
 
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
cause yes thank you uh representative
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
schmith that's an important question and
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
all lnas would still resp be responsible
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
to meet the qualifications to take the
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
state exam and pass every LNA program
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
has a clinical portion with a skills
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
checklist to ensure that they understand
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
the most important words such as toilet
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
bathroom um walking call my family all
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
those things would still be included and
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
be required so it's not that they would
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
be only fluent in Spanish per se and go
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
work at conquered hospital they would
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
still need to know the important words
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
that their patient would be asking for
 
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
or requesting Services of it's also
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
important to know that um you know
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
roughly 75% of the individuals in LNA
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
would be caring for may not be
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
communicative so lnas do spend a lot of
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
time learning about anticipating needs
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
body language facial expressions and for
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
non-communicative um patients there are
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
often um pictures that patients can
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
point to to express their needs and we
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
as the educator would be making sure
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
that they are able to U perform all the
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
tasks required and communicate
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
effectively with their patients before
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
letting them take the state exam
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um mam chair and
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so what you've said is
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
helpful and for my understanding of the
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
situation but I I uh uh I happen to be a
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
linguist uh and I can uh read uh I don't
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
know at least to some degree in eight or
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
10 languages okay um and and in the
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
course of ordinary business I get bills
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth for example from uh Mass
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
General they're they they send a page
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
that has statement in English at the top
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
but it also has the same or equivalent
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
statement in 10 or 15 languages saying
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
if you need a a translator uh please
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
apply you're en tile one and so forth
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
and so on um and I I practice on my
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
other languages or new languages I'm
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
working with uh trying to
 
00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:11.959 align:start position:0%
read uh some language I that I'm not
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
very good at uh but the thing is do you
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
have something like that so the person
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
can look and see and find their own
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
language and at least say that that so
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know what language they're speaking
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh and because I'm sure that occurs that
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
you have people from a country country
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been discussing at this
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
point that you might have several
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
patients from that family so how do you
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to hold that you
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
know you turn it on and leave it on St
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very helpful thank you um so
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have tools like that
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
because the students are expected to be
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
able to read and write and speak fluent
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
English but we would love to incorporate
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
tools like that employer ERS may have
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
tools like that if they're hiring people
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
who need additional help if this is
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
approved I I'm concerned about primarily
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
about the patients because those are the
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
people who are in need uh and and and
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
very often elderly uh and they may not
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
have you know good communicating ability
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
not because of uh the the language that
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
they're that they're ex uh that they're
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
native to uh but because because they
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
are elderly and Confused uh and you you
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
you uh how do you how do you deal with
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
those people because they are your
 
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.509 align:start position:0%
those people because they are your
primary

00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
concern y that's the issue I have yeah I
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
think if whoever is responsible for that
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
individual in hiring the caregiver would
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
be responsible to have those additional
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
tools if they choose to hire someone
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
they don't feel is capable or at the
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
level to care for their patient
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
population um but I would ensure that
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
every LNA who graduated from my school
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
was prepared and ready to pass the state
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
exam and be Workforce ready with the
 
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.949 align:start position:0%
exam and be Workforce ready with the
skills

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
skills
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
required I would imag I would imagine
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
that the employer knows how many con
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
nonverbal or non-english speakers they
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
have in their their patient population
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brown and then man py
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um following up
 
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
on both those questions so on line
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
16 one of the new requirements is have
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
suff aptitude in the English language as
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
defined in the rules
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
adopted I'm guessing that would be oplc
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
writing those rules suggesting those
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
rules um so I don't know if you have a
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
feel for what sufficient aptitude might
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
mean So currently sufficient aptitude is
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
the student has to write an essay that
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
is in proper grammar that we can read
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
and is legible um and we give a
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
standardized test test um it's an ESL
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
test and we grade so we require an 80%
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
or better um and that's what the Board
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
of Nursing has approved for the old PLC
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's too high of a
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
standard I think we're leaving out a lot
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
of individuals that could be great
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
caregivers thank you and follow up you I
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
think you answer what I was going to ask
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
so we're at the sufficient aptitude
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
level now so if it says this in here
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
does that change where we are in your as
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
concerned I think yes I think it should
 
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
concerned I think yes I think it should
be

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
changed so if follow up again sorry
 
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.509 align:start position:0%
changed so if follow up again sorry
madam

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
chair if I'm understanding you it says
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient aptitude in the in the bill
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where we are right now and
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
you think maybe it should not say
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
specify the law says they must have
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
ability to read and write that's the
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
same as a as a licensed nurse so this
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
says they have sufficient aptitude which
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
would probably be a lesser standard well
 
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:18.350 align:start position:0%
would probably be a lesser standard well
that's

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you representative Mani
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh question when
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
you have the LNA training uh not only
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
language medical terminology do you also
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
have cultural sensitivity and uh
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
awareness um diversity and cultural
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
sensitivity yes okay we do how follow up
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair follow up how does that
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
impact being able to assess the cultural
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
a patient as well as the caregiver to
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
match does that give you an opportunity
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
to do that it does very much so so we're
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
able to teach about other cultures um
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
teach our students to be more inclusive
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
understanding we introduce them to
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
different cultures religions um
 
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.549 align:start position:0%
different cultures religions um
preferences

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
preferences
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you followup uh now with the
 
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.789 align:start position:0%

Aging
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
population uh in New Hampshire do you
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
see diversity in clientele or the
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
patients to not everybody's english-
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
speaking exactly yes we have a many many
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
um health care providers who the elderly
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
are optioning to stay home versus going
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
to a Center for Nursing Care and um
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's a very large population of many
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
different diverse cultures right now
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
in representative Dolan thank you madam
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
chair in the uh situation as you're
 
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.549 align:start position:0%
chair in the uh situation as you're
training

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
lpas and you find uh if this law were to
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
be changed and you find that they don't
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
have very good English or or um
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
communication skills along those lines
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
what do you teach
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
them uh to overcome that if they find
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
themselves in a situation where they
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
can't adequately communicate with their
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
patients what what do you what do you
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
what do they do and what do you teach
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
them to do yeah so this would open up
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
avenues for me to be able to have
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
additional um English training classes
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
whereas now my hands are kind of tied I
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
can't I really shouldn't be admitting
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
anyone to my school unless they're
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
proficient and meet the standard that
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
the RSA says but now I will be able to
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
do that I could maybe even advertise in
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
another language to attract those
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
beginning speakers and then further
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
development um their skills so that they
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
can pass the state test and meet the
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
standardized threshold for them to enter
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the workforce thank you okay other
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Simon
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh you keep
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
mentioning that they'll have to pass the
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
standardized test I'm assuming that the
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
standardized test is in English yes it
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
is okay so they'll have to be proficient
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
enough in the language to pass the
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
examination one way or the other correct
 
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
examination one way or the other correct
thank

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
you other questions thank you very
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
Courtney good morning Madam chair
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee lindsy Courtney
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
oplc um wish to thank representative
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
Gera for bringing this forward we fully
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
support the bill um nursing is very
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
unique in the sense that um other
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
healthc care professions other
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
professions that we license do not
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
require um one demonstrate the ability
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
to re and write in the Lang in the
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
English language in order to get a
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
license may be required to actually
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
practice your profession may be required
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
by your employer but it's not required
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
for lure purposes it is required um in
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
nursing um and I think the challenge is
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
that the test that folks have to pass um
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
represents a higher level English as you
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
as as you will um then you would
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily need in order to actually
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
practice your profession it's an it's
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
unethical for you to be able to provide
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
services to a patient that you can't
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
communicate with in any capacity um and
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
I think the statute really is
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
presumptuous and assumes that all of the
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
patients are going to be English
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
speakers which we know with the changing
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
demographics in New Hampshire that's not
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
always the case um if your patient
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
speaks Spanish and you don't have the
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
ability to communicate either in the
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
written or cues clearly you're not um be
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
you're not able to provide services to
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
that patient to those patients so this
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a pretty uh minor change
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
it allows the Board of Nursing some Flex
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
ability to still ensure that the lnas
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to be able to converse with the
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
patient in English but it does modify
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
the standards or give the board a little
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
bit flexibility to modify the standards
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
um to not uh require that they pass a
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
strict English uh written and um verbal
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
test and for that we fully support it um
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
I just want to note again Physicians we
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
bring them in from other countries they
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to take such a test um
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
dentists they don't have to take such a
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
test Allied Health they don't have to
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
take such a test uh nursing does so um
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's just something for you to keep in
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
mind and I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you
 
00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:42.310 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you
representative

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:44.919 align:start position:0%
gold so if I understand this uh thank
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
you madam Shar and thank you for taking
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
my question if I understand this
 
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
correctly what we're saying is that by
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
not putting that we're giving the
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
flexibility the nursing board will
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
decide what the proficiency level is and
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
that will be handled in rule as opposed
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
to be in statutory Authority the exact
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
amount of proficiency and it gives some
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility to make changes without this
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee having to go through the
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
legislative process is that right yes
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that's important
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
particularly with the changing
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
demographics that we see um among
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
patients um to give the board the
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
board's a little uncomfortable I think
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
um but I I think giving them that
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
flexibility is important as opposed to
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
having it set in
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.710 align:start position:0%
having it set in
statute

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Mani thank you
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair um the other professions
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
that do not require this do they have to
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
take TOEFL which is the the op foreign
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
language English language proficiency
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
test for foreign graduates we have to
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
take that in order
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
to get lenser or get into the profession
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
does that have anything to do with the
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
nursing if uh nursing has that so
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
nursing does have they do accept the
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
TOEFL RN LPNs um there's another
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
examination I believe that they accept
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
if um you have somebody coming in that's
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
foreign educated um and applying to
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
other medical schools it's possible that
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
the that the residencies or other
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
programs would require the TOEFL or
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
something comparable from a lure
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
that and I think that represents the
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between employment and lure
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
lure is supposed to represent the
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
minimum competency can you perform their
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
profession in order to perform it
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
ethically you have to be able to
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
communicate with your patient but the
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
patient may not speak English so um you
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
know is it an employment issue or is it
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
a lure issue
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
interesting question Simon thank you
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh and thank you for taking
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
my question and I appreciate uh
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
everything that you're saying about the
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
lure component of it just um trying to
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
finish wrapping my head around the um
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
State examination that's going to be
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
passed where they'll have to be able to
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
speak the language or understand the
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
language well enough to pass the exam
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
but then we're we're saying that there's
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
a lower standard that they should be
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
able to achieve in the language in order
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
to gain
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
lure what's the differentiation
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
like how can they read and pass the exam
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
if they're not also able to write a
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
short paragraph in the language it like
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
where where does that line kind of fall
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's question I do I think
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's something we're going to have to
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
work out in rules I think it's unclear
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
at this point in time um and I was
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually surprised to hear about the
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
essay because I think a large majority
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
of our high school students who are
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
native English speakers probably
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't wrate an essay with proper for
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
grammar um so I think that speaks though
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the concern is are we are the
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
requirements um too strict you know do
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
you need to write in perfect grammar um
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to provide competent
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
care to your patient um I think that's
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
something sorry representative but I
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
think that's something that would have
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
to be worked out in roles with
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders all right followup followup
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yeah so just for
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
clarification you don't you don't know
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
that line at this point when the bill is
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
being presented no okay no thank
 
00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:37.669 align:start position:0%
being presented no okay no thank
you

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
okay all right I I think that part of it
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
is that even if you grow up speaking
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
another language in this country your
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
vocabulary is not going to be as broad
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
as it would be if you were you know
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
reading serious books and so forth and
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
and even if some someone speaks both
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
Lang two two or more languages they
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
might need to uh get a refresher in
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
whatever okay anyone
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%

Hampshire will join the newly formed
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
compact which will allow social workers

compact which will allow social workers
from

any of the compact states to practice in
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
any of the other compact States
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
enhancing the portability of licensed
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
professionals improving continuity of
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
care when clients travel or
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
relocate and strengthening our Workforce
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the mental health Arena as well as in
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
many other practice areas where worker
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
shortages are at crisis
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
levels the compact has been developed by
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
the Council of state
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
governments The Association of Social
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
Work boards and the Department of
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
Defense it should be noted that the that
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
occupational interstate compacts are
 
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
particularly important to military
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
families who move frequently they
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
provide continuity of medical care and
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%

state

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
being new this compact will only go into
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
effect when identical language is
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
adopted by seven states thus far two
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
states have
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
adopted the compact language Missouri
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
and South Dakota currently legislation
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
is pending in 27 other States including
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Maine and
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont joining early means that we will
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to be part of
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
developing the rules which will Reg
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
ulate these multi-state
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
licenses currently New Hampshire is a
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
member of interstate compacts allowing
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire audiologists physical
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
therapists occupational therapists
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
nurses doctors psychologists and
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
licensed Mental Health Counselors to
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
practice in other states and vice
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
versa while social workers are critical
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
to our mental health Workforce well over
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
half of the mental health licenses in
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are social workers it is
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
important to note that social workers
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
practice in many areas including
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
education Child Protection medical
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections developmental disabilities
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
policy development and
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy I do not think I need to tell
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee about the
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
workforce shortages we face in all these
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
areas I sit on the board of one of our
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers and
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
every month we are confronted with
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
vacant positions High turnover rates
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
limited client access and and stories
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
about Cutthroat competition to fill
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
positions I certainly do not expect that
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
joining the social work compact will in
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
itself resolve our Workforce shortage
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
areas in the area of mental health and I
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
know this committee and oplc has already
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
made some important recent changes to
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
enhance portability of
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
lure the compact is one more tool that
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
will ease the burden of client cents and
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
professionals receiving and providing
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
Services across state
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
lines I first became interested in this
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
issue after being contacted by a large
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit counseling counseling
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
agency in Kean where I live the director
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
recounted many situations where they
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
would make a hire either from far or
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
near we we're very close to the Vermont
 
01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
border only to have the expected
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
employment languish for month after
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
month as the clinician attempted to get
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire often giving
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
up along the
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
way I want to address two questions that
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
people have brought to my attention as
 
01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
I've talked to people about this bill
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
first will joining the compact in any
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
way less than the quality of Eligibility
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
criteria for social workers practicing
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will it will
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
it will it lessen the quality of the
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
social workers practice here basically I
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
believe the answer is no a compact
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker will need a
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
degree from an accredited MSW program
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
pass passage of a national qualifying
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
exam and two years post-graduate
 
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.230 align:start position:0%
exam and two years post-graduate
supervised

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
supervised
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
experience the equivalent criteria for a
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire license and the equivalent
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
um criteria when I got my license um
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
ago second question once we have joined
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
what do we do if we disagree with the
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory language or are otherwise
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with the governance or
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
functioning of the
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
compact just as we can pass this bill to
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
adopt the compact we can at any time
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
pass legislation to end our involvement
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
in fact in 2021 we did just that passing
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
SB 133 to repeal participation in the
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
emergency medical technician
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
compact in summary I would ask you to
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of this important
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
animportant Common Sense approach to
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
enhancing reciprocity and reducing the
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden on those who provide
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
critical services to the citizens of New
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you are there
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
manip thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:08:16.679 --> 01:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
how

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
many let me phrase it in a way that I
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
can ask um you mentioned there are
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
certain uh professions that already
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
belong ideology is one that I'm very
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
um how many the states that all belong
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
in this uh compact
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
already for how long have they been and
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
how has their experience been represent
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
manager py he did testify that this is a
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
new compact it has not yet gone into
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
effect in any state
 
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore that's impossible to
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
answer I thought I heard as two or three
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
states have already joined that's why
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to ask yes but it has not yet
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
gone into effect in any state because
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
you need to have I believe was seven
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it won't it won't go into
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
effect until seven states have passed
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
identical language and the compact was
 
01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:21.590 align:start position:0%
identical language and the compact was
only

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%

postgraduate supervised clinical
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
experience would be required um I I
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%

you how clients can be negatively
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
impacted by their therapist not being
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
able to see them if they are outside the
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
state where the clinician holds a
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
license I will share two case scenarios
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
the client names have been changed and
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
no identifying information will be
 
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.950 align:start position:0%

Emma was a client I worked with off and
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
on since she was
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
13 at age 18 she left Massachusetts to
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
attend college in New Hampshire at the
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
time I was licensed in Massachusetts
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
only and this remained the case for most
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
of the time she was in college I was
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
able to meet with Emma only when she was
 
01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.310 align:start position:0%
able to meet with Emma only when she was
in

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts sometimes this meant her
 
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
coming home for the weekend specifically
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
so she could meet with
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
me diagnosed with an eating disorder
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
Emma would also occasionally struggle
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
with bouts of severe anxiety and
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
depression on one occasion when Emma was
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
struggling at
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
school she contacted the counseling
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
center and was told there was a two week
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
counselor in order to see someone sooner
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
Emma had to say she was experiencing a
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
Emma emailed at me emailed me at this
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
time told me how she was feeling and
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
said she wish she could talk with me but
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
understood that I couldn't legally see
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
her another woman I saw I'll call her
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
Jess had a mental health crisis while
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
state Jess was also a Massachusetts
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
client she had a trauma history and
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
suffered from anxiety with occasional
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
panic attacks Jess had entered into a
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
long-distance relationship with a
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
man uh with a man in the Pacific
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
Northwest during one of her trips out
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
west to see him he became very angry and
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
emotionally abusive and just emailed me
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
to let me know what was going
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
on she was feeling extremely anxious
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
stuck and wasn't sure what to do she
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
asked if we could
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
meet via email I asked some basic
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions to assess whether or not she
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
felt she was in danger and we briefly
 
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
discussed her options but I told her I
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet with
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
her I'm sure many of the clinicians
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
present today have had similar
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
experiences the more states that sign on
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the Social Work compact the better it
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
will be for clinicians and our clients
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
in addition it would also be less
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
expensive not to have to hold separate
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
licenses in separate
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
States holding different licenses a
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
clinician must also keep track of the
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of each state like the
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
number of continuing education credits
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
required every two years for example New
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires 40 and Massachusetts
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm licensed in Massachusetts uh New
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Washington State uh so um
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
I'm able to see folks that move in
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
between those States um but if someone
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
moves to another state uh no compact
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
exists at at the moment so we have to
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
try to quickly transition that client to
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
a new provider and and I know the U
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're all aware the shortages you know
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
weight list can vary depending on where
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
you are and if you have a long-standing
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
established relationship with a patient
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh that you've been seeing for quite
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
some time and then they're being moved
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
to another state uh it's hard to
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
transition someone let alone find a
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
provider um and what's often happening
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
is someone will move they're on a wait
 
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
list and there's no ability to do like a
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
warm handoff you maybe might send some
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
records a few months down the road but
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
you just can't offer that Psychotherapy
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
care if they're not in a state that
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
you're licensed in this compact will
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of that I know with my uh
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
mental health uh licensed uh clinical
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors I believe that
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
compact does have seven or more States
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
and it's in in enacted but uh I might
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
not be right about that but for example
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
if they were transferring someone uh to
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
another state
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
and they were part of that compact
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
that's already passed here in New
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they could still see that
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
person whether they want to continue
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
with that person or hand them off until
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
they find someone in person uh that's
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
good good care uh right now we can't
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
even do that with uh social work because
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
the compacts not even passed um but just
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
in general I think um having the ability
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
to not terminate care I my agency takes
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
Tri care uh which is a military
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
insurance and quite frequently people
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
are moving uh last week one of my
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
patients is moving to Washington hey I
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
get to still see them but a couple
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
months prior to that they're moving to
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
Arkansas another uh patient so I can't
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
see them uh it just uh it just it's
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
frustrating to patients they want to
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
stay with you and uh and then finding
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
someone that's qualified to provide the
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
care uh with all the weight L is is a
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
whole another thing so I'll keep my uh
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
comments brief right thank
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
you represent manager py thank you madam
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh for taking my
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
question are you clientele the
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
transitioning from one state to another
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
mostly younger High School to college or
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
college back that kind of or is it
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
across the board age-wise I would put
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
them in uh to different categories we
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
have the military category of folks who
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
are either uh in military or their
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
spouses uh as a patient and they're
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
being moved around or you have the
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
college kids that are going uh to
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
college uh who Maybe you've seen
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
throughout High School uh and now
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to Florida or uh Maine or
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
another uh State and um then you have
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
just the uh working professionals like
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
in NASA Bae is a very uh popular
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
employer in marac and everywhere else in
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
the State uh so you'll get a lot of
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
Engineers that'll be moving their
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
families around uh but they might be
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
here in nashille for a year and then
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
they have to move to another state uh as
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
part of their work uh so the the working
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
professionals is another group that we
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
see that are often moving and you know I
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't know about anyone here but let's
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
keep the phds working on nuclear weapons
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh in mental health care without losing
 
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
a provider when they're moving from
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
state to
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
state thank
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
ankle hello thank you um so much for the
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today I'm a
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical social worker and I
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
live in Hoppington New Hampshire before
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic I was um working in
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester um in a pediatric behav um
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
pediatric clinic um as an integrated
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health clinician so I saw all
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
my clients in person and then during the
 
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic um all of us had to switch to T
 
01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
Health which was something that everyone
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
had to adjust to um I was able at that
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
time started a new private practice and
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
saw you know all of my clients actually
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
just through the screen for the first
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
year um I will say it was amazingly
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
effective um really built strong
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
relationships with each of these clients
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
and then when that um ended now most of
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
my um clients in private practice are in
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
person occasionally um that will switch
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
to like because of weather or health um
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
to tell health so I think this tella
 
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
Health piece because it's so effective
 
01:19:54.629 --> 01:19:54.639 align:start position:0%
for behavioral health and mental health
 
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
is a reason why this compact um is so
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
important and will work so well I have
 
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
three situations where um I've had to
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
kind of um adjust because of the
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
inability to um have this social work
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
compact one is a client that I've worked
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
with for several years um as you
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
described a high school student I
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
started seeing her when she was in
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
Middle School in person and then she
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
went to college and we developed a
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
really strong relationship um and she
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
did has done so well but this was a huge
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
transition we know with youth these
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
transitions are times where of you know
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
where having support is really important
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
um I haven't been able to see her she's
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh because of the compact she's
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
actually in a state in North Carolina
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
and have seen her when she's come back
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
and she's made some trips back um for
 
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
that you know and made sure to see me um
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
evidence shows that for social work or
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
for um mental health that it is the
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
relationship that shows the is the most
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
important thing when we think about um
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
people doing well with their mental
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
health care that that relationship they
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
have with their clinician is the key
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
rather than you know the form or the you
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
the mode of um the modality of treatment
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
so being able to maintain this
 
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
continuity of relationships is really
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
important um often with youth they won't
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
find someone else they just it takes so
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
long to build that trust and
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
relationship that they will just wait um
 
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
the second um situation is actually
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
personal um I have elderly parents who
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
are um live in Massachusetts and who
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
have needed my care and as a result of
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
it I went ahead and got licensed in
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I don't have any clients
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts but for the sole
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
purpose that I'm having to go to um
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
support them and need to continue to be
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
able to have access to my clients in New
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I actually went through the
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
process of being licensed it was very
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
timec consuming and and costly and I'm H
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
I was happy to do it but it is certainly
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
a burden um the third was um I have a a
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
daughter who had a terrible ski accident
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
in Montana a year ago and so I had to in
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
an emergency go out and spend a month in
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
that state I went through the process of
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get licensed in
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
Montana I went and had to get
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted and did all the paperwork
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
but and decided that I was going to risk
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
my license to go I had to spend time
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
there I saw my clients online tell
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
Health but I was just going through the
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
process of getting licensed it actually
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
was going to take more than that month
 
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
to actually be licensed in Montana but I
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
had this dilemma um do I leave my
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
patients you know at risk and not having
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
any access to me or and do I you know
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
support my daughter who needed 100% care
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
so those were three situations where a
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
compact um you know kind of just would
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
play out and I really hope that you all
 
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
can support this today and thank you so
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
much for your time listening to my
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.719 --> 01:23:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
hello I I uh retired mostly from being a
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
private practitioner here in New
 
01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:23.149 align:start position:0%
private practitioner here in New
Hampshire

01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
on June 1st but I I'm also planning to
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
continue to do some Private teleah
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
health work I I was I worked at
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
Riverbend for seven years uh and then I
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
was in private practice a couple of
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
blocks away from here on Union Street
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and I I am very much in
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill I believe the
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
psychologists have already had the their
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
a psych pack I I think since
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
2019 and social workers do um very
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
similar work especially in private
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
practice um the times that I ran into
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
this issue were mostly with like the
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
what's already been said uh sco students
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
who I had treated that went away to
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
college uh and this would provide an
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity for continuity of care with
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
them also during the pandemic because we
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
did so much tella health it would be
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
much more convenient to be able to
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
continue to see people who were not in
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
town there were there or in the state
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
but I also treated a lot of people who
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh started working remotely and
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes one of my clients was working
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh from another state and wanted to
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
continue with care uh so so this came up
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
quite frequently and I'm very happy to
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
see this opportunity uh for this bill to
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
pass thank
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
peeterson thank you madam chair and
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
apologies for my being out of breath I
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
just ran up the back stairs from my
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh for nearly 30 years I've
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
been co-founder and part-time CEO of a
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
Wellness Center uh in Kingston that
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
combines family practice medicine three
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
providers counseling two Master's level
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
certified therapists and a massage
 
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
therapist over the years the lack of
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts has hurt us as we
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
sought to bring in trained professionals
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
with no black marks against them in
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
their records from out of state and in
 
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
two occasions they had to kind of cool
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
their Jets here in New Hampshire while
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
they went through yet another licensing
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
process here this bill if signed into
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
law would speed up the process for
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
organizations like mine a process which
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
I believe is
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I don't know all the details
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
in this bill but I do know that Lindsay
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
Courtney the head of our oplc was part
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the group that developed the one that
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
is in this bill and so if anybody says
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
well isn't there the danger that we're
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
not looking after New Hampshire
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
interests I think that's the answer to
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
that question so I would just encourage
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
us please pass this bill it will help
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
people who hire professionals like
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
myself to get our job done in a more
 
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.390 align:start position:0%
myself to get our job done in a more
expeditious

01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
expeditious
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
way thank
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
Courtney

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Lindsay Courtney
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc I wish to um
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 1190
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to explain why I think
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
this is uh a fantastic opportunity from
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
a portability standpoint but I do want
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
to offer my assistance in answering any
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the technical
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill um I would just
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
point out that much of this is a boiler
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
plate it cannot be changed absolutely
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
can't be changed in order for the
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
compact to be effective
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
um the sections that I think we should
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
be primarily concerned about are section
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
three which concerns outlines what a
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
state has to do to enter the compact in
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
order to be able to participate in
 
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
section 4 which explains what the social
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
worker has to do in order to be issued a
 
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.669 align:start position:0%
worker has to do in order to be issued a
multi-state

01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
multi-state
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
license I also just want to note that
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
there are essentially two different
 
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
types of compacts there's uh the compact
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's contemplated in in this bill
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
which is the the multi-state model which
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
is that you get a license in your home
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
state and you can practice in any other
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
compact state that's the model that
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
nursing uses and so you only have to
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
have one license one fee one set of
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
requirements other compacts use a
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice model which
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
requires the person to get licensed
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
initially in their home state and then
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
essentially apply to a body for a
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice they have to pay a
 
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.070 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice they have to pay a
separate

01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
um the difference there is that you know
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
who's practicing in your state so that's
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
basically the policy uh the policy
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind why you would choose
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
one versus the other in addition to
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
portability the compact offers uh the
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the states not the
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity requires the states to share
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
data um particularly regarding
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
investigations significant investigative
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
information and complaints and so I
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
think that's the difference between what
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
we did last year with House Bill 59 4
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
and essentially allowing for Universal
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
licensure in in New Hampshire um this
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
Pro provides an opportunity for us to
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
exchange that information so that we can
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
alert other states when there's
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
something going on that is not
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
considered public information but that
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
could impact that person's ability to
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
practice in that other state it provides
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
that information exchange and so I think
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
from that perspective is more protective
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the public then um traditional
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
portability uh would offer so section
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
four which you can find let's see
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
starting way at the bottom at page four
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
um and onto page five it outlines what a
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
social worker would have to do in order
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
to meet the
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and representative Brown
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
you asked a question regarding the hours
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
requirements and I would draw your
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
attention to looks like paragraph 4 um
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
this is where the 3,000 hours or the two
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
full years of postgraduate supervised
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
clinical practice is specified it's in
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
the social worker part of the bill um as
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the state participation part
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill um but essentially uh the
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
social worker would have to pass a
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
clinical category qualifying National
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
exam which we already require um attain
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
a master's degree fulfill a practice
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
requirement which is what we already
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
require beyond that I'd be happy to take
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
any questions but I know you have others
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify so I don't want to
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
take up too much of your time thank you
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative representa groa your
 
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.669 align:start position:0%
representative representa groa your
co-sponsor

01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
sir sorry representative um MTI thank
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um my question is with
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
the you said the nursing has this
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
portability so we can have the visiting
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
nurses from other parts of the country
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
correct will this open up that
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
recruiting or getting more help in
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
social work if this portability is
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
established for providers traveling
 
01:30:51.159 --> 01:30:52.390 align:start position:0%
established for providers traveling
providers

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so I what we so when we were
 
01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
yeah so I what we so when we were
drafting

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
this we felt very strongly that this
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
model was the better model for this
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
profession in particular because some of
 
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that you heard before me
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
surrounding teleah health and a client
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
going on vacation or a client um going
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
to college or um and and so for those
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
reasons we thought that uh allowing the
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility of not having to get the
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice every time
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
somebody opted to go to a different
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
state even
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
temporarily um would be the better fit
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
for this profession so it could
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
certainly help with
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting represent broa thank you I
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
have two questions the first question is
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the one of the
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
drawbacks to this to this type of
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
compact is that we have no say in the
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
compact itself which to some members of
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
the committee is a concern so can you
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
address that concern and I do have a
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to that after
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
so I think you have a say to the extent
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
that you can either choose to adopt it
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
or not you can also choose to um repeal
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
it um at any time and then the other
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
thing is that each state has to uh
 
01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
nominate or provide a delegate um to the
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
compact commission which participates in
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
the ru making obligation and I'm
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
currently the compact commission member
 
01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
for the Mental Health commission
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
essentially um we go and we we work with
 
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
the other state Commissioners and we
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
adopt rules um and there are
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
requirements and the notice and an
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard um as it relates
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
to rule making so I think the state does
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
have through that delegate does have the
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue to participate
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
compact I don't know if that answers
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
your question follow follow so so in
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
that rule making process do they have a
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
similar is the ru making process similar
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
to what we have in New Hampshire yes
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
there's uh notice there's public
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
meetings there's public hearings there's
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity for comment requirement to
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
comments it's very similar followup
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
followup and is that those public
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
hearings are they accessible by
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire they public
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
key notice for us or for other states
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
that are part of the compact yes they're
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
often held virtually um I do think the
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
compact commission meets once a year in
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
person if they can although there's
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
always members who attend remotely and
 
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
the public typically attends remotely
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
but they're welcome in in person as well
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
okay and last question follow up thank
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
you um why would New Hampshire choose to
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
withdraw from a compact what be with
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons that some like for
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
example in the EMT compact why we did we
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
withdraw from
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
that so I can't speak for the
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
legislature I think there were some
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about essentially it um
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
instead of bringing people in could
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
bring you know take people out of New
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but I think the primary
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
concern with a comact is one do we want
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
to promote
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
portability um yes I think we do do we
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
want to ensure Public Safety through a
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
standardized standardized set of rules
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
that the states have agreed to these uh
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
standards have been
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated by the participating States
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
and then as States enter into the
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
compact they agre ageing to that
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
contract it's both a contract and a
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
statute so for some states they are
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
basically um raising their standards
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
that they would otherwise typically so
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
we're all agreeing to the same set of
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
standards and I think from that
 
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
perspective it's to promote the public I
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
I I know that there's the argument that
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional I would disagree
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's hard for me to play
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate and and explain why you
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
would would would not join the compact
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Simon thank you
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you director for
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wasn't going to ask
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
it but you kind of alluded to it in your
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
testimony so I figured I might um is
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
there anything in the compact um that
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
would prohibit a large Social Work
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
Corporation from forming let's say in
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
Nebraska because Nebraska joined the
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
compact of driving down prices uh or
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
giving greater wages in that area and
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
since tella health is such a large
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
component of the compact as we've
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony to um basically
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
Outsourcing all of the on-site care in
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire out of state or a vast
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
majority of it to a large corporation
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then not having as many instate
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
clinicians as we presently have so
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
working the other way as opposed to
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
Bringing people in like you said we'll
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
be exporting people to some other state
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
that you know I I think if you allow for
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
portability there's always going to
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
be a potential that
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
people are going to relocate and
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
continue to seek to do services in New
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um what I would say to that
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
though is that we have a fantastic State
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't people who live here want
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
to keep living here
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
um practically I just don't see that
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
happening but you know I think that's a
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
possibility it's always a possibility
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
portability thank you very political
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
question answer to the question you've
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
been around us too long I think
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
um my other concern uh with this is you
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
you discuss the rul making process um
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
and on page 16 I believe it is of the
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
compact it says that um those rules
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
would have the force of law in all of
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
the states in which they're
 
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
implemented so I do have a concern so
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
clarify this for me if I'm wrong um that
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
although we would have a delegate on the
 
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.590 align:start position:0%
although we would have a delegate on the
compact

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
commission members from other states
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
who would be the majority because we
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
would obviously only be one um would
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability to basically create
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
laws that would go into effect in the
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire which we would
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
then have to be reactive
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
to is that correct I think that's true I
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
think the important thing to remember
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
about rules is that you can only adopt
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
rules provided you have Ru making
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
Authority so it's within the four
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
corners of of this bill what the ru
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
making Authority would be limited to um
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know what is the qualifying National
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
exam and I know that's very
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
controversial in the social work field
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
but what is the qualifying naal National
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
exam is is a question that the
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
commission is going to have to address
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
at some point you know if if the rules
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
were out of line with what we in New
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wanted to see then the only
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
choice would be to repeal it and and and
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
no longer participate in the
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
compacts thank you very much yes but as
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
we know the difference between Ru making
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
and lawmaking is that rule making is a
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more Nimble um and can happen
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit quicker than we were able
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
to so one of my concerns would be and
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm mistaken on this if a
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
rule were to pass say in May of of this
 
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
year say we were in the Compact and a
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
rule came in and we just really didn't
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
like it that basically puts us on our
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
heels until next January at the earliest
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
February maybe March we could be a year
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
out before we could adequately respond
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
to that rule would that not be the case
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's true although my
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
experience in being on being the
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Mental Health
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
compact is that the rule making process
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
is extremely slow goinging extremely
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
slow goinging we're still we're still
 
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
working our way through some rules right
 
01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.189 align:start position:0%
working our way through some rules right
now

01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
um and they're they're pretty basic
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
rules uh you know this is where you
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
would send in information or this is the
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
I guess is
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
there is there a particular issue that
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
you think would be somewhat
 
01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:03.159 align:start position:0%
problematic given the ru making
 
01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
Authority that's contained in the
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
document um if you could Point me
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm obviously looking at it um
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
one of our newer bills that I'm looking
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
at to where that is outlined in the in
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill itself so I can take a closer
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
look at that that would be helpful yeah
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
I think section speaks to um the ru
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
making Authority generally and it's
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
pretty basic or general and vague it
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
says the commission shall promulgate
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable rules in order to effectively
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and efficiently Implement administer the
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
purposes and provisions of the
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
compact um it also provides that the
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
rule shall be invalid if a court of
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
competent jurisdiction holds that the
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
rule is invalid so beyond legislation
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's always the opportunity to seek a
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
court order if if it's if the New
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes that the commission
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
has exceeded um the scope of its
 
01:39:53.599 --> 01:39:54.790 align:start position:0%
has exceeded um the scope of its
regulatory

01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.589 align:start position:0%
regulatory
Authority

01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
is discussed in the compact if you will
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the state participation
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
in the in in in the compact there's R
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
making authority of for that and then
 
01:40:17.589 --> 01:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's R making authority to flesh
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
out um the social worker participation
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
in the compact there's rule making
 
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.550 align:start position:0%
in the compact there's rule making
Authority

01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
regarding um who gets to be a delegate
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
um that's outlined in the compact but we
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
just did a rule for mental health um
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
concerning you know the nomination
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
process and how do we officially uh send
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
over a delegate um how do you issue the
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
license establishment of the compact
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
commission these are all the different
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
sections where you would have Ru making
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
authority pursuant to section 12 okay
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome in
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
the past some of the concerns that this
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee has had have been around fees
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
because the commissions do have the
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to charge and assess fees
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
our experience has been that the fees
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
are pretty nominal um I think nursing is
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
about $5,000 a year um I think we just
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
paid cacked and it was a couple of
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
thousand it wasn't it was very nominal
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
as a state we have the authority to pass
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
that cost on off onto the ly if we so
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
choose in New Hampshire we haven't done
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
that um essentially the default is
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a compact license if they
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for one or unless they don't
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
want one but other states do charge a
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
different rate for compact versus
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
non-compact but that's another area of
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
controversy that I think this committee
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
has raised in the
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
past good thank youone
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
chair you stated that you think
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
well my question is is portability with
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
when we look to nursing
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
compacts working as well as it should
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
at travel nursing agencies and travel
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
nurses filling positions for from state
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
to state and bouncing around from place
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
to place I think has driven up the cost
 
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.430 align:start position:0%
to place I think has driven up the cost
of

01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
healthare and not allowed folks or
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
individuals to stay in the places where
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
they're licensed but instead chase the
 
01:42:38.589 --> 01:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
dollar and what would prevent this
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
compact from having these individuals do
 
01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:44.149 align:start position:0%
compact from having these individuals do
the

01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:46.470 align:start position:0%
 
same

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
so I will say that without the nursing
 
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.310 align:start position:0%
so I will say that without the nursing
compact

01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
I we would not have been able to make it
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
through Co in the way that we were going
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
we we we were headed um I mean I was
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
getting calls on other professions
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
weekends nights can we issue this
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
license quickly I don't I have to shut
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
down this unit because we don't have a
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
respiratory care practitioner um can we
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
do this I think that's a separate issue
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
um Workforce that lenser is not lenser
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
is not going to Sol Workforce at all um
 
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
I think it be I think it can be part of
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
the solution in terms of eliminating
 
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary requirements but I think
 
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative what you what you
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
highlight is an issue that's that
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
concerns Workforce if we had enough
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce um to meet the demand then
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be this essential price
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
gouging that we see um but that doesn't
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
mean that we shouldn't offer people the
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility and remove unnecessary
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
barriers that portability presents for
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
around I think they're two separate
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
followup I I'll leave that issue go but
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
I will disagree on that um the other
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
question I have is I look at this and I
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:18.830 align:start position:0%
go to
page

01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
14 and can you tell me why this
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
commission needs qualified immunity
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
defense and
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
indemnification yeah I can because
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
essentially they're acting as a quas
 
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
state body um they're a public entity
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
because they're seated by state
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
representatives and so just like every
 
01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
other state official um and state public
 
01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
other state official um and state public
body

01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh who receives qualified certain
 
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
certain immunities this body does as
 
01:44:55.149 --> 01:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
well they're acting on behalf of their
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
state it's a public body and that's why
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
the delegate has to be either a board
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
member who's a state official or a staff
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
person uh like myself who's also a state
 
01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
immunity represent thank you so last
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
year we had um we representative goalie
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
reminding me of the registry that we put
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
in place for the traveling nurses we
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
might remember that yes I do and I
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
understand that in some cases rather
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
than going through this registry nurses
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
just decided to um come on board to New
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and work here in some of these
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
um either County homes or nursing homes
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
so first I'd like you to verify that and
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
second did did the compact help with
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
that because they were practicing in
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
another state this is about the nursing
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
compact is it kind of a loaded question
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah can you repeat the first part or
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
rephrase yes because we we because we
 
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
instituted this registry yes rather than
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
being registered some of these sorry
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
some of these traveling nurses just
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
decided to work just took a job at a
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
local place correct right yeah
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely so and then and did that give
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
was that part of that ability to quickly
 
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
pick up a job part of that portability
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
from the nursing compact absolutely I
 
01:46:33.589 --> 01:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
think I think nursing in particular but
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
I think we saw the greatest need with
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
interesting the data that we have which
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
is as you know very limited but the data
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
that we have from the emergency
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
licensing experiment experiment shows
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
that during covid where we saw where we
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
initially saw the greatest need in terms
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
of portability was in the mental health
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
professions because people were seeing
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
their clients in their
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
offices and literally overnight they
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
moved to a tele Health platform and if
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
they resided in Vermont and the client
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
was in New Hampshire now they need a New
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license where they previously
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
saw the client in Vermont the several
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
thousand initial several thousand
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses we issued were for
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
mental health providers primarily we
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have to issue nursing because
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
nursing could just work as long as they
 
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
were part of the compact um there is a
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
need here I think particularly for those
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances that were addressed by
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
folks previously um that I think will be
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
compact representative
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair sorry it's a
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's a long bill um so I'm not trying to
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
pick on you on anything oh you're fine
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
um so you had mentioned before for that
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
if there was concern uh you could
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that issue being in
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
interstate compact how does that work
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
what level of Court would hear that
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
adjudication the state in which it's
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
making the claim in the state court
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
would you have to go to a federal
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
circuit court where where would that
 
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
complaint be made in in a compact o I
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
think I would I want to research that a
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
little bit before I give you the answer
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
um sure that's fine and so maybe I can I
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
can follow it up with an email um I
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
discusses

01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
discusses
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
yeah my assumption would be Federal but
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
let me take a look at that and I can I
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
can send you an email and respond thank
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
much representative goalie thank you
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh one last question see he
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
brought up that
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
issue what would happen or how would a
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
case be
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
handled if there was an action brought
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
up on someone who was here in New
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on let's say a Texas
 
01:48:59.229 --> 01:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
license license E from Texas here in New
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does something egregious has a
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
complaint filed against them
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
M what then happens so I understand that
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
they have a Texas license home state
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
license and they're working here on a
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire license so under that
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
scenario New Hampshire could adjudicate
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
the matter and say you're no longer
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to work in New Hampshire because
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
we only can control what's in our
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because the home state is
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
in Texas we notify Texas Texas could do
 
01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.550 align:start position:0%
in Texas we notify Texas Texas could do
the

01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
same and by Texas revoking the license
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
it removes that person's ability to
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
practice in any of the compact States so
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
we always have the ability to adjudicate
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
claims in New Hampshire and to allow or
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
disallow tell people they can't work
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
here based on misconduct but if you are
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the home state
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
license if you take action that action
 
01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
um basically removes you from being able
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
followup so if there is a hearing on the
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
matter it's going to take place in Texas
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
for that license to
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
be whether it's the person's going to
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
maintain their license or lose their
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
license or whatever actions taken
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be a hearing in the home state
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
what H what would happen
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the individuals who would be
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor or one way or the
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
other from New Hampshire would they be
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
traveling to Texas to be at that hearing
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
to justify their concerns so we we could
 
01:50:32.669 --> 01:50:32.679 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing in New Hampshire and
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we typically do in
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
nursing um is we if the conduct occurred
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where all the witnesses
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
are located we hear it in New Hampshire
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
um and typically because you know based
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
on reciprocal discipline states are
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
um they don't they can't collaterally
 
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
attack uh a finding of another
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so Texas could certainly
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
hear it
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
um as well um and adjudicate the claim
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
my experience has been that we work
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with that jurisdiction
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to handle testimony
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
and the like but we often have witnesses
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
who appear in our cases remotely and
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
courts I mean it's very common for
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
follow

01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
up it's kind
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
of it was could be in New Hampshire but
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
could be in Texas yeah so it my question
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
is where is it happening because I mean
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
I I would like to
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
know if it was a New Hampshire liccy and
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
was working in
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
Texas and something happened down in
 
01:51:49.679 --> 01:51:50.709 align:start position:0%
Texas and something happened down in
Texas

01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
Texas
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
to get their license revoked in New
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it took place in Texas
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to just go by what they
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
said in Texas instead of I thought the
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
law here in hampsh was that you have to
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing or an appeal if they
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
choose to appeal
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
that so I apologize there's a lot to
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
unpack um and I don't want to give you a
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer response but it's always going to
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
be it depends it depends on the facts
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
and that's the case whether you're part
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the compact or not so what we're
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
talking about is the comact you know do
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
you want to have lenes be able to
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
practice in states with one license or
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
do you want them to have to get a
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
license in every other state so under
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
the scenario that you presented me
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
somebody is originally from Texas has a
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
Texas license let's say they're not part
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
of the compact has a Texas license comes
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire has a New Hampshire
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
license commits misconduct in New
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we adjudicate that claim that
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
person has and we notify Texas through
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
the National Practitioner Data Bank they
 
01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:50.669 align:start position:0%
the National Practitioner Data Bank they
get

01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
notification and there's a a theory of
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
the law basically you've already had one
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple to dispute whether the
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
facts happened as they as they did and
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
so Texas has to have a hearing in order
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
to discipline you but the question is
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
not did you commit the misconduct the
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not we should
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
impose sanctions based on the finding of
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Court that's
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with how courts handle it and
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
that's how administrative bodies handle
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
it now that same scenario would happen
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
under the compact but the question is
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
are we talking about one license or we
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
contact correct and so you could
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
adjudicate in New Hampshire you could
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
say you no longer have the option to
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire if they had a
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
Texas Home State Texas would take a look
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
at it and they would say okay we don't
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
want you working anywhere because we
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
have the home state we're going to
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
revoke your license and now you don't
 
01:53:55.149 --> 01:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
have a compact license and you can't
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
work anywhere New Hampshire can only
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
take away what's in New Hampshire but
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
because Texas is the home state it can
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
take away your opportunity to work
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere but it's not unlike what we see
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
under the other scenario which is
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
non-compact the compact is not going to
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
change the way we address it I guess is
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.189 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you madam
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
question on page
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
16 under the at the bottom of the page
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
under the rules the commission um shall
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
have the force of law that uh
 
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative Simon had mentioned it
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that if the state has
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
laws on the books that are contradict
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
with the rules the commission comes up
 
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
with then the state law supersedes the
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
rules is that correct yes that's what it
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
states and follow follow so is there so
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
that means that if the state was in
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to a rule the state could
 
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
enact a law that would counteract the
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
rule correct they could thank
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.599 --> 01:55:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%

than half of people with a mental health
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
condition in the US did not receive any
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
treatment Nomine Hampshire has heard
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
countless stories of people who were
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
given a list of up to 20 providers by
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
their insurance um just to discover that
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
none of them were accepting new patients
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
the average delay between the onset of
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
mental illness symptoms and treatment is
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
11 years when individuals with mental
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
illness receive the right services at
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
the right place at the right time fewer
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
folks will end up homeless hospitalized
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
or incarcerated this bill would help to
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
address the mental health Workforce
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
shortage in our state expand access to
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
care for granite Staters and enable
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
continuity of care for existing patients
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we urge you to vote
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
OTP for this bill happy to answer any
 
01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll defer technical
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
youy thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um Nami New Hampshire
 
01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
is a chapter of the national chapter and
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
you have several programs in terms of
 
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention first episode
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
psychosis and those kind of stuff how
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
does this back up the policy aspect of
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
Nami that's providing to the health care
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
providers shortage or programs access to
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Providers thank you for
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
your question uh if I understand it
 
01:57:37.069 --> 01:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
correctly um this would not expand
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
access to our programs as I understand
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
it but of course from a policy
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
perspective it is our priority that uh
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
folks who need Services get access to it
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
and we see this bill is doing just that
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Simon thank you
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair um perhaps you would be able
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
to clarify this question for me um we
 
01:57:58.589 --> 01:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
know that there's a shortage in the
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is there a
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
surplus someplace
 
01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:04.030 align:start position:0%
surplus someplace
else

01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't mean that to be
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
tongue and- cheek it just seems like if
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage everywhere I'm just
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where the
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
additional Workforce is coming to
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
lighten the the load or or how you see
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
that working sure uh thank you for the
 
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm not a Ware of a surplus I'm
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
sure there there are other states that
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
um have a higher population have less
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
rural areas we know specifically for
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
people in rural areas of the state um
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
they they are seeing that shortage more
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
than some people in the southern aspect
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
of the state and tell Health would open
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
that up but I'm not aware of an existing
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus that I could speak to thank
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair following
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
up on representative Simon's
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
I if we have a reciprocity situation
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
which we do in a number of our
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
professions isn't already the case
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
people could come here to New Hampshire
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh based on as one of the earlier
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses testified this is such a
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
desirable place to live as long as you
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
got an unlimited wallet um uh such a
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
desirable place to live that we are
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
already attracting people from other
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
areas to come and practice their
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
profession here is not that that not the
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
case in
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
in response to representative Simon's
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
situation as well thank you for the
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
question I think it is absolutely true
 
01:59:28.109 --> 01:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
that many people moved to New Hampshire
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
for uh a lot of the Fantastic things it
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
has to offer um but this bill goes
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
beyond that to college students who
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
maybe grow up here go out of state want
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
to maintain continuity of care uh people
 
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
who winter in a different state and want
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
to maintain continuity of care it's
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
important for that aspect as well thank
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
you representative gold thank thank you
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
question having a family member who uses
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
these services and fits the um scenario
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
you described even when there is not a
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
surplus of
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
workers do you find that the lag in
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
services that can be created by waiting
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
on the wait list to find a replacement
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
provider when there's not um this is
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the well-being of those
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
seeking Services thank you for the
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
question yes absolutely any delay in
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
treatment when it is absolutely critical
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
can lead to progression of the
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
seriousness of the illness that can see
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
real drastic negative
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes thank
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:01:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
snow

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and members of
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for your time today I
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
will be very brief because it feels as
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
if many of the points I wanted to make
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
have already been made quite
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
articulately by other members of this
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
making a presentation but I would simply
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
say my name is Ken snow
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
I'm from
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester I have been in New Hampshire
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
for since
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
1966 and been an active participant in
 
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
and witness to the development of the
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
community health system in this state
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
which in many ways we can be very proud
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
of and you people have all played a
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
great role in that along with a lot of
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
other people across the state that have
 
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
worked very hard over the years to
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
change what was at one time a very
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
primitive kind of system of care into a
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
much more modern system of care this is
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
a bill that attempts to fine-tune that
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
and do it an even better job by
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
maximizing the opportunity for us to
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
attract qualified uh practitioners to
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
come into the state and and and and to
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
work along with the rest of us to make
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
that happen uh I would I understand your
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
concerns and I'm glad you're looking at
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
this so carefully I do just comment as
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
my it was my impression having read this
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
very lengthy Bill myself that the answer
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
to representative goalie who I know he's
 
02:02:19.709 --> 02:02:19.719 align:start position:0%
also from Manchester
 
02:02:22.069 --> 02:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
we know each other I would simply say
 
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the Hampshire still
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
controls what happens in the Hampshire
 
02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
no matter what happened in Texas they
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
can rule either go along with New
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or not but in the end that
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
person still cannot practice in New
 
02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we still have control over
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
that and I I hope that somewhat
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
reassures people that we're not subject
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the whim of another State's decision
 
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
how it impacts how our citizens are
 
02:02:49.629 --> 02:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
going to be served uh and unless there
 
02:02:52.069 --> 02:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
are any other questions I I I I can only
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
say it's been my privilege to be a
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
member of nasw which is a National
 
02:02:57.149 --> 02:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Workers I
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
celebrated my 62 years as a member of
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
that organization and I've been an
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
active Advocate mental health ever since
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I hope I'll have the opportunity
 
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
to continue doing that thank you very
 
02:03:11.149 --> 02:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
much for your time thank you for your
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
Perry

02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Warren Perry
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy agent general for New
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran service Services uh
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
in that role we oversee uh you know
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
essentially the the veteran and Military
 
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
and their families constituency of the
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire as it uh uh as it
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
pertains to services and you know
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
resources that are available to them we
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
believe that compacts are generally good
 
02:03:57.549 --> 02:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
right they increase access to services
 
02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
and they increase the ease by which uh
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
transitioning military members can
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
continue to get licenses and practice as
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
they move into or out of the state of
 
02:04:08.589 --> 02:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so from that perspective
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
the department endorses the law I I
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
would make two comments one is this we
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
testified similarly to the the exact
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill that passed the Senate on February
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
8th uh in the senate senate 318 I'm sure
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
you're all aware of and to
 
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Simon's question about
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus versus you know deficit of
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
services I would submit that if it's
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
easier to get licenses and to get care
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
in more places because we have a compact
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
then we more efficiently use the limited
 
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
resources that we have so I would just
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
look at it not necessarily from a surf
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
Surplus and deficit perspective but from
 
02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
now we have a bigger pool of resources
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
that we can tap into and they can be
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
more efficiently used so I I I try to
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
look at kind of glass half full kind of
 
02:04:52.589 --> 02:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
perspective of that that perspective so
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's my
 
02:04:56.109 --> 02:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
statement and I'll I'll be happy to
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
representative Simon the maner py thank
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
question um and yeah no I mean I feel
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
like representative G's point was well
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
made and and I had that in consideration
 
02:05:10.549 --> 02:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
when I asked the question as well that
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
um I think they're two different issues
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
um continuity of care obviously it's
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
good to keep somebody with a
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
practitioner we think that's fairly
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
obvious uh my question was more along
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
the lines of if each practitioner is
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
already stretched to their limit um how
 
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
does opening up this you know uh
 
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
increase the pool you know so that
 
02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
there's there's more access to more care
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
because everybody's already strapped now
 
02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to me that if
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
everybody isn't actually all you know
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
strapped with their maximum amount of um
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
patients then then that that could be of
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
assistance but all the testimony that
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
I've heard today is that they end up on
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
a waiting list for four weeks six weeks
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
because they can't get in to see anybody
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
because they're already booked up and
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have room for for more
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
patients so just wanted to make sure
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
that I clarified my question and if you
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
have anything that you could add to that
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
that' be be grateful I certainly don't
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
disagree with your with your premise I
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
mean nobody has enough hours in the day
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
to get all the work done that they need
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
to get done but if we create places
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
where we can get into the system more
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
places that we can get into the system
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
we can more efficiently use the limited
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
resources so I certainly agree like as a
 
02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat like how do we create
 
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
capacity in the system is like one of
 
02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
the things I try to do every day so I I
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
didn't disagree with you I just offered
 
02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative view yeah thank
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
you man py thank you madam chair thank
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh two part
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
one is in terms of tele medicine and
 
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
using that
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
resources of how did that impact during
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
the covid and having access to Tele
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
medicine in the rural areas in New
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah so thanks thanks for the
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
question I'm not I'm not a social worker
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in tele medicine so
 
02:06:53.709 --> 02:06:53.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say I know that the VA
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
used it effectively uh use tele medicine
 
02:06:58.830 --> 02:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
effectively to get services to people
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
you know to my way of thinking it's not
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
the best way to do business but it's
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
better than nothing so that that's
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's just me I'd rather meet in person
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm going to not answer your
 
02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
question because I just I'm not an
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
expert on tele medicine or the impact of
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
it I do know that the VA used it very
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
effectively both for physical health and
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
mental health during during Co
 
02:07:19.079 --> 02:07:21.030 align:start position:0%
mental health during during Co
thank

02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%

02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
National Association of Social Workers

New Hampshire chapter I am a licensed

Penacook previous uh testimony has
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
really covered a lot of the points that
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
I was uh that I would make I will
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
highlight this helps social workers in
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
that they do not social workers already
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
have especially along the borders
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
multiple licenses they already have them
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
they've they if they have
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh clients who go to Florida in the
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
winter time they've already got the
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
teleah health license in Florida the
 
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
thing is that they're paying pay for
 
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
that thousands of dollars every year
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
every other year the
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
multi-state uh Social Work compact will
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of that cost that social
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
workers are are paying right now this is
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
a benefit to New Hampshire citizens who
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
are clients
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
they students who go off to college
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
people who go off uh in the in the
 
02:08:49.069 --> 02:08:49.079 align:start position:0%
winter time one of the ways ways that it
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
will impact uh Workforce is when a
 
02:08:58.109 --> 02:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
student from let's say Vermont goes to
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
un they have a therapist a social worker
 
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
that they're already seeing when they
 
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire they'll be able to
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
continue seeing that social worker they
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
will not need to find a new one here
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
right so that has there there isn't one
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
spot being taken up if you will this
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
also helps our agencies when a social
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
worker who is licensed in another state
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
moves to New Hampshire and they got a
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
job they now need to wait until they are
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire in order to
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
start seeing clients that can that can
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
be a few weeks that can be a couple
 
02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
months with the social work compact a
 
02:09:48.189 --> 02:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
social worker coming from a uh a state
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
that that is part of the compact will be
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
able to start day one they'll be able to
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
start seeing
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
clients which is a benefit to our
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
clients to our agencies and to that
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
social worker who would like to start
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
making a living as soon as possible
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh the the issue about uh traveling
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
social work is in so traveling nurses
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
has come up
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
because I work with student Social Work
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
students I'm always looking at indeed
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to see what jobs are out
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
there I I see traveling nurse ads all
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
the time I've seen one over the last few
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
years one ad for a traveling social
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
worker it's just not a thing it's just
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
the the reason the the the primary
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
difference I think between the social
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
workers and the nurses is a lot of this
 
02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:47.559 align:start position:0%
work is being done through telea Health
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's not nobody's traveling any place
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
are there going to be exceptions to that
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sure um however the the traveling
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
Social Work piece is just not something
 
02:11:05.310 --> 02:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing happening um as far as
 
02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:07.069 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing happening um as far as
big

02:11:07.069 --> 02:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
big
 
02:11:09.069 --> 02:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
companies you know mental health
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
corporations we're already seeing that
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a great equalizer it gives
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
people a lot of access uh but from a lot
 
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
of uh feedback that I've received from
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
social workers is that it's a lot of
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
puppies and sunshine for the first
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
couple months and then the reimbursement
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
pretty like a third less than what uh
 
02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
insurance and Medicare and Medicaid is
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
paying now so I'm not sure how long that
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to be that's going to be a
 
02:11:43.069 --> 02:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
thing but but it will open it up so that
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh those social workers who are working
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
for those
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
corporations uh will be able ble to see
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
a greater number number of clients which
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
from an equity standpoint is is good
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
news for for
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
clients I'll I'll leave my testimony
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
right there and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:12:06.030 --> 02:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have thank
 
02:12:08.589 --> 02:12:08.599 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
question you stated that there really is
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
no traveling social work out there now
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
but is it not correct there is no
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
compact unlike a nurses who have a
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
compact as the reason why there's no
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
traveling social workers I thank you for
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
the question everything is is possible
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
but for many social workers who will be
 
02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
utilizing this compact it's for
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy it's for telea health
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
right it's either because the social
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
worker has gone someplace or the client
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
has gone someplace and being able to
 
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
care I believe the the difference is a
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
hospital or a where they're attending to
 
02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
physical health they need that nurse
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
care that isn't usually the case with
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
social workers that that it is a
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
requirement that that that that that
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
position be filled I know there are
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that but it's it's just
 
02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:25.559 align:start position:0%
not the
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
same work requirement and the that the
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
social worker M must be present and on
 
02:13:38.189 --> 02:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
staff follow follow and then the other
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
statement you made and a lot of other
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
folks have made is that they can
 
02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
continue their continuity of care with
 
02:13:48.549 --> 02:13:48.559 align:start position:0%
their client if they should travel
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else outside of New Hampshire
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
sure isn't it only true they can
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
continue that care if the state that
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
client goes to is part of the contact
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
correct and from what I'm hearing now
 
02:14:03.069 --> 02:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
the only two states that are are
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
Missouri and south coda is that correct
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you we have the
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
model legislative language didn't come
 
02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
out until February of last year which
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
was too late for
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
most legislative sessions and then you
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
have Montana that meets 990 days every
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
two years so it's all over the place
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
this is the first full legislative
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
session that Most states have where it's
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
been able to be introduced Missouri and
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh South Dakota
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
have gotten there uh I believe 27 other
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
states it's uh being heard um I think it
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
just came off the house floor in Vermont

dejoy I'm here today representing the
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Psychological Association
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
NH HPA is a membership organization
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
which represents psychologists in the
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire what's coming
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
around is testimony from Dr Julie Walter
 
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
Dr Julie Walter is the chair of the
 
02:16:55.870 --> 02:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
behavioral health advisory committee uh
 
02:16:58.349 --> 02:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
who I directly work with on advocacy
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
issues uh she's asked me to convey to
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
you that nhpa strongly supports this
 
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
compact uh and to speak briefly to the
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
cact so as you heard this is not the
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
first compact newshire ented into it is
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
one in the line in fact there have been
 
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
four there have been four other comp
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
four this would be the fourth compact um
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
in The Last 5 Years the first of those
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
was in 2019 which were the psychologists
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
referred to as cypa um there were only
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
six states that adopted cypa seven
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
states adopted cypac before New
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did which made New Hampshire
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
an early adopter of the psychologist
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
compact today there are 41 states that
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
have adopted it and there are five
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
others that have active legislation
 
02:17:46.719 --> 02:17:48.270 align:start position:0%
others that have active legislation
currently

02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:17:50.669 --> 02:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
the speed with which that compact has
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
grown indicates the need for portability
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think this would be very much the
 
02:17:58.270 --> 02:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
same that while there are 27 States now
 
02:18:00.429 --> 02:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
considering it in the next several years
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
it is highly likely there will be many
 
02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
many more um with that I will end my
 
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
you representative man py you remembered
 
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
your question I take it I
 
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
did thank you madam chair so typically
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
what is the length of treatment or the
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
continui needed in social work or mental
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
health as this case is how long
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
typically what's the length of um
 
02:18:36.669 --> 02:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
engagement between the provider and the
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
which needs the continuity thank you
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
very much for that question and while I
 
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
am a social worker I'm not a clinical
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
social worker so I would prefer to defer
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
that question to one of the clinical
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
social workers in the audience audience
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps Miss Stanley that was my
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
you I think it would be fair
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative maner py to say it's a
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
long time because someone testified that
 
02:19:05.389 --> 02:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
a middle schooler was in treatment
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
throughout high school and into college
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
so you're talking 10 years that that was
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
my contrast I was trying to draw with
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
the nurses coming to a clinical which is
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
short term
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does anyone else wish to
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
hearing what's
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
that well since we have two
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees at 1:00 I don't think
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote on this although I
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
had planned to

um all right one what I want to start
 
02:40:04.349 --> 02:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
out with and is there were some
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh significant changes to the whole um
 
02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
the PA statute that was U from Senate
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 228 in uh 202 two and questions
 
02:40:20.349 --> 02:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
have been raised by some people as
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
to U you know what how what impact that
 
02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
had why people see a need for something
 
02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:27.750 align:start position:0%
had why people see a need for something
further

02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
so um you know if there's somebody who
 
02:40:32.269 --> 02:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
is in support of this bill maybe
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
representing the Pas if you could come
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:57.269 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.469 --> 02:40:59.479 align:start position:0%
um why don't you just come up and we'll
 
02:41:01.389 --> 02:41:01.399 align:start position:0%
we'll work through it
 
02:41:03.389 --> 02:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
but just
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
me for now yes
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
sir unless I don't think someone's going
 
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
to sit on your lap
 
02:41:15.150 --> 02:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
so that would go viral yeah not for any
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
good re
 
02:41:19.150 --> 02:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
reason Mr chair for the record my name
 
02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
is David czy uh with Prospect Hill
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
strategies and I'm representing the
 
02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
Society of New Hampshire Society of
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
physician assistants I was the one who
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
testified on their behalf during the
 
02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
hearing and as I mentioned uh we do have
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
representatives from the from nispa as
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
well as the American Academy of Pas who
 
02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
are uh in from out of town actually um
 
02:41:43.150 --> 02:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
if they're in a better position to
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions I have but
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
I guess first if they're from out of
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
town I'll ask you for you the question
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
on 228 since that's a New Hampshire sure
 
02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:53.550 align:start position:0%
on 228 since that's a New Hampshire sure
uh

02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:57.870 --> 02:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
issue so uh I think if I understood the
 
02:41:59.630 --> 02:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
question uh correctly you were saying
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
okay we just we passed
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
228 now here uh in Senate Bill 228 two
 
02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
years ago and now here we are with House
 
02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:08.910 align:start position:0%
years ago and now here we are with House
Bill

02:42:08.910 --> 02:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:42:13.150 --> 02:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
1222 um
 
02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
so the Nisa did
 
02:42:18.910 --> 02:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know request that Senate Bill 228
 
02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
be introduced a few years ago and that
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
was the goal then was to take the first
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
step to
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
modernizing PA statutes and regulations
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire to recognize uh
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
modern how modern Healthcare is
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
delivered in the team setting uh and
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
that passed unanimously in both the
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and was signed into
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
law by the governor uh the regulations
 
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
are I think now you know as we all know
 
02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
that takes time then for the regs to
 
02:42:48.190 --> 02:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
catch up but they're uh I believe now
 
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
final so that's in place uh and the what
 
02:42:55.230 --> 02:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
the big there were two big changes in
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
that bill uh the first big change was
 
02:43:02.830 --> 02:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
that it got rid of the concept of
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
supervision in statute and in regulation
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
so going back many years when the PA
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
profession was uh
 
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
first uh first came to be they were more
 
02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
like assistance to Physicians and so as
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
time went on anytime they the state
 
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
state law said that there needed to be a
 
02:43:26.030 --> 02:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
um a supervis an RSP a responsible
 
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
supervising physician form um signed by
 
02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:30.630 align:start position:0%
supervising physician form um signed by
a

02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
doc that that doctor as time has gone on
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
the rules had changed so that that
 
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
doctor uh or any physician had to be
 
02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
either in the building or accessible by
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
electronic means when when the PA was
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine uh
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
now the concern was that of course and I
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
think we've all had PA care for us it's
 
02:43:56.910 --> 02:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
not like and I used the example at the
 
02:43:59.070 --> 02:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
hearing it's not like a new waiter or or
 
02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
waitress where they have the manager
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
kind of s behind them right there right
 
02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
there please please well and so as we
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
know the docs you know doctors are not
 
02:44:12.030 --> 02:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
supervising Pas when they're providing
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
care and so as time has gone on the
 
02:44:16.349 --> 02:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
thought was let's remove the concept of
 
02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
supervision and let's change it to
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
collaboration because that's what modern
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
Healthcare teams do if it's NPS if it's
 
02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
Pas and so that's what Senate Bill 228
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
did it change the language to turn make
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
that a collaboration agreement and
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
actually set forth an statute that Pas
 
02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:33.630 align:start position:0%
actually set forth an statute that Pas
shall

02:44:33.630 --> 02:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
shall
 
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
collaborate but the collaboration
 
02:44:37.469 --> 02:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
agreement still had to be signed by a
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
physician so there was still that legal
 
02:44:42.429 --> 02:44:42.439 align:start position:0%
tether to a dock and no other provider
 
02:44:46.269 --> 02:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
NPS don't have that at all and so we
 
02:44:48.030 --> 02:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
made that change it was a good first
 
02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
step uh and then the other important uh
 
02:44:53.790 --> 02:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
change was that it removed it did remove
 
02:44:56.349 --> 02:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
the liability of that physician who
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
signed that document so just because
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
they have their name on that document
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't mean they could be held
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for the care that the PA
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
provides of course if they were somehow
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the care of that patient
 
02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
then naturally they should be so that
 
02:45:13.710 --> 02:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
that was also important because that
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
liability um
 
02:45:18.429 --> 02:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
made it so that doctors would have to
 
02:45:20.349 --> 02:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
carry either additional liability
 
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
insurance they had to be compensated for
 
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
that because they were responsible so
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
those were the two big
 
02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:28.429 align:start position:0%
those were the two big
changes

02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
um we were not aware that representative
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
Roser was bringing in HB 1222 this year
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and so we had always told we nispa
 
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
and I just the conquered lobbyist had
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
always told my colleag colleagues from
 
02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
the if it was a medical association or
 
02:45:50.190 --> 02:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
the other folks in town hey look you
 
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
know we are going we do want you know to
 
02:45:56.670 --> 02:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
remove that signature that legal tether
 
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
um it's called independent practice but
 
02:46:00.190 --> 02:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's really not that's a misnomer
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
because no no no healthc care provider
 
02:46:05.230 --> 02:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
Prov uh practices independently they all
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
consult with each
 
02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
other but nonetheless I said when we do
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we're certainly going to be
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
transparent we'll talk Etc then here was
 
02:46:17.150 --> 02:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and so I said you know again
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
tactically politically you know we
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
didn't you know representative roach did
 
02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
this but now we realize you know it's
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
long been since time if if NPS if nurse
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners can practice without any
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a collaboration agreement with L
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
education and less training right out of
 
02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
school then certainly a PA should be
 
02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
able to do the same if they've been 25
 
02:46:40.830 --> 02:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
years into a career let alone maybe you
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
know a year or two out of school and so
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
we realize that there might be some
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
support and so we came to the hearing we
 
02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
provided information and we said you
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
know this wasn't I guess for lack of a
 
02:46:55.110 --> 02:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
better way to phrase it wasn't our idea
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
to do this now but here we are and so um
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
that I think is is where we are today uh
 
02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative and I I apologize for
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
being typically longwinded that's okay
 
02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and to members of the subcommittee
 
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
what I uh I don't want to block
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
questions what I'd like to do is um get
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
somebody from uh the who came here
 
02:47:17.710 --> 02:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
representing the PA Association and then
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
see if anybody wants to speak on the
 
02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
other side and then if we have questions
 
02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
if if that's
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
acceptable and I did email over what was
 
02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
your name again uh my name yes David czy
 
02:47:33.389 --> 02:47:33.399 align:start position:0%

like kind of a myths and facts about Pas
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then the education and experience
 
02:47:43.150 --> 02:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
side by side with Pas and nurse
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners does anyone need a hard
 
02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
copy of that CU I have copies here take
 
02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
it if you got it okay yeah I'm all set

but yeah you can I see over there sorry
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
how are you I would all right um so you
 
02:47:58.750 --> 02:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
said someone was here from the so Sarah
 
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
Lesley is the is the VP of the New
 
02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Society of physician
 
02:48:04.990 --> 02:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
assistants she's a PA here in New
 
02:48:06.910 --> 02:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire she's here and we do have
 
02:48:09.790 --> 02:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
folks from the American Academy of uh
 
02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
physician assistants from Washington uh
 
02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
here as well so I I respect suggest they
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer some of the more
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
technical questions I can handle the
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislative policy type stuff why don't
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
we start with U Miss Lesley and we may
 
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
call you back up if we have questions
 
02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
for you thank you I'll hand these out in
 
02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
y

02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
y
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes I I believe I'm not on the
 
02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee correct so I I it may be
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm supposed to be down in 104
 
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
right at the moment but I can't be in
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
two places at one time but I'm very
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill so and I know
 
02:48:48.670 --> 02:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
you'll allow me to participate except
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
not to vote but I'm investigating right
 
02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
at the moment that's fine if you have to
 
02:48:54.830 --> 02:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
go that's fine it's understand but I do
 
02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
have some questions when you when you're
 
02:49:02.590 --> 02:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
um so I guess one kind of general
 
02:49:07.389 --> 02:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
question is you know what what's the
 
02:49:10.670 --> 02:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
reason for removing the collaboration um
 
02:49:13.630 --> 02:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
is it not working um whatever if you
 
02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
could address that General area good
 
02:49:17.950 --> 02:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
morning I'm Sarah Lesley I know David
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
already introduced me but I'm the vice
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
president and the legislative co-chair
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Society Pas and
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
I've been a PA for the past 14 years so
 
02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
to answer the question you just asked
 
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
when we passed sorry go ahead I couldn't
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
hear you I apologize yeah can you hear
 
02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
me now yeah better you have to be pretty
 
02:49:38.349 --> 02:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
close to the mic Perfect all right so um
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
since we passed s228 two years ago we
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
thought that that was going to clear up
 
02:49:43.990 --> 02:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of our issues because what we've
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
been finding is that uh employers and
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians don't want didn't want to
 
02:49:49.950 --> 02:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
sign the supervising agreements because
 
02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
of financial burden as well as
 
02:49:54.429 --> 02:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
administrative burden um and liability
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
so we thought great we passed s228 it's
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
collaboration The Physician is no longer
 
02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
liable for signing that uh agreement um
 
02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
great however what's happened in the
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
last two years is not a lot has changed
 
02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
there's still Physicians that don't want
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
to sign up because we still actually
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
have to provide medical malpractice for
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
that physician um because they can still
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
be sued by signing it however they us
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
they'll fall off eventually but I still
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
have to provide coverage for that
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
physician and so do the hospitals um in
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
order for them to sign that form now we
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
still also have Physicians that don't
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
want to sign so they have Pas that are
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
not being hired uh we heard from the
 
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
chair at this at Southern um Southern
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Health the chair for the
 
02:50:36.910 --> 02:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
family practice Division and they used
 
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
to have Pas and they've had to let go of
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of their seasoned Pas in in order
 
02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
to hire new grad NPS because they've
 
02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
lost the docks and they will not signed
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
the collaboration agreement so now
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're down to only four Pas and all
 
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
new grad NPS so they've lost a lot of
 
02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
their experienced help and what was that
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
organ that was the department chair of
 
02:50:56.830 --> 02:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh Southern New Hampshire health for
 
02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:57.750 align:start position:0%
uh Southern New Hampshire health for
family

02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:51:00.269 --> 02:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
practice so they have 36 providers and
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
now they only have four Pas when it used
 
02:51:04.229 --> 02:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
to be Physicians and PAs and now they
 
02:51:07.229 --> 02:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
only have NPS because and newr NPS
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to sign the form
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
so we thought that changing it so the
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
doc was not liable for signing the form
 
02:51:14.110 --> 02:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
we thought that making it so it wasn't a
 
02:51:16.110 --> 02:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor form would have solved this
 
02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
but it literally changed nothing so
 
02:51:21.790 --> 02:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we're also back here
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
supporting this today because this is
 
02:51:25.630 --> 02:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately we want parody with The NPS
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
because our training is if you look at
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
our clinical hours in school it's three
 
02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
times that what a nurse practitioner
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
gets I'm a PA my brother's an
 
02:51:34.030 --> 02:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
Interventional cardiologist my sister's
 
02:51:35.469 --> 02:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
a nurse practitioner so we kind of got a
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of everything and even my
 
02:51:39.229 --> 02:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
sister when if she said if it wasn't for
 
02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
my brother and myself she's like my
 
02:51:42.670 --> 02:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
training was nothing like what you had
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
because it's part-time online compared
 
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
to our full-time
 
02:51:50.110 --> 02:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
iners medical it's our PA programs are
 
02:51:52.349 --> 02:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
designed after Medical School whereas
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
nursy practitioners are designed after
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
the nursing model and unfortunately you
 
02:51:58.030 --> 02:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
know now you don't even have to be a
 
02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
nurse to go into NP school there are
 
02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
programs such as Simmons that have
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
direct NP programs where you go in you
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
get your RN and NP at the same time with
 
02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
very limited clinical hours and I've
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
heard some say well you know NPS are
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
better you know in the sense they they
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
should have independent practice I hate
 
02:52:15.550 --> 02:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
saying that autonomous practice because
 
02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
none of us practice independently we're
 
02:52:19.150 --> 02:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
always leaning on each other doc PA I
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
have docs that come to me and ask me
 
02:52:21.750 --> 02:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions because they know I'm better
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
at some things than they are and I ask
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
them questions that's just the way it
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
works um but you know with NP programs
 
02:52:31.510 --> 02:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
they say opas are generalized you know
 
02:52:32.750 --> 02:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
we're trained in all different areas of
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
medicine NPS are trained in one specific
 
02:52:37.469 --> 02:52:37.479 align:start position:0%
area but now what we're finding is that
 
02:52:38.990 --> 02:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
Family Practice NPS are hired and
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
they're put in the ICU instead of being
 
02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
the ICU the adult Critical Care NP
 
02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
programs that are supposed to be working
 
02:52:46.190 --> 02:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
in the ICU so that's not even a valid
 
02:52:50.269 --> 02:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
argument anymore um but so ultimately
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's why we're back here because 228
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
what we thought it was going to do did
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
not change anything at
 
02:53:00.110 --> 02:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
all okay
 
02:53:03.389 --> 02:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
um trying to get some notes here
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
so okay so you for one question is
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning NP I also there's the
 
02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:10.750 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning NP I also there's the
term

02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
um APRN what's the relation yes yes crnp
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
npnp they're all the same they just have
 
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
different acronyms all right uh qu uh
 
02:53:23.510 --> 02:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
represent MTI thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you said
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
that collaboration really that did not
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
happen or that did not change the
 
02:53:37.349 --> 02:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
liability or malpractice so if uh the
 
02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
the Physicians still carry that what
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
happens when that decouples will the Pas
 
02:53:46.269 --> 02:53:46.279 align:start position:0%
need to take a higher malpractice or
 
02:53:49.550 --> 02:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
liability insurance at that time perfect
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the question um no
 
02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
so we carry the same liability as the
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians right now as it is um however
 
02:54:00.510 --> 02:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
what we have to do is especially pasas
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
that own their own practice they have to
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
still provide coverage for their medical
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
director um so what ends up happening is
 
02:54:09.990 --> 02:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
now I still even though it's not liable
 
02:54:11.710 --> 02:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
it says in statute the physician's not
 
02:54:13.750 --> 02:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
liable for signing that form we still
 
02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay extra to provide that
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
malpractice but we still carry the same
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
malpractice coverage that the Physicians
 
02:54:21.389 --> 02:54:21.399 align:start position:0%
do and we always have so we've always
 
02:54:23.229 --> 02:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
had our own and Physicians have their
 
02:54:26.349 --> 02:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
own it's it stays the same follow up
 
02:54:30.150 --> 02:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um with the
 
02:54:34.269 --> 02:54:34.279 align:start position:0%
malpractice it also has the or
 
02:54:36.670 --> 02:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
organization that you work for except
 
02:54:38.710 --> 02:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
when you have a private practice or
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
independent practice they also carry
 
02:54:45.550 --> 02:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
liability for the practicing Physicians
 
02:54:48.150 --> 02:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
or PA correct mhm and that's still a
 
02:54:51.389 --> 02:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
practice yes this that won't change yes
 
02:54:54.229 --> 02:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so like I work at Clear Choice MD
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
um in addition to having my own um
 
02:54:58.830 --> 02:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
practice and they I get malpractice
 
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
through Clear Choice MD and I also
 
02:55:02.429 --> 02:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
happen to buy my own because I don't
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
trust their malpractice to cover me
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
fully which I think a lot of providers
 
02:55:07.950 --> 02:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
understand is a smart thing to do so
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
just to be clear um you said the Pas
 
02:55:14.510 --> 02:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
have the same liability uh insurance as
 
02:55:18.269 --> 02:55:18.279 align:start position:0%
a as an MD is it typically cost about
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
the same I know there can be differences
 
02:55:22.510 --> 02:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
in Specialties for MDS but right so
 
02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's hard to say because I honestly I
 
02:55:25.750 --> 02:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how much everybody is paying
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
so I I can't say for sure I do know that
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
U premiums have gone up because of the
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
extreme judgments have have been coming
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
these 15 million $20 million judgments
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
so all the providers are seeing an
 
02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
increase in our premiums um it could be
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
that the docs have to pay more but we
 
02:55:42.269 --> 02:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
still have the same the 1 mil 3 mil
 
02:55:44.670 --> 02:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
coverage that the Physicians also carry
 
02:55:46.349 --> 02:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
some practices or Specialties may have
 
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
to carry more depending okay so kind of
 
02:55:52.590 --> 02:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
a followup to that so do you uh
 
02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate any change in the cost of the
 
02:55:58.070 --> 02:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
insurance Pas if the collaboration
 
02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
agreement requirement goes away well
 
02:56:02.229 --> 02:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
without being an insurance company I
 
02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
can't say for sure but my from what I
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
understand probably not other than the
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
fact that they're all just going up
 
02:56:10.030 --> 02:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of what's been
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
happening with um massive payouts okay
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
for Leslie um I I'll get to you
 
02:56:19.830 --> 02:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gould mapy and then
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt uh just very
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you um Mr chair and thank
 
02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in your
 
02:56:28.429 --> 02:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
testimony you talked about um you
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
compared a little bit nurse
 
02:56:33.389 --> 02:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
practitioners and physicians assistant
 
02:56:35.429 --> 02:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
my daughter I was trying to look up her
 
02:56:37.590 --> 02:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
exact acronyms I'm dyslexic I'll say
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
them all wrong but she has her doctors
 
02:56:42.429 --> 02:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
as a nurse practitioner and she um
 
02:56:45.670 --> 02:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
develops palea care Care Pediatric padic
 
02:56:49.389 --> 02:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
Care programs um in Hawaii and North
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
Carolina she is now at any rate we had a
 
02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
lengthy conversation about this and
 
02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
would you agree that basically seven
 
02:57:02.110 --> 02:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
years out in practice a PA and an and an
 
02:57:05.349 --> 02:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
advanced whatever nurse
 
02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
practioner um I really performing equal
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
work that there's differences on both
 
02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
sides I mean I can read you what she
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
said she would say the act opposite of
 
02:57:17.229 --> 02:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
what you said that blah blah blah
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
physician assistants can have any
 
02:57:20.229 --> 02:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
undergraduate degree we had to have a
 
02:57:21.630 --> 02:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
Nursing degree I mean so there's
 
02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
differences there subtle differences in
 
02:57:27.229 --> 02:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day would you
 
02:57:27.239 --> 02:57:28.349 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day would you
agree

02:57:28.349 --> 02:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:57:31.229 --> 02:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
that a physician's assistant is looking
 
02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
at a more medical model curing disease a
 
02:57:36.510 --> 02:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner looks more at a
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
nursing taking care of the family but
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
both are practicing prescrib the scope
 
02:57:45.550 --> 02:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
of services ultimately are the same yes
 
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you for the question yes it
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
is 100% they are the same um especially
 
02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
once you've had time and you've been
 
02:57:54.510 --> 02:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
practicing um I would say that we can't
 
02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
have any degree to go into PA program
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
because we actually have to have either
 
02:57:58.990 --> 02:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
Premed or something like that because
 
02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of prere in everything I
 
02:58:02.269 --> 02:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
understand and I know there's going to
 
02:58:03.790 --> 02:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
be those um but to answer your question
 
02:58:05.469 --> 02:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
though yes you know especially when you
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
have um experienced practitioners yes
 
02:58:09.790 --> 02:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of studies that show
 
02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
there's no bad outcomes whether it's an
 
02:58:15.070 --> 02:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
NP or a pa um so nothing to put my NPS
 
02:58:16.229 --> 02:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
down because again my sister would kill
 
02:58:19.070 --> 02:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
me um and I I love The NPS that I work
 
02:58:21.269 --> 02:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
with it's there's nothing against them
 
02:58:22.870 --> 02:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's merely just looking at the facts of
 
02:58:26.590 --> 02:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
Education followup follow up and so U my
 
02:58:28.229 --> 02:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
daughter also said at the end of the day
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
she would hire a PA over a over an NP
 
02:58:34.910 --> 02:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
who was more qualified and anyway she
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
loves P her Pas and so my my question is
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and I had to make a note of it here
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
because I'm so horrible with your
 
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
medical term terminology she is in North
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
Carolina which is a collaborative
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
Practice State so she as a nurse
 
02:58:53.550 --> 02:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner just like the Pas in North
 
02:58:56.830 --> 02:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
Carolina are under whatever lordship of
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
whatever God that yeah in New Hampshire
 
02:59:03.070 --> 02:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
the nurse practitioners are independent
 
02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
currently but the Pas are are under this
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
collaborative type of practice so it's
 
02:59:11.110 --> 02:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
almost like we have a schizophrenia
 
02:59:12.990 --> 02:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
going on where we have two professions
 
02:59:16.229 --> 02:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
that have an equal scope of practice but
 
02:59:18.670 --> 02:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
they're treated differently because of
 
02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:19.870 align:start position:0%
they're treated differently because of
this

02:59:19.870 --> 02:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:59:22.349 --> 02:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
collaborative yes would you agree yes
 
02:59:23.830 --> 02:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
and essentially what ends what's ended
 
02:59:26.190 --> 02:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
up happening is that nurse practitioners
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
have a better lobbying group than Pas so
 
02:59:31.110 --> 02:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
26 I think 26 if not more states have
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
passed independent practice and again I
 
02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
hate that word um for nurse
 
02:59:36.510 --> 02:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners and only six states have
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
passed it for Pas because it only became
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
a big initiative um for our very small
 
02:59:43.389 --> 02:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
state groups to start moving this
 
02:59:45.469 --> 02:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
forward with in the last about six seven
 
02:59:47.469 --> 02:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
years so it's only just started and
 
02:59:48.910 --> 02:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's why you only see so many it's not
 
02:59:50.830 --> 02:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
because the states are oh no this is bad
 
02:59:52.990 --> 02:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
it's because it just started and we
 
02:59:54.269 --> 02:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
literally like our group for the new
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
hire soci of Pas we have 10 Pas on the
 
02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
board so we all volunteer we a lot of us
 
03:00:01.630 --> 03:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
have multiple jobs um and it is
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic because yes many states
 
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
are different but they're all moving
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
towards the same thing and they all
 
03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
should um but it's just Pas are a little
 
03:00:10.590 --> 03:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
slower because we have less money and
 
03:00:14.910 --> 03:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying power than the nurses do ENT
 
03:00:18.990 --> 03:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um to continue on the
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
malpractice and
 
03:00:23.469 --> 03:00:23.479 align:start position:0%
affordability if I remember well when
 
03:00:26.670 --> 03:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
Pas initially started it was more cost
 
03:00:30.910 --> 03:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
effective to provide physician services
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
at a lower cost because the education
 
03:00:37.950 --> 03:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
was less all that and by making it you
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
know carry your own insurance
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
malpractice all that would that become
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
more uh costly for PAs to practice and
 
03:00:50.750 --> 03:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
that in turn change the availability um
 
03:00:52.389 --> 03:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
no because we we already carry our own
 
03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
malpractice so that's already happening
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
in order for us to practice we've always
 
03:00:58.030 --> 03:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
had to carry our own malpractice it's
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
just this if they take this away we no
 
03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
longer have to pay cover the physician
 
03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
as well so if anything it actually might
 
03:01:05.550 --> 03:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
lessen it and there was also and thank
 
03:01:06.990 --> 03:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
you so much for bringing this up there
 
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
was a a good article that was just um
 
03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
put in the apologize let me the medic
 
03:01:15.150 --> 03:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
out practice payment reports for
 
03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
physician assistance and it actually was
 
03:01:18.510 --> 03:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the states that are removing
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
barriers for PA practice so moving to
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration and autonomous practice
 
03:01:24.469 --> 03:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
and this was posted in the uh Federation
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
of State Medical boards or the Journal
 
03:01:28.229 --> 03:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
of medical regulation and it showed that
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
there was no increase in payouts for
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
removing you know going more to
 
03:01:35.269 --> 03:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
autonomous practice for Pas or NPS can
 
03:01:37.229 --> 03:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
you send the uh committee email the
 
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
email the committee a absolutely copy of
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
it and if you have paper ones I do I
 
03:01:42.309 --> 03:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
have it right here great happy to give
 
03:01:44.349 --> 03:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
it to you I'm sor did that answer your
 
03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
question yes okay thank you representer
 
03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank thank you Mr chairman
 
03:01:57.070 --> 03:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
so um I I'm almost 86 years old I I had
 
03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
a quadruple bypass operation about 15
 
03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
years ago and the first person I saw
 
03:02:06.349 --> 03:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
after I came out of the anesthesia was
 
03:02:06.359 --> 03:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
after I came out of the anesthesia was
uh

03:02:07.190 --> 03:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
PA I think that was my first interaction
 
03:02:15.469 --> 03:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
with a PA 15 or 16 years ago also had a
 
03:02:15.479 --> 03:02:16.550 align:start position:0%
with a PA 15 or 16 years ago also had a
kidney

03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
kidney
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
stone I'm sitting in the emergency room
 
03:02:21.670 --> 03:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
in at went with Douglas there's a sign
 
03:02:24.269 --> 03:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
on the wall it says you may request to
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
see a physician at any time I'm going
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
like what the hell am I in here for if
 
03:02:31.870 --> 03:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be seeing a doctor so a
 
03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
few minutes later in comes somebody who
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
looked like a doctor to me he got the
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis 100% correct uh everything he
 
03:02:42.990 --> 03:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
said was exactly right and the way that
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
I was treated it was a I had a CAT scan
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't show the
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
stone they didn't do MRIs on the weekend
 
03:02:54.269 --> 03:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
in those days so I was kept overnight
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
and the next morning Monday morning they
 
03:03:00.269 --> 03:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
did an MRI and saw the stone okay so I
 
03:03:03.510 --> 03:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
got the perfect treatment from from the
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
NP who was the did the kidney
 
03:03:12.110 --> 03:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
stone the the the quadruple bypass I was
 
03:03:16.510 --> 03:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
seen by a PA not by my operator uh and
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
so forth on a quadruple bypass you think
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
that they want to have first class
 
03:03:25.550 --> 03:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
medical treatment right so for me my
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
experience has been that these people
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing and both one of
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
them was the the PA was at Portsmouth
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Regional the NP was at with Douglas okay
 
03:03:39.870 --> 03:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
but the point is they were both hired by
 
03:03:44.349 --> 03:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
high class well rep reputable Hospital
 
03:03:47.429 --> 03:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
so for me the treatment seems to be
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
exactly the same that I'm being seen by
 
03:03:54.750 --> 03:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
competently trained individuals so I'm I
 
03:03:59.710 --> 03:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
tend to see Pas as equal to doctors NPS
 
03:04:02.269 --> 03:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
as equal to doctors depending on what
 
03:04:06.269 --> 03:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing so your testimony has been
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
very enlightening to me in terms of what
 
03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
the Practical reality is but the
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
question is uh because in many cases the
 
03:04:17.229 --> 03:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
doctors are also specializing they're
 
03:04:19.870 --> 03:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're having you seen by somebody
 
03:04:22.349 --> 03:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
who's a specialist in that area and
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
you're not all doing
 
03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
everything so can you comment on uh that
 
03:04:31.389 --> 03:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
aspect because to the degree that you're
 
03:04:33.389 --> 03:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
do that you have more
 
03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
training uh and the the only real
 
03:04:39.630 --> 03:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
difference is that you got this tether
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
as Dave quasi says okay if that's the
 
03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
only difference
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
seems to me like we ought to get rid of
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
that difference but can you comment on
 
03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
some of the aspects that I've raised not
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
my no absolutely and I think one to to
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
answer your question a good thing to
 
03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
point out here Pas a lot are in the
 
03:04:59.309 --> 03:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
surgical Specialties because it's the
 
03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
one place that The NPS haven't taken
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
over and haven't pushed us out of um and
 
03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
again I love NPS and this is not I don't
 
03:05:07.070 --> 03:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
want this turn into an NP War because
 
03:05:09.150 --> 03:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's not the case but when you're in a
 
03:05:12.429 --> 03:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
surgical sub specialty um you're always
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a physician there's going
 
03:05:15.950 --> 03:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
to be Pas in the operating room alone
 
03:05:17.070 --> 03:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
doing these things you're always going
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
to have the physician in those
 
03:05:20.670 --> 03:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
Specialties but yes it's merely just
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
removing that piece of paper I pay
 
03:05:26.110 --> 03:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a month for my collaboration
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
agreement for a doct that I've never met
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
and he'll never be in my practice and
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
he's not the person I ask questions I
 
03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
ask my colleagues I ask the person that
 
03:05:36.190 --> 03:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
trained me for injectables I talk to her
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
if I have questions I talk to other NPS
 
03:05:40.910 --> 03:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
that or PAs or docs whoever it may be
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
like for my lasers and whatnot if I have
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions or always reaching out we
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
always collaborate we always do that
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
nobody practices independently but
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
especially in the O their pa will come
 
03:05:51.389 --> 03:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
see you and I it's kind of bad if the
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
surgeon didn't come see you after I kind
 
03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
of I'm sorry for that
 
03:05:59.150 --> 03:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
um that's possible um but no so like
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're this isn't going to be a sudden
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
shift where all suddenly Pas are opening
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
up all their practices because if that
 
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
were the case why are there not tons of
 
03:06:06.630 --> 03:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
NP owned practices all over the place
 
03:06:07.870 --> 03:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
with no Physicians because that didn't
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
happen in the last 20 years but Pas and
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
NPS we work the same we work as part of
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
the team we all collaborate we don't
 
03:06:17.950 --> 03:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
need a piece of paper to say that we're
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to ask a question then why anybody
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
would think that ethically Pas would not
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
reach out when they have a question when
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
that question is not asked of any other
 
03:06:28.269 --> 03:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
provider physician or NP
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
is quite mind-boggling to me um because
 
03:06:33.229 --> 03:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
we will do that we will continue to do
 
03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to suddenly change
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
how we practice and in the surgery we'll
 
03:06:38.349 --> 03:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
always have a physician there I mean
 
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
we're never practicing alone and I know
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
one argument too has been brought up
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
that PA some somehow prescribe more
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
opiates than other providers but if you
 
03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
think about the surgical sub um
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
Specialties the doc does a surgery the
 
03:06:52.269 --> 03:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
PA is doing the discharge the PA is
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
writing all the opiates for the patient
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
posttop so of course our prescriptions
 
03:06:58.830 --> 03:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit more sometimes
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
because the doc is never writing them so
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
that also is another argument that is
 
03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
invalid um but I did that answer your
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
question I mean really npsp we all
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
team the more you talk about what you
 
03:07:16.229 --> 03:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
are doing what the NPS are doing and so
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
forth and what the docs are doing uh the
 
03:07:21.309 --> 03:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
more we understand and can make a
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
intelligent decision on this Bill Brown
 
03:07:27.070 --> 03:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
oh Sor I
 
03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you Mr chair uh thanks
 
03:07:32.910 --> 03:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if this passes
 
03:07:34.830 --> 03:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
you won't have to pay $1,000 a month
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
anymore for a collaborative agreement I
 
03:07:38.670 --> 03:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
would not accurate and it also wouldn't
 
03:07:40.030 --> 03:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay them Mal practice for the
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
doctor that is never providing care in
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%

Rockingham District 31 I'm one of the
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of bill um I as I've
 
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
listened to the testimony the two
 
03:08:45.389 --> 03:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
previous people uh having been around
 
03:08:47.309 --> 03:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
the physician assistant career now
 
03:08:49.870 --> 03:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
literally for 50 years because my dad
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
started the program at the University of
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
Nebraska Medical Center there's a little
 
03:08:58.389 --> 03:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
bit of a feeling in the way the tone of
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is going a little bit of an Oliver
 
03:09:03.110 --> 03:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
Twist thing right like kind of a
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
pathetic ragam muffin saying please may
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
I have another and I would just like to
 
03:09:12.030 --> 03:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
stand up and say the physician assistant
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
career is a proud and capable and
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
extremely well-trained and experienced
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
career they're they're an equivalent
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
they're not equal they're equivalent to
 
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners nurse practitioners
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
do not need these collaborative
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
agreements this is an unnecessary
 
03:09:31.630 --> 03:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that adds costs
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
and administrative overhead and I really
 
03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if you would
 
03:09:38.790 --> 03:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
favorably consider this bill and and
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
with that if there are no questions I'll
 
03:09:43.790 --> 03:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
go to Ways and Means anyone in the
 
03:09:45.790 --> 03:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
committee represent MTI briefly because
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
I know he's got to run I know I know you
 
03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
have to run um with the physician
 
03:09:54.269 --> 03:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
assistant this collaborative thing is it
 
03:09:57.630 --> 03:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar to the medical student
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
or residency that they have the
 
03:10:03.550 --> 03:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
attendance overseeing and that doesn't
 
03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
sever after that residency is done I
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
mean in doctors that is severed that's
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
done they become independent in PA that
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
last a lifetime can does that make sense
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I think
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question of interest and it
 
03:10:22.750 --> 03:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's getting into the detail that's
 
03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
important to you but I would just pop
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
back up and say what this bill is trying
 
03:10:30.110 --> 03:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
to do it's trying to create an an
 
03:10:32.269 --> 03:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
equivalence between nurse practitioners
 
03:10:34.229 --> 03:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
and PAs because they're on the same
 
03:10:36.630 --> 03:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
professional standard I don't know about
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
the internship and all those other
 
03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
agreements but miss Leslie apparently
 
03:10:43.630 --> 03:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
has an example of her collaborative
 
03:10:45.309 --> 03:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
agreement I'm sure she would share that
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
with you okay thank you and uh release
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
you to ways and
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
means you're going to try not to spend
 
03:10:55.630 --> 03:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
your money uh no I thought your job was
 
03:10:58.469 --> 03:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
to bring it in and finance to spend it
 
03:11:01.150 --> 03:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
that's right uh you have something
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
up I I just wanted to remind the
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh Representatives Ro
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
and um Edwards did bring an amendment to
 
03:11:19.590 --> 03:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
the committee and and I think that is a
 
03:11:21.429 --> 03:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
that really does a better job of
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying the intent of the legislation
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure that was
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the record that that that they did
 
03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
bring that and um that we think makes it
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
a lot clearer um that was sent it was
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
sent out to the committee do you have
 
03:11:35.910 --> 03:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
any extra copies of that amendment I I
 
03:11:37.790 --> 03:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
have a yeah I if it's okay I have the
 
03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
the original Bill stapled to the
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
amendment if that's okay that's fine um
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:52.110 --> 03:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.750 --> 03:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay does anybody who's on the
 
03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee need any other questions
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
answered before we move what I was gonna
 
03:12:03.229 --> 03:12:03.239 align:start position:0%

03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
yep good afternoon I'm happy to do my
 
03:13:03.070 --> 03:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
best I will say uh I love to see how
 
03:13:04.910 --> 03:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
much support Dave's got today from the
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
PA friends here we I did have a provider
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
That was supposed to come with me this
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
morning to the subcommittee to be able
 
03:13:13.830 --> 03:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
to answer questions as a provider um but
 
03:13:15.389 --> 03:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
if it isn't something I can answer I I
 
03:13:16.710 --> 03:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
can get the committee an answer and I
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
just want to say too the reason I didn't
 
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
feel it was necessary for me to take
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
even more time of the subcommittee is uh
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
my the medical society's position has
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
not changed since we uh submitted Our
 
03:13:28.349 --> 03:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
Testimony at the public hearing but I
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make myself available here for
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh and chairwoman McGuire
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
requested it so I'm here so much quick
 
03:13:40.349 --> 03:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
question in terms of the main opposition
 
03:13:43.150 --> 03:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
from AMA is the
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
education level and they still need PA
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
still need the supervision am I correct
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I I don't feel I could speak for the
 
03:13:52.830 --> 03:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
AMA so the that's the American Medical
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
Association so in my testimony I
 
03:13:57.710 --> 03:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
referenced a recent article released by
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
the AMA going off the top of my head
 
03:14:01.870 --> 03:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
here so I'll do my best in December of
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
2023 that quoted um the national
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
leadership of the accrediting
 
03:14:11.190 --> 03:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
educational or entity for Pas um that
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
spoke to the fact that the the
 
03:14:14.670 --> 03:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum that that is set forth for
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
them does not is not catered in a way
 
03:14:19.229 --> 03:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
that seeks for them to I know we've
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
heard that this word is uncomfortable
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
for some people but I'm going to say it
 
03:14:24.510 --> 03:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
because that was what was quoted for PAs
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
to independently practice so I was
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
quoting the AMA in that sense but I can
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
speak on the H behalf of the medical
 
03:14:33.389 --> 03:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
society as yes what was submitted in our
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and if it's helpful to the
 
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for their work today I can
 
03:14:37.910 --> 03:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
recirculated in an email so you have it
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
in front of you if you don't have it
 
03:14:41.229 --> 03:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
physically with you today is that there
 
03:14:44.510 --> 03:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
are concerns you know we the we as in
 
03:14:47.710 --> 03:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
the society and its members value the
 
03:14:50.269 --> 03:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
collaborative team and again I know it's
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
bit conflicting of what you heard
 
03:14:53.630 --> 03:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
earlier and what I'm saying now but the
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
collaborative team that Physicians have
 
03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
with Pas and NPS and the medical team
 
03:15:01.630 --> 03:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
that works to provide care in our state
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
they value it they respect it and I want
 
03:15:06.429 --> 03:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's very clear to your
 
03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
question similar to my testimony some of
 
03:15:10.590 --> 03:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
the biggest concerns is the lack of
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
Education and Training uh the lack of
 
03:15:14.750 --> 03:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
oversight that we currently have or the
 
03:15:16.349 --> 03:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say oversight I should say
 
03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
the ability for Pas due to their lack of
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
educational training internships Etc
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
residency to consult with a physician um
 
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I have some examples that after
 
03:15:28.590 --> 03:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
hearing some of the commentary earlier
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
that I'll supply to the subcommittee or
 
03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
or the committee at large whichever the
 
03:15:33.550 --> 03:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
chairman prefers that speaks to
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
instances where I know of Physicians who
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
do in fact collaborate on a consistent
 
03:15:40.030 --> 03:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
basis with Pas and I'm sorry to hear
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
that that's not the case for some folks
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the audience today um but yeah did
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative and if not we'll keep
 
03:15:50.590 --> 03:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
we'll keep working at it follow up for
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
that so in order for the physician to be
 
03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
in collaboration collaborative agreement
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
the Pas are carrying their malpractice
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so that is to me does not feel I'll
 
03:16:07.229 --> 03:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
need to get some clarity on that because
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
I as a previous speaker said I'm not an
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
employee of the insurance department and
 
03:16:12.910 --> 03:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from Department in the
 
03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
audience could speak more eloquently to
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the statute that governs the level of
 
03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
liability that Physicians and PAs or you
 
03:16:23.710 --> 03:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
know and and what governs that
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement if there's a
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
floor um I I would need to get more I'm
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
not an expert on how that would impact
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
the premiums or the current requirement
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I understand that some folks
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
previously testified that some choose to
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
carry their own out of protection for
 
03:16:40.990 --> 03:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
themselves um but I I'm not an expert on
 
03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
that I would need to get back to the
 
03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:42.790 align:start position:0%
that I would need to get back to the
committee

03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the question I'm looking for
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
um the answered uh M we heard some on
 
03:16:49.229 --> 03:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
the insurance earlier I don't know if
 
03:16:53.950 --> 03:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
there's any no it just felt like the
 
03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
Physicians who are collaborating are
 
03:16:59.229 --> 03:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
getting paid to be a collaborative
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor plus their insurance so the
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
burden of additional cost is on PA not
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the physician so just doesn't
 
03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
seem fair that's all
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to insist very briefly because
 
03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
we got another big Bill repres Schmidt
 
03:17:20.269 --> 03:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so the question I think
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's before us is not whether there's
 
03:17:24.750 --> 03:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
collaboration going on I think that's
 
03:17:26.510 --> 03:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious and it was referenced by
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
Miss Leslie the question is whether
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's supervision going on uh which
 
03:17:34.510 --> 03:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be the case that it's not that
 
03:17:36.870 --> 03:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
they they're connected by that tether
 
03:17:39.150 --> 03:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
but uh it's not really they're not being
 
03:17:41.229 --> 03:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
supervised she say she never sees them
 
03:17:43.590 --> 03:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
if I can inter for a moment um Senate
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 228 which I reviewed before this
 
03:17:48.670 --> 03:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
explicitly removed the supervision
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
requirement yeah right so that's I was
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
exactly going to say that Mr chair I
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
think Dave my friend Dave czy um
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
eloquently spoke to the history that
 
03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
resulted from the passage of Senate Bill
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
228 uh and yes I think between the
 
03:18:07.710 --> 03:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and Dave kzy he answered your
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
question representative Schmidt that it
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
is a collaborative model and again I I'm
 
03:18:15.309 --> 03:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
not denying or or I I completely accept
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
and receive what some of the testimony
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
has been this morning that there are
 
03:18:21.070 --> 03:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
instances where Pas uh feel that they
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
have been in situations that they did
 
03:18:25.309 --> 03:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
not have an actual physician
 
03:18:28.510 --> 03:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
collaborating with them however I I you
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
know I have data and information from
 
03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
our providers when I heard this at our
 
03:18:33.790 --> 03:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
you know in previous conversations and
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
today that suggested that there are
 
03:18:37.670 --> 03:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
providers who do collaborate in that way
 
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you oh represent Brown
 
03:18:42.630 --> 03:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
I'll try to keep this short Mr Mr chair
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so my apologies to the rest of
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and to all of you who
 
03:18:48.510 --> 03:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
probably know more about this than I do
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't on this committee until
 
03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:51.710 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't on this committee until
recently

03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
recently
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
so if you remove
 
03:18:54.720 --> 03:18:56.349 align:start position:0%
so if you remove
collaboration

03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
agreement let me back up a little
 
03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
bit if I go to see a PA a physician's
 
03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
assistant and I'm in in in the office
 
03:19:07.070 --> 03:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking there is a physician
 
03:19:08.910 --> 03:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
associated with this person that's
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
guiding this person or helping them out
 
03:19:14.349 --> 03:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
if we remove collaboration agreement and
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's worded
 
03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
differently am I wrong in thinking that
 
03:19:19.710 --> 03:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
now should that not be called a
 
03:19:22.269 --> 03:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
physician assistant or am I just there
 
03:19:24.550 --> 03:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
so they're no they're if they're
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
autonomous they don't have a physician
 
03:19:30.269 --> 03:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
assisting them or because that it is I
 
03:19:31.469 --> 03:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
guess that's a whole different topic
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
whether this name is relevant anymore I
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best to navigate that um
 
03:19:40.030 --> 03:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative I think I I want to
 
03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
respect the comments that were shared
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
this morning that there people have had
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
experiences where they did not have a
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
physician to collaborate with but there
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
are instances I'd like to make a
 
03:19:52.110 --> 03:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
correction okay that was not what was
 
03:19:54.389 --> 03:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
stated okay what was stated was that the
 
03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
physician who signed their collaboration
 
03:19:58.510 --> 03:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
agreement they did not interact with but
 
03:20:00.910 --> 03:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
they regularly collaborated with other
 
03:20:02.429 --> 03:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
members of the medical team including
 
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians and those are two very
 
03:20:05.429 --> 03:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
different things thank you for the
 
03:20:08.590 --> 03:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
correction so as far as when there's a
 
03:20:12.229 --> 03:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
agreements with Pas and the physician is
 
03:20:14.790 --> 03:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be their Chief collaborator
 
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
I know of instances where that does take
 
03:20:20.030 --> 03:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
place um and it does take place so you
 
03:20:22.229 --> 03:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
know as far as the title I don't feel
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
like I would be the person to decide
 
03:20:25.469 --> 03:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not physician assistant is
 
03:20:27.189 --> 03:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
still relevant I'm of the mind that that
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
reflects the current relationship that
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
exists all right thank you yeah all set
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
um so what I'd like to do uh if people
 
03:20:37.950 --> 03:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
in the uh subcommittee are comfortable
 
03:20:42.910 --> 03:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
with it would be moved to um
 
03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
no well no we don't do that this not a
 
03:20:47.790 --> 03:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing we don't have to do that
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh no to uh I I'd like a motion this is
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:20:53.399 --> 03:20:55.870 align:start position:0%
for the
amendment

03:20:55.870 --> 03:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I move that we that the um
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee vote ought to pass on
 
03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0454 H yep okay and do have a
 
03:21:13.309 --> 03:21:13.319 align:start position:0%

03:21:15.269 --> 03:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
right all right do we need any
 
03:21:17.550 --> 03:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
discussion before voting on the
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments don't see any all right um
 
03:21:25.630 --> 03:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
all in favor I anyone opposed okay thank
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
you and then another motion I I move
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we ought to pass um House Bill
 
03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:35.790 align:start position:0%
that we ought to pass um House Bill
122

03:21:35.790 --> 03:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
122
 
03:21:39.870 --> 03:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
1222 amended a and with Amendment amend
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
I want to get that one right I was
 
03:21:41.560 --> 03:21:43.710 align:start position:0%
I want to get that one right I was
waiting

03:21:43.710 --> 03:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that's another
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
second okay may all in
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
favor can can I ask put a quick question
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
on okay um I'm just concerned that we do
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
not create a rift between the physician
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the physician assistant if there
 
03:22:07.710 --> 03:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to a rift
 
03:22:11.309 --> 03:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
um that I I think we have evidence that
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
they do tend to work together this is
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
specifically whether somebody has to
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
sign the collaboration agreement and I
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
would hope they would they would behave
 
03:22:20.910 --> 03:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
professionally and continue
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
collaborating as they have separate from
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
the whole collaboration agreement issue
 
03:22:29.229 --> 03:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
because the only two Mr chair the only
 
03:22:31.830 --> 03:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
two opposition was American Medical
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
Association and one of the Physicians so
 
03:22:37.510 --> 03:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
they are the collaborators and they are
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
the team members those are the organiz I
 
03:22:42.750 --> 03:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know anyway
 
03:22:46.110 --> 03:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
right okay uh anything else any other
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
discussion okay all in favor on the
 
03:22:53.309 --> 03:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
motion is um ought to pass with uh with
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment on HP 1221 22 22 thank you um
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
all in favor I I anyone opposed I I
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
oppose for this particular reason I
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
didn't get my clarification in terms of
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
who's getting the Li
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
why is that and that was answer um can
 
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
we get a we'll we'll uh say we can hold
 
03:23:19.389 --> 03:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
off on the vote and see if we can get an
 
03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
answer to your issue we not to be quite
 
03:23:25.189 --> 03:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
as formal in here as the exact
 
03:23:27.150 --> 03:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
session all right thank you for the
 
03:23:29.309 --> 03:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
Indulgence Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:23:32.269 --> 03:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
the question uh in terms of liability I
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
want to make one important Point as part
 
03:23:39.070 --> 03:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 228 Pas became the only
 
03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
provider in New Hampshire that is is by
 
03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
law required to carry malpractice
 
03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
insurance no other provider is required
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
by law to carry malpractice insurance
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
including The NPS and this is about NPS
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
and PAs and parity there it's not about
 
03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
parity between docs and PAs so I I so
 
03:24:03.670 --> 03:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure why we're you know
 
03:24:05.790 --> 03:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
frankly it's a it's not a doc
 
03:24:09.309 --> 03:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
conversation um the the instance I think
 
03:24:10.990 --> 03:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
that you're referencing uh
 
03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:12.550 align:start position:0%
that you're referencing uh
representative

03:24:12.550 --> 03:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
is Miss Leslie for example because of
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
while she's employed she has her own
 
03:24:21.389 --> 03:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
practice she has to carry as the
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
condition of this physician car signing
 
03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
that collaboration agreement that piece
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
of paper that's the tether it's the
 
03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
signature on the piece of paper um she
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
has to carry
 
03:24:36.309 --> 03:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
his he said he or she I don't know if I
 
03:24:39.150 --> 03:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
could clear sorry I just let me
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt briefly so as I understood it
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
and you can tell me if this is right or
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
not that although Senate Bill
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
228 removed that official liability the
 
03:24:51.070 --> 03:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies still May or or
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
whoever gets sued in the courts may see
 
03:24:55.830 --> 03:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
a liability and so in effect the PA
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
still have to cover some liability for
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
their collaborative uh MD even though
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the legislator's intent yes
 
03:25:08.110 --> 03:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
but if I may Mr chair y in the instance
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
with Miss Lesley with her own business
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
she as a condition of that doctor
 
03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
signing the collaboration agreement asks
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
her to pick up any additional
 
03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:19.150 align:start position:0%
her to pick up any additional
malpractice

03:25:19.150 --> 03:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
malpractice
 
03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
cost most of the time we're talking
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
about Pas who are employees as are the
 
03:25:26.349 --> 03:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
as are the Physicians so they're
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
employed by Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
Center as an example I I would the PA
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to cover the cost of that
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
doc who's employed by Dartmouth
 
03:25:37.389 --> 03:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Medical Center unless unless
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
there's folks behind me who I'm wrong
 
03:25:43.229 --> 03:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's just that's just added cost to
 
03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the employer in that instance so that PA
 
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
covering that cost is only when the PA
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
owns their own business otherwise that's
 
03:25:54.510 --> 03:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
a a cost borne by the
 
03:25:56.830 --> 03:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
employer okay can I rephrase this
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
question AB will this will this bill
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
remove that requirement for the Pas
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
because I feel it's not fair for the PA
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
to carry the doctor's uh malpractice
 
03:26:14.830 --> 03:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
also so that is my question will this
 
03:26:16.670 --> 03:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
clear them thank you for the question
 
03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes it will clear
 
03:26:20.750 --> 03:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
them of that because there will no
 
03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
longer be the need for that signature
 
03:26:24.670 --> 03:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
that legal tether nothing else will
 
03:26:27.070 --> 03:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
change Pas aren't looking to do anything
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
more it's just removing that signature
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
on that document representative Brown uh
 
03:26:36.269 --> 03:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so to to be clear if
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding a doctor has to carry
 
03:26:42.030 --> 03:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
malpractice if they decide to be a
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh liability insurance if they decide to
 
03:26:46.269 --> 03:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
have a collaborative agreement that's in
 
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
addition so if if someone out there says
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
I have to pay for the doctor's liability
 
03:26:53.229 --> 03:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
they're not paying for that doctor's
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
entire malpractice insurance no just for
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
the portion I I think for for simpli I'm
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't mean to interrupt
 
03:27:01.630 --> 03:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative for Simplicity sake it's
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
almost like you're paying for a rider
 
03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:04.630 align:start position:0%
almost like you're paying for a rider
thank

03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:27:07.550 --> 03:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
you okay that will change my vote uh Mr
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
chair if that is going to be removed the
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
burden is removed for Pas I would vote
 
03:27:16.349 --> 03:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
for I'll just quickly uh so everyone in
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
favor I I anyone opposed okay thank you

03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%

03:37:08.110 --> 03:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
anything else is there anybody on the
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with some thoughts on this
 
03:37:09.720 --> 03:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with some thoughts on this
bill

03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you Mr chair I
 
03:37:16.750 --> 03:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
do I've given a lot of thought to this
 
03:37:19.229 --> 03:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
and there are parts and pieces of this
 
03:37:21.870 --> 03:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
bill that dovetail with a couple of
 
03:37:23.710 --> 03:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
other bills this subcommittee has and
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
03:37:29.070 --> 03:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm really feeling strongly like
 
03:37:31.510 --> 03:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's still enough there's some good
 
03:37:32.950 --> 03:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
stuff in here and there's some stuff
 
03:37:34.750 --> 03:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to come out of here for sure
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
and so I would like to propose that we
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
do interim study on this bill so that it
 
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
gives an opportunity for more time and
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
to coordinate this with the other bills
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
that have related topics would you like
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
to make that in the form of motion that
 
03:37:53.790 --> 03:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
we can have I Mo interm study on House
 
03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:54.710 align:start position:0%
we can have I Mo interm study on House
Bill

03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
1408 I second it okay h on all right
 
03:38:04.349 --> 03:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
well we'll have discussion yep
 
03:38:08.830 --> 03:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative um Brown thank you
 
03:38:11.950 --> 03:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh would it is would it be would it work
 
03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:17.070 align:start position:0%
uh would it is would it be would it work
to

03:38:17.070 --> 03:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
just uh postpone this and keep working
 
03:38:20.670 --> 03:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
on it a little more to see if it
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
dovetails with those other bills because
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
interim study is going to kick it down
 
03:38:26.110 --> 03:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
the road so here's the scheduling
 
03:38:28.269 --> 03:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
problem with that okay
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
um we have I haven't got the final list
 
03:38:33.189 --> 03:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
um just a little bit on for the
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on scheduling
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
so um uh chair Maguire wants to exact
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
all of the remaining um Edna house
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
builds on the 13th of
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
March if not
 
03:38:51.070 --> 03:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
before because we're coming up you know
 
03:38:52.030 --> 03:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to be coming up on the
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
crossover deadline and we don't want to
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
go down to the last
 
03:38:57.870 --> 03:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
minute um I and others are going to be
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
out of town all of next week which means
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
we will
 
03:39:06.189 --> 03:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
have the week of let me my calendar out
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
here yeah so we the week the week
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
starting the 4th I'm not going to be
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
back in town until the
 
03:39:12.600 --> 03:39:14.429 align:start position:0%
back in town until the
3

03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
3
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so we have that week except there's a
 
03:39:20.590 --> 03:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
not a reasonable there's some chance
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's probably not going to be a
 
03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
session on Thursday the 7th but we don't
 
03:39:25.070 --> 03:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
know that I actually asked the deputy
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
speaker at the last session and he said
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
he couldn't guarantee we
 
03:39:29.399 --> 03:39:31.790 align:start position:0%
he couldn't guarantee we
wouldn't

03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
um and we have a number of other bills
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
still to
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
do and then even if we get into the next
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
week there's Monday and Tuesday before
 
03:39:41.469 --> 03:39:41.479 align:start position:0%
the 13th but if we run it down till
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and we need an amendment that's
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
tight so I think the answer is we really
 
03:39:48.590 --> 03:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
03:39:52.110 --> 03:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
time to do further work on the bill this
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
legislative session and partly that's
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
because we've had a number of other huge
 
03:39:58.030 --> 03:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
bills that took a ton of work
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative gold and I and I would
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
just say that I think this committee's
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
done a lot of good work on these bills
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
certainly on what is it 1676 and the
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
same would be true here if we were to
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
slug through it I just think time isn't
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
working for us and that the good work
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
we've done should be preserved by
 
03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
kicking it down the road as one term but
 
03:40:25.030 --> 03:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
also allowing ourselves the time it will
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
take in the future to address it for you
 
03:40:30.030 --> 03:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
and and just my these are my thoughts um
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
on this is that the um in the analysis
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
section the second part that merg merges
 
03:40:37.870 --> 03:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
um all the mental health related boards
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
I that's a big complicated issue maybe
 
03:40:42.990 --> 03:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to merge some but not all
 
03:40:46.189 --> 03:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
of them and the problem is um we just
 
03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the time to do a good job of
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe okay so there's Mr
 
03:40:52.990 --> 03:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I represent MTI yeah thank
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I know I'm far in your
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
Outfield you can join us you joined us
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
up here it's okay I'm too lazy to carry
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
my whole baggage here to up there so uh
 
03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
but I think yeah come on let's let's be
 
03:41:11.469 --> 03:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
polite yeah uh so
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
I um identify with your sentiment
 
03:41:17.469 --> 03:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
especially the second one merger of
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
mental health practices there's so many
 
03:41:23.309 --> 03:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
changes so and it's a high critical need
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
if you don't do a good job and botch it
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
up you're going to make the situation
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
even wor we could make it worse maybe we
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
can make it better but maybe we to make
 
03:41:33.429 --> 03:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
it better we'd have
 
03:41:35.469 --> 03:41:35.479 align:start position:0%
to I'm almost certainly we'd have to
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
change it because I'm not sure they
 
03:41:39.550 --> 03:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
putting all them make sense so given all
 
03:41:41.550 --> 03:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
those things things and the time
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
constraint and so many different things
 
03:41:48.269 --> 03:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
I think it would be less rushed if he
 
03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
postpone it and give it a study
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee and give it to due diligence I
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
agree and so on the first one Architects
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
and Landscape Architects I mean I'm
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
whether that makes sense or not I'm not
 
03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
sure that makes sense um you mean to
 
03:42:07.030 --> 03:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
join them I mean you know may maybe
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
making Landscape Architects advisory or
 
03:42:10.510 --> 03:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
something who knows I mean that's
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
something we could look at doing there's
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
other things we could do there and then
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of them
 
03:42:18.910 --> 03:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
are uh changes to the membership of a
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
number of other boards and as we saw in
 
03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:21.870 align:start position:0%
number of other boards and as we saw in
hb1

03:42:21.870 --> 03:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
1271 um the proposed changes that came
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
out of the governor's office I think go
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
along with his goal of having to do less
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
appointments but I'm not sure they're
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
all some might be appropriate and we
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
agreed with some on that but some may
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
not and we would have to plow through
 
03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
each one of those individually and I
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
took a look at them and I don't think
 
03:42:43.630 --> 03:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
that any of them are Urgent or going to
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
make some huge Improvement in the short
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
term so that's kind of my thinking and I
 
03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
agree any anyone else want to speak
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
before we vote on motion I totally agree
 
03:42:56.149 --> 03:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
with your sentiment Mr CH okay anyone
 
03:42:58.630 --> 03:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
else uh thank you Mr chair will this
 
03:43:00.670 --> 03:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
throw any kind of a monkey wrench into
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
opl's plans or is this yeah actually if
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh director in courtne if you can
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
comment and are any of these I mean I
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
looked at this I didn't see any case
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
where we're fixing a conflict like the
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
um Jackie non gerain Amendment where you
 
03:43:15.070 --> 03:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
act we've given authority to more than
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
one place or
 
03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
something no this bill was not intended
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
to address conflicts it's mainly to
 
03:43:24.189 --> 03:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
address structure so it's not going to
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to operate okay thank
 
03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
you um represent
 
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
Bailey what the what's the timeline and
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
interim study or what's the effect of
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
that so so here's interim study is used
 
03:43:37.870 --> 03:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally in a number of different
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
ways um one as was done with my bill
 
03:43:43.710 --> 03:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:43:46.510 --> 03:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
1676 it it allows
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
for some us to do something else with
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
the idea so for example as as uh
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
represent groa graciely suggested we
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
could do although I think she's thinking
 
03:43:57.790 --> 03:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
about doing something after this session
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
but you know we could but we could have
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
let's say um added an amendment to some
 
03:44:05.309 --> 03:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
other Bill if we wanted to or you know
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
non-main Amendment or the Senate could
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
do something but if we ited it they
 
03:44:09.520 --> 03:44:10.710 align:start position:0%
do something but if we ited it they
couldn't

03:44:10.710 --> 03:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
03:44:12.510 --> 03:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
um the you know the other way it's used
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
is kind of a polite kill we're not you
 
03:44:16.189 --> 03:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
know say you're not going to study it
 
03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
but whatever we don't want to quite we
 
03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
don't feel that we want to say we hate
 
03:44:22.990 --> 03:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
the idea uh but the other one actually
 
03:44:25.630 --> 03:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
is where we really study it and I mean
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
one example was while I was on
 
03:44:30.189 --> 03:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
Edna um I ended up chairing a interim
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
study subcommittee on the um on the very
 
03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:34.910 align:start position:0%
study subcommittee on the um on the very
um

03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
high-profile uh issue of grease traps
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
but it turns it turns out that we
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually managed to get agreement
 
03:44:46.830 --> 03:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
between uh the dees and the building
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
code review board where they work
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
together and came up with a solution to
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
the problem that didn't need future
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislation they did some rule changing
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
training of their staff and you know
 
03:44:58.750 --> 03:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
something really good was done with an
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
interim study and that can happen too or
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
interim study like in this one the
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
interim study might look at it and and
 
03:45:07.750 --> 03:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
come up with a new bill that has some
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
elements maybe of this or maybe you know
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
other things so anyway that's the way
 
03:45:12.159 --> 03:45:12.830 align:start position:0%
other things so anyway that's the way
them

03:45:12.830 --> 03:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
studies yeah IM not to right and and if
 
03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at all the Senate
 
03:45:22.269 --> 03:45:22.279 align:start position:0%
licensing bills but if the senate had
 
03:45:25.950 --> 03:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
some pieces of this if we ited it that
 
03:45:28.349 --> 03:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
could stand in the way of those so I was
 
03:45:31.790 --> 03:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
just going to ask Mr chair if the um
 
03:45:34.830 --> 03:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
answer in your previous was the solution
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
in your previous committee on grease
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
traps an anti-g greasing solution
 
03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:40.990 align:start position:0%
traps an anti-g greasing solution
solution

03:45:40.990 --> 03:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
anti uh it was to expand the options on
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the type of grease traps and the size
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
and exceptions process I was just
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
teasing and I've been known to play
 
03:45:51.720 --> 03:45:54.790 align:start position:0%
teasing and I've been known to play
straight

03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.469 --> 03:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
man yeah I was I was impressed um U
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Brown so to follow up on
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
res representative Bailey's question and
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
to translate what you said this could go
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
through till oh you asked about
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
thetically well in effect I mean this
 
03:46:13.469 --> 03:46:13.479 align:start position:0%
bill would itself would not move forward
 
03:46:16.030 --> 03:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
so uh to do anything else in this
 
03:46:17.710 --> 03:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to put in a bill and
 
03:46:19.469 --> 03:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
during the filing period in the
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
fall and that could be you know one of
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
the things inim studies can do is they
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
get together and they can rem recommend
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
future legislation and then somebody
 
03:46:30.830 --> 03:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
typically a member of the subcommittee
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
but doesn't have to can submit that as
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
an LSR in the fall and move forward with
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
that bill that's how it works they can
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
do anyway recommended not correct
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
correct but interim study I mean it says
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
we and actually what happen we do want
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
to work on this that's the idea and and
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
presumably you know uh uh chair Maguire
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
will put together a subcommittee to do
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
it you know she'll ask if people are
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
interested somebody will chair it and
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
then they can meet um and come up with
 
03:47:04.189 --> 03:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
something excuse me anybody wants to
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
work on it work you should put your mic
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
on because we are on oh that's true if
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
you want to speak that's you know we're
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
we're still I haven't closed it yet so
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and this is a public meeting so
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey thank you so one
 
03:47:18.910 --> 03:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the options would be the three
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
disparate Parts could be broken into
 
03:47:24.149 --> 03:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
three disparate abely absolutely future
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't mean one bill and so
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
the success of two are not manacled to
 
03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
the third that's true that's true all
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
right um if we can move on move to vote
 
03:47:36.510 --> 03:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
the motion is interim study on House
 
03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:37.990 align:start position:0%
the motion is interim study on House
Bill

03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:47:43.349 --> 03:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
1408 um all in favor I I anyone
 
03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
opposed hearing none that's five to zero
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what we'll recommend to the
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
ful Edna given that I'm closing the
 
03:47:53.070 --> 03:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on House Bill
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
1408 um a little bit more on scheduling
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I've gotten input on
 
03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
availability uh certainly just before
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
everybody leaves I want you all to know
 
03:48:09.229 --> 03:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
that um I'm aware of any tendency there
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
might for people to feel like this is a
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
concern that will prolong the misery of
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
mental health boards and and that that's
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
not at all the intention of this and
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
that I think that you'll find any future
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
committees working well with the mental
 
03:48:28.590 --> 03:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
health um boards right I'd like to thank
 
03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
people for showing up I know it's taken
 
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
your time and uh some are you getting
 
03:48:36.189 --> 03:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
pay to be here but others not and we
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
really didn't know we were going to vote
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
that until moments ago wasn't like we
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
could have gotten wor and you know uh
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
one thing when I before I ran for State
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
Rep I come up here and testified on
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
bills and I always wondered whether it
 
03:48:50.830 --> 03:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
made a difference and I'll tell you my
 
03:48:53.229 --> 03:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
experience being on the other side is
 
03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it does because um you know most
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
bills there's something in there that's
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
brought up that we had no idea so
 
03:49:00.399 --> 03:49:01.670 align:start position:0%

03:49:07.950 --> 03:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
input from some people on
 
03:49:12.189 --> 03:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:14.830 --> 03:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay if you can do that in the next I
 
03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
what I it is is I'm going out of town
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
starting Saturday and before that I need
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
to send an email to schedule public
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%

03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%

need it today I'm not going to send it
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
out today so if if you can send me an
 
03:49:38.710 --> 03:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
email that's better because otherwise
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'll lose it forget it or because I'm
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
going have to sit down and do the we of
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's the week of the 4th but also the
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
first day or two of the following week
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
although I'd like to avoid that Tuesday
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
because that means if we have an
 
03:49:56.389 --> 03:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
amendment on a bill we'll be up against
 
03:49:57.870 --> 03:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
we could do we get all us to do a quick
 
03:49:59.309 --> 03:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment a reminder that Tuesday is
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
Town election all right and that
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
Tuesday's Town election which another
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
reason not to do that day okay so we
 
03:50:05.239 --> 03:50:06.469 align:start position:0%
reason not to do that day okay so we
only

03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:50:16.020 --> 03:50:16.030 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:16.030 --> 03:50:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh oh Carol told me that um she doesn't
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
plan on
 
03:50:25.950 --> 03:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
meeting there might be subcommittee
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
meetings doesn't plan on a full
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee meeting until the 13th oh so
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
then that opens up right we might have
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
session on the 7th so I'll avoid that
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
456 so 4568 are in theory open and did
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
you you sent me that I looked okay and
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
then Monday following if we have to I
 
03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:47.309 align:start position:0%
then Monday following if we have to I
have

03:50:47.309 --> 03:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:50:56.189 --> 03:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.199 --> 03:51:02.269 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:51:02.269 --> 03:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
maybe I hope we don't have
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
